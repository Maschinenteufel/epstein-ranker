It was\nfollowed by two large American cars, with the Syrian officers, and then a\ntrailing security vehicle. It was too late. I was fuming. The convoy had passed\nwithin a couple of yards of us, moving slowly because of the incline. But,\nregaining my composure, | realized we’d get another opportunity, when the\nofficers returned from their inspection visit. We now knew exactly how the\nconvoy was deployed, and with any luck, the security men would be less alert\nby the end of the day. Even better, it would be beginning to get dark, perfect\nconditions for the ambush.\n\nBut as we were waiting, Amit radioed me with a question from from Dado\nand Motta. “Where’s the armored car?” It’s still there, at the bottom of the road,\nI told them. “But there’s nothing it can do.” Bibi and his team had it in their\nsights. I considered not telling Amit what happened a few minutes later: a\nLebanese shepherd, with a half-dozen sheep, stumbled on us. One of Uzi’s men,\nfluent in Arabic, tied the startled man’s arms behind his back, scattered the\nsheep, and told him: “It’s fine. Another hour or so, we’ll be gone, and we’ll let\nyou go.” It turned out to be less than an hour. Forty-five minutes. During which,\nnot once but twice, Amit told us that Dado and Motta were worried: about the\narmored car and now about the shepherd. I assured him everything was fine.\nWe'd do the operation. The guys in the armored car would be helpless. If all\nwent well, they might not even know we’d intercepted the convoy. The\nshepherd, like us, was just waiting for it to be over so we could all go home.\nMinutes later, Amit called again. He told us the convoy was on its way down.\nBut barely 60 seconds later, he said: “It’s off. Don’t do it. Dado told me to\nrepeat it twice so you’d understand: do not do the operation.”\n\nWhen we got back to the command post, not only were Dado and Motta\nthere. Since Motta was within days of leaving to become Israel’s military\nattaché in Washington, they’d been joined by his successor as head of the\nnorthern command, Yitzhak Hofi. Three times, I suggested to Dado that we\nspeak without my officers present. I did not feel it was nght to have Uzi,\nMookie and Bibi hear me the generals how I felt. But Dado insisted there was\nno reason for them to leave.\n\n“This is a serious issue,” I said, trying to keep my emotions in check. “What\nhappened out there is unacceptable.

Contaminant testing typically includes testing for the following: (1)\npesticides; (2) residual solvents; (3) heavy metals; (4) moisture content; (5) mycotoxins;\nand (6) microorganisms.\n\nFor the most part, standards and regulations for cannabis potency and contaminants\ntesting are still in the infancy stage and vary widely by state - accordingly, testing of\ncannabis products vary greatly by locality. The aforementioned tests (also in Figure 13)\nare the most commonly performed tests.

We keep learning about walking throughout our lives be-\ncause things change.\n\nBabies predict what will happen when they cry. They don’t start\nout making such predictions. They learn to expect results that they\nhave already experienced. These are scripts, and I have discussed them\nat length elsewhere.’ Scripts are acquired naturally as a result of re-\npeated sequences of events. We predict what will happen next because\nwe know the script. Scripts are not normally taught because they are\nreadily acquired from living. But what if you want to teach them? You\nmight want to teach them in a situation where someone’s new job is\na script and rather than learn that job from repeated experience, there\nis a desire to jump-start the process by simply teaching the script. How\ncan we do this?\n\nThere is also prediction that is not script-based. In other words,\nthere could well be a script but the predictor doesn’t know it. How can\none learn to predict well if one does not have a script?\n\nAnd lastly, there is often the need to predict when there couldn't\npossibly be a script because what needs to be predicted is novel, at\nleast to the predictor. How can the prediction be made? More impor-\ntant, how can someone be taught to predict in that kind of situation?\n\nThese, then, are the three aspects of prediction: learning a script;\nfunctioning without a script because it isn’t known; and predicting\nwhen there is no script.\n\nHow do we teach these things? Scripts are learned through repeti-\ntion. No one seeks to explain to a child that since she will be doing\nsomething again and again, she will now memorize the steps before\nshe tries it out for the first time. Instead, we take the child through\nthe steps until she has learned them. There is no need to try to teach a\nchild scripts (such as how restaurants function or airplane rides go or\nschool procedure works). We can say some words about these things,\nof course, but the learning comes from repeated practice no matter\nwhat we do.\n\nTeachers (and course designers) often fail to understand about\nteaching scripts. Talking about what a student will have to do later will\nnot help that student do what he is being asked to do. We don’t learn\nscripts consciously and thus aren’t likely to remember what we are\nconsciously told about what to do. We are conscious when we execute\na script—we are thinking about what will happen next—but not so\nmuch in words as in expectations of next events.

The aim was not\ntarget the nearly 250,000 Lebanese civilians who lived in the immediate border\narea. It was to use our attacks, along with leaflet drops and radio messages, to\nencourage them to flee north. My assessment was that this would bring pressure\non the Lebanese government and, through the Lebanese, on the real power in\nLebanon, the Syrians. I doubted Damascus would respond directly by telling\nHizbollah to cease fire. I did believe they’d be ready to engage with American\nefforts to stop the fighting, and that Rabin and the government could then secure\nterms we were prepared to accept.\n\nOn July 25, we began our heaviest air strikes since 1982. Far from producing\na sign of a climb-down by Hizbollah, it responded with intensified rocket fire.\nWe escalated over the following 24 hours, but still with no indication of any\nchange from Hizbollah. So as planned, we expanded our bombing to wider\nareas of south Lebanon. Sadly, some Lebanese civilians were killed, which I’m\nsure was a much greater cause of concern to us than to Hizbollah.

In south Lebanon, this meant that our jets and\nartillery had much greater freedom of operation against Hizbollah, which had\nnow lost its human shields.

INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORP.\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting\n\nWere we to interpret the statute statically, then, the\ndefault rule would be immunity in suits arising from an\norganization’s commercial activities. But the Executive\nBranch would have the power to withdraw immunity\nwhere immunity is not warranted, as the Act itself pro-\nvides. And in making that determination, it could con-\nsider whether allowing the lawsuit would jeopardize the\norganization’s ability to carry out its public interest tasks.\nIn a word, the Executive Branch, under a static interpre-\ntation, would have the authority needed to separate law-\nsuit sheep from lawsuit goats.\n\nUnder the majority’s interpretation, by contrast, there is\nno such flexibility. The Executive does not have the power\nto tailor immunity by taking into account the risk of a\nlawsuit’s unjustified interference with institutional objec-\ntives or other institutional needs. Rather, the majority’s\nholding takes away an international organization’s im-\nmunity (in cases arising from “commercial” activities)\nacross the board. And without a new statute, there is no\nway to restore it, in whole or in part. Nothing in the\npresent statute gives the Executive, the courts, or the\norganization the power to restore immunity, or to tailor\nany resulting potential liability, where a lawsuit threatens\nseriously to interfere with an organization’s legitimate\nneeds and goals.\n\nThus, the static interpretation comes equipped with\nflexibility. It comes equipped with a means to withdraw\nimmunity where justified. But the dynamic interpretation\nfreezes potential liability into law. It withdraws immunity\nautomatically and irretrievably, irrespective of institu-\ntional harm.

He created TOR’s main exit\nnode in Hawaii in 2012. This activity required a two gigabyte server called “The Signal,” which\nhe described as the largest TOR relay station in Honolulu.\n\nSandvik first heard directly from Snowden in November 2012. At the time, he wrote her\nunder the alias “Cincinnatus,” but also supplied his real name and address in Hawaii so that she\ncould supply him with TOR stickers. So she knew his identity seven months before he went\npublic. He would later tell Sandvik from Moscow that he had been “moonlighting” on behalf of\nthe TOR cause at the NSA. By “moonlighting” he meant that in 2012 he had two jobs: Officially\nhe was working as an NSA system administrator; unofficially he was working to advance the\nTOR Project. He added, with some understatement, that his moonlighting was “something the\nNSA might not have been too happy about.”\n\nBy November 2012, while still working for Dell at the NSA, his dual role led him to organize a\n“crypto party” aimed at finding new recruits for TOR. The “crypto party” movement itself had\nbeen started in 2011 in Australia by Asher Wolf, a radical hacktavist and anarchist living in\nMelbourne. She promoted them not unlike the tupper-ware parties of the 1950s. They worked as\nfollows. The party organizer, usually with a representative of the TOR project, advertised the\nparty on the Internet. Attendees were encouraged to bring their own laptops so they could install\nTOR as well encryption software in them. The attendees then would be instructed on how to use\nit. Finally, those converted to TOR software would be told to proselytize about its virtues by\nholding their own “crypto party.” Wolf’s idea was to use these gatherings to expand the realm of\nTOR.\n\nOn November 18, 2012, Snowden launched his initial crypto party. It was called the “Oahu\nCrypto party” and had its own web page. He told Asher Wolf that it would be the first Crypto\nparty in Honolulu. She wrote him back, advising him to “keep it simple.”(Wolf later said she did\nnot know he was working at the NSA.)\n\nSnowden apparently had no inhibitions in staging a party which the NSA might consider\nsubversive of its battle against TOR. He even invited his fellow NSA workers in Hawaii as well\nas Others in the local computer culture. He asked Sandvik, who was living in Washington DC at\nthe time, to participate, proposing that she co-host it with him in Honolulu. He scheduled it for\nDecember 11, 2012. He suggested that TOR stickers that could be used as “swag” to lure an\naudience. According to her account, Snowden informed he that he “had been talking to some\nof the more technical guys at work into setting up some additional fast servers” for TOR. His\n“work” place at the time was the NSA. If so, he had already attempted to find co-workers at the\nNSA who might be interested in attending an anti-NSA surveillance presentation.\n\nSandvik not only agreed a to be Snowden’s co-presenter but she made the Oahu Crypto party a\nTOR-sponsored event. Sandvik flew to Honolulu on December 6, 2012. It was a fourteen hour\nflight and a relatively expensive one.

Results\nof the meta-analysis suggested the\ninterventions might be effective, but to\nknow it’s the intervention and not an\nartifact of subject selection, we need to\nlook at the effect of these interventions\nwhen assessed using randomized group\ncomparison designs in which\nparticipants are randomly assigned to the\nexperimental or control group.\n\nTwenty-two studies utilized such\na design. Quantitative analysis revealed\nthat, on average, the interventions had a\nsmall but significant effect in reducing\nloneliness. Moreover, efficacy in\nreducing loneliness did not differ\nsignificantly as a function of\nintervention strategy nor as a function of\nindividual- versus group-based\nimplementation. Whereas once a\nconsensus existed that social skills\ntraining and/or group activities could\nreduce loneliness, we found insufficient\nevidence to support that conclusion.\n\nWhy have successful\ninterventions to reduce loneliness been\nso elusive? There are several possible\nreasons. Some of the interventions have\nbeen designed with the notion that if\nonly lonely individuals had better social\nskills they would be able to form\nsatisfying connections with others.\nHowever, recent research suggests that\nat least for most adults, the social skills\nthey know are not related to the\nloneliness they feel. Other interventions\nhave been developed with the notion that\nlonely individuals simply need to\ninteract more with others, so the\ninterventions are designed to increase\n\n134\n\nPage\n\ncontact with others. However, people\nnot only tend to like lonely individuals\nless than nonlonely individuals, lonely\nindividuals are especially negative\ntoward other lonely individuals.\nTherefore, bringing lonely individuals\ntogether is unlikely to result in warm,\nsatisfying social connections. Finally,\nsome interventions were designed with\nthe notion that what lonely individuals\nneed is social support, such as someone\nwho is available to provide help when\nneeded. However, loneliness affects not\nonly how people think, but how people\nthink about others: loneliness\ndiminishes people’s executive\nfunctioning and biases them to see others\nas threatening and rejecting even when\nthey are not (5).\n\nCacioppo and Patrick (5)\nproposed a framework for reducing\nloneliness which includes four elements.\nFirst, unconscious barriers that\nchronically lonely people develop to\nshield against being hurt by others tend\nto reduce their likelihood of having\npositive social interactions, and they\nmay benefit, therefore, from\nencouragement and practice in forming\nsocial connections gradually in “safe”\nenvironments where threat of rejection is\nminimal. For instance, because\nchronically lonely people are self-\nfocused in their hypervigilance for social\nthreat, they may benefit from learning to\nshift their attention from themselves to\nothers through other-oriented activities\nsuch as volunteerism. The notion is to\nintervene to diminish or eliminate the\nnegative effects loneliness can have on\nsocial perception and cognition. Second,\nwe tend to think of loneliness as the\nsame thing as a personal weakness, as\nbeing a social isolate, being depressed,\nor being weak.

Further,\nthe chapters are somewhat variant in their levels of detail — some very nitty-gritty, some more\nhigh level, with much of the variation due to how much concrete work has been done on the\ntopic of the chapter at time of writing. However, it is important to understand that the ideas\npresented here are not mere armchair speculation — they are currently being used as the basis\nfor an open-source software project called OpenCog, which is being worked on by software\ndevelopers around the world. Right now OpenCog embodies only a percentage of the overall\nCogPrime design as described here. But if OpenCog continues to attract sufficient funding\nor volunteer interest, then the ideas presented in these volumes will be validated or refuted\nvia practice. (As a related note: here and there in this book, we will refer to the \"current\"\nCogPrime implementation (in the OpenCog framework); in all cases this refers to OpenCog as\nof late 2013.)\n\nTo state one believes one knows a workable path to creating a human-level (and potentially\ngreater) general intelligence is to make a dramatic statement, given the conventional way of\nthinking about the topic in the contemporary scientific community. However, we feel that once\na little more time has passed, the topic will lose its drama (if not its interest and importance),\nand it will be widely accepted that there are many ways to create intelligent machines — some\nsimpler and some more complicated; some more brain-like or human-like and some less so; some\nmore efficient and some more wasteful of resources; etc. We have little doubt that, from the\nperspective of AGI science 50 or 100 years hence (and probably even 10-20 years hence), the\nspecific designs presented here will seem awkward, messy, inefficient and circuitous in various\nrespects. But that is how science and engineering progress. Given the current state of knowledge\nand understanding, having any concrete, comprehensive design and plan for creating AGI is\na significant step forward; and it is in this spirit that we present here our thinking about the\nCogPrime architecture and the nature of general intelligence.\n\nIn the words of Sir Edmund Hillary, the first to scale Everest: “Nothing Venture, Nothing\nWin.”\n\nPrehistory of the Book\n\nThe writing of this book began in earnest in 2001, at which point it was informally referred to\nas “The Novamente Book.” The original “Novamente Book” manuscript ultimately got too big\nfor its own britches, and subdivided into a number of different works — The Hidden Pattern\n[Goe06a], a philosophy of mind book published in 2006; Probabilistic Logic Networks [GIGHO8],\na more technical work published in 2008; Real World Reasoning [GGC\" 11], a sequel to Proba-\nbilistic Logic Networks published in 2011; and the two parts of this book.\n\nThe ideas described in this book have been the collaborative creation of multiple overlapping\ncommunities of people over a long period of time. The vast bulk of the writing here was done by\nBen Goertzel; but Cassio Pennachin and Nil Geisweiller made sufficient writing, thinking and\nediting contributions over the years to more than merit their inclusion of co-authors. Further,\nmany of the chapters here have co-authors beyond the three main co-authors of the book; and\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012904\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The allegations first surfaced in British\nnewspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein’s friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to\npublicly disassociate himself from his old pal.\n\nI wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called “The Talented Mr. Epstein.” It was largely a business piece that\nfocused on his mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les\nWexner, the chairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude\nHoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of\n$450 million.\n\nThe piece alluded to Epstein’s great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women\nwith whom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn’t really go there, focusing instead on the\nissue that remains a mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers.\n\nThis is not to say I didn’t hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I\nconcentrated on the intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same\nones, different ones. And their stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one\ncase, flown—to ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he?

Dogs usually know the scripts that pertain\nto them, as well. They know which merchant will have the dog biscuit\nfor them, for example.\n\nPeople seem astonishingly dumb when they can’t predict what\nis obvious to everyone else. Not knowing what will happen next in\na script you don’t know, because you don’t have the relevant experi-\nence, means nothing at all, of course. The question is: If you have\nexperienced something repeatedly, why haven’t you figured out that\nwhat you have seen before will happen again?\n\nScript following is, therefore, a sign of intelligence but a very lim-\nited one. We can blindly follow a script, and this can make us seem\ndumb indeed. Since scripts vary one from the other in many ways,\nthe ability to see the nuances makes all the difference. Expecting that\na fast-food restaurant will be the same as a three-star Michelin res-\ntaurant because it is a restaurant after all is what makes people seem\nstupid. Failing to make the right generalizations indicates a lack of\nthought.\n\nThe real question is this: What do you do when your script fails?\nThis is important because scripts fail all the time. You expect some-\nthing to happen and it doesn’t. You love the cheesecake at Lindy’s and\nsuddenly it doesn’t serve cheesecake. Or you find that Lindy’s is now\nout of business. What do you do? People recover from script failure on\na daily basis. How they do this tells us a lot about how the mind works.\n\nWhen people refuse to abandon the generalizations they have\nmade, they immediately are perceived as being stupid. When a medi-\ncal assistant asked me the other day about the upcoming Thanksgiv-\ning holiday, I responded that I would be eating duck instead of turkey.\nShe said that sounded awful and that duck was greasy and gamey and\nit sounded like a terrible idea. I asked her if she had ever eaten duck\nand she said no because it was game and she hated game. I told her it\nwasn’t gamey. She refused to believe me. I was about to recommend\ntrying magret de canard but thought better of it and asked if she had\never eaten in a French restaurant in her life. She said that she hadn't.\n\nPeople who have scripts often generalize them so that in their own\nminds they experts on things that they have never experienced. This\nis what stupid looks like.\n\nOn the other hand, we might wonder what smart looks like. Let’s\nimagine the same woman with the same beliefs hearing me say that\nduck was not gamey or greasy.

Yet within\nweeks, the emphasis in the Israeli political debate shifted to which parts we\nwould keep: the Sinai and the Golan almost certainly, as well as the Jordan\nValley and a number of areas of past Jewish settlement on the West Bank.

Throughout the summer, there\nwere clashes along our new “border” with Egypt: the Suez Canal. In September,\nall the Arab states adopted a platform which became known as the “three no’s”.\nThey rejected not just the idea of peace, but peace talks, or recognition of the\nState of Israel. And in October, Egyptian missile boats attacked and sunk Israel’s\nlargest warship, the destroyer Eilat, killing nearly 50 people on board.\n\nWithout this renewed violence, perhaps, we in Israel might have been able to\nconsider more deeply the future implications of our victory in the Six-Day War.\nThe gains on the battlefield, of course, were clear to everyone.

There is no assurance that cannabinoid-derived pharmaceuticals or\nother medical products will prove effective in treating medical conditions or achieve broad mar-\nket acceptance.\n\n* Given the emerging nature of the cannabis industry, there is a scarcity of qualified personnel with\ndeep industry experience and significant competition for such qualified personnel. Many canna-\nbis companies may not be successful in attracting, training, integrating, motivating or retaining\nqualified management teams and other personnel.\n\n¢ Cannabis is an agricultural product. The occurrence of diseases, insects, pests, mold and other\ninfestations and severe adverse environmental conditions, such as fire, drought, hail, flood or\nfrost, is unpredictable, may have a potentially devastating impact on agricultural production of\ncannabis and may otherwise adversely affect the supply of cannabis.\n\n¢ The cannabis industry is particularly vulnerable to rapidly changing technology, government\nregulation and relatively high risks of obsolescence caused by scientific and technological\nadvances. The success of cannabis companies will depend in part on their ability to anticipate\nmarket, legal, technological and other trends in the industry. Many cannabis companies will fail\nto accurately identify or predict industry trends.\n\n* Cannabis laws and regulations in jurisdictions outside the United States vary widely and, in\nsome cases, are as complex, contradictory and rapidly changing as those within the United States.\nCannabis companies operating outside the country’s borders are subject to risks related to the\nunsettled legal environment applicable to cannabis.\n\n¢ Due to federal controls on cannabis within the United States and similar restrictions in many\njurisdictions outside the country, there is a significant black market for cannabis products.\nGovernment-regulated cannabis businesses face competition from black market participants and\nare subject to different market forces than those of the black market.\n\n168 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024804\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

LEFKOWITZ, ESQ.\nMay 19, 2008\nPAGE 5 OF 6\n\nC. “Mr. Epstein Does Not Believe He Is Guilty Of The Federal Charges Enumerated\nUnder Section 2255.”\n\nAt our December 14, 2007 meeting at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami, counsel for\nEpstein announced, inter alia, that it was a “profound injustice” to require Epstein to register as a\nsex offender and reiterated that no federal crime, especially 18 U.S.C. Section 2422(b), had been\ncommitted since the statute is only violated if a telephone or means of interstate commerce is used\nto do the persuading or inducing. This particular attack on this statute had been previously raised and\nthoroughly considered and rejected by the SDFL and CEOS prior to the execution of the Agreement.\nYou also argued that the facts were inapplicable to the contemplated state statutes and that Epstein\nshould not have been allowed to have been induced into the Agreement because the facts were not\n\n\"what he understood them to be. It should be noted that the SDFL.has never provided you with any\n\nevidence supporting its investigation. This is not, and has never been, an Alford plea situation (see\nNorth Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160 (1970)). Ultimately, you requested an\nindependent review.\n\nSubsequent to the above-mentioned meeting, the SDFL received three letters from you and/or\nMr. Starr which expanded on some of the themes announced in the December 14” meeting.\nEssentially, you portrayed the SDFL as trying to coerce’a plea to unknown allegations and incoherent\ntheories. On December 17, 2007, you decreed that Epstein’s conduct did not meet the requirements\n\nof solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution (FI. Stat. Section 796.03) one of the enumerated\n\ncrimes Epstein had previously agreed to plead guilty to; that Epstein’s conduct does not require\nregistration under Florida law; and the State Attorney’s Office does not believe the conduct is\nregistrable. On December 21, 2007, you rejected the USA’s proposed resolution of the 2255\nprovision because you “strongly believe that the provable conduct of Mr. Epstein with respect to\nthese individuals fails to satisfy the requisite elements of either 18 U.S.C. Section[s] 2422(b) ... or\n.-. 2423(b).” In your December 26, 2007 correspondence you stated that “we have reiterated in\nprevious submissions that Mr. Epstein does not believe he is guilty of the federal charges enumerated\nunder section 2255” and requiring “Mr. Epstein to in essence admit guilt, though he believes he did\nnot commit the requisite offense.”\n\nAs the SDFL has reiterated time and time again, it does not want, nor does it expect, Epstein\n\n\" to plead guilty to a charge he does not believe he committed. As a result, we obliged your request\n\nfor an independent de novo review of the investigation and facilitated such a review at the highest\nlevels of the Department of Justice. It is our understanding that that independent review is now\ncomplete and a determination has been made that there are no impediments to a federal prosecution\nby the SDFL.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012202\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

They monitored the comings and goings of its owner’s\nprivate jet, subpoenaed his phone records and riffled through his trash.\n\nThe owner was Jeffrey Epstein, 53, an intensely private New York money manager with\nseveral billionaire clients. Months earlier, the stepmother of a 14-year-old girl told the\nPalm Beach police that a wealthy older man, whom the girl later identified as Mr.\nEpstein, might have had inappropriate sexual contact with her.\n\nIn sworn statements to the police, the 14-year-old and other teenage girls said a friend\nhad arranged for them to visit Mr. Epstein’s home and give him massages, usually in\ntheir underwear, in exchange for cash.\n\nMost of the girls, according to the police, said Mr. Epstein had masturbated during the\nmassages, and a few said he had penetrated them with his fingers or penis. They\nidentified him in photos and accurately described the inside of his home. Some recalled\nthat his employees had fed them snacks or rented them cars.\n\nMr. Epstein pleaded not guilty in August to the crime he was ultimately charged with,\nsoliciting prostitution. But at a time when prosecutors around the nation have become\nincreasingly severe in dealing with people accused of sex offenses, the case has raised\nquestions about whether Mr. Epstein’s prominence won him preferential treatment.\n\nBy the account of the police, they found probable cause to charge Mr. Epstein with much\nmore serious offenses: one count of lewd and lascivious molestation and four counts of\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor.\n\nBut instead of proceeding with such charges on his own, the Palm Beach County state\nattorney took the rare step of presenting a broad range of possible charges to a grand jury,\nwhich indicted Mr. Epstein in July on the lesser count. In Florida, prosecutors usually\nrefer only capital cases to grand juries.\n\nEven before the indictment, the Palm Beach police chief, Michael Reiter, had accused\nprosecutors of giving Mr. Epstein special treatment and asked the state attorney, Barry E.\nKrischer, to remove himself from the case.\n\nIn an editorial, The Palm Beach Post attacked Mr. Krischer, a Democrat whose post is\nelective, saying the public had been left “to wonder whether the system tilted in favor of\na wealthy, well-connected alleged perpetrator and against very young girls who are\nalleged victims of sex crimes.”\n\nThe case has taken a toll on the reputation of Mr. Epstein, who owns a palatial home in\nManhattan, has pledged $30 million to Harvard and once flew former President Bill\nClinton on his 727. Politicians including Eliot Spitzer, a Democratic candidate for\ngovernor in New York, and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, also a Democrat, have\nreturned campaign contributions from him.\n\nBut Mr. Epstein fought back, assembling a team of star lawyers, including Gerald B.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030307\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Relying on the audit report, they asserted\nseveral causes of action against the IFC, including negli-\ngence, nuisance, trespass, and breach of contract. The\nIFC maintained that it was immune from suit under the\nIOIA and moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction.\n\nThe District Court, applying D.C.

I’ve\nseen it all this year, and attended or even\nparticipated in the major events. I’ve con-\nversed with Chinese leaders and experts,\nand searched for meaning.\n\nI didn’t appreciate the opportunity I've\nhad until I began reviewing the year from\nChina’s domestic perspective, seeking\nthemes and trends, discerning from what\nwe know about the recent past to what we\nmight forecast about the near-term future.\nIt takes no flash of insight to see the leader-\nship and vision of President Xi Jinping\nheadlining almost every event.\n\nFollowing is the review of the meaningful\nevents of 2017.\n\na January: Xi began\nthe year with a memo-\nrable speech at the\nWorld Economic Forum\nin Davos, Switzerland,\nmounting a roaring\ndefense of globaliza-\ntion, free trade, and\neconomic openness and.\nliberalization. It was the\nfirst-ever speech by Chi-\nna’s head of state at\nDavos and, as commentators the world over\nnoted with amazement and irony, as the\nUnited States under President Donald\nTrump was apparently retreating from the\nworld and abrogating global leadership,\nChina under President Xi was apparently\ndefending the international order and pro-\nmoting global governance.\n\nMarch: The annual “two sessions” of the\nNational People’s Congress, China’s top leg-\nislature, and the Chinese People’s Political\nConsultative Conference National Commit-\ntee, the top political advisory body, seemed\nto radiate more energy than usual, perhaps\nin anticipation of the 19th National Con-\ngress of the Communist Party of China in\nthe fall. A highlight was the adoption of the\ndraft general provisions of civil law, a step\ncloser to a long-needed unified civil code.\n\nIsensed delegates’ growing confidence\nand assertiveness to represent their particu-\nJar sectors in the competitive marketplace\nof public ideas and government funding, a\ncompetition that is vital for the develop-\nment of China’s kind of consultative democ-\nracy. This was especially true of the CPPCC\nNational Committee, whose members are\noften leading experts in their fields, such\nthat even though they do not have legal\nauthority to pass laws, they have moral\nauthority to exert pressure and affect\nchange. It did not escape notice that,\nthroughout the “two sessions”, Xi was recog-\nnized repeatedly as “core” of the CPC Cen-\ntral Committee and of the whole Party.\n\nRobert Lawrence\nKuhn\n\nBelt and Road to the fore\n\nMay: The first “Belt and Road Summit”\n(the Belt and Road Forum for International\nCooperation), held in Beijing, was the diplo-\nmatic highlight of the year in China. Some\n130 countries participated, including 29\nheads of state and government. The goal\nwas no less than the transformation of the\neconomic structure of the developing\nworld: building infrastructure and connec-\ntivity, stimulating development, alleviating\npoverty, reducing severe imbalances, pro-\nmoting South-South cooperation, and revi-\ntalizing globalization.\n\nXi called the Belt and Road Initiative “the\nproject of the century”.\n\nJuly: China celebrated the 20th anniver-\nsary of Hong Kong's return to the mother-\nland. It was a time of reflection for the\ncosmopolitan city, long a global leader in\neconomic freedom and competitiveness.\nHong Kong had flourished: its way of life\npreserved, its economy dynamic. But times\nchange. With Shanghai and Shenzhen on\nthe rise, and with some claiming the “one\ncountry, two systems” principle is in\ndecline, Hong Kong faces new challenges.\n\nAugust: The People’s Liberation Army\ncelebrated its 90th anniversary. In a move\nboth practical and symbolic, the PLA estab-\nlished its first overseas logistics base in Dji-\nbouti, situated strategically on the Horn of\nAfrica.\n\nXi Jinping, who is also chairman of the\nCentral Military Commission, said the PLA\nis becoming “strong” informationized\narmed forces. “The Chinese people love\npeace,” Xi said. “We will never seek aggres-\nsion or expansion, but ... No one should\nexpect us to swallow the bitter fruit that is\nharmful to our sovereignty, security or\ndevelopment interests”,\n\nForeigners are wondering: what is the\nPLAs long-term plan for operating over-\nseas? What will be the impact of the PLAS\nmodernization and reform, especially its\nburgeoning blue-water navy with multiple\naircraft carriers?\n\nAugust: China hosted the BRICS Sum-\nmit in Xiamen, East China’s Fujian prov-\nince. The five BRICS countries — Brazil,\nRussia, India, China and South Africa —\nhave increasing influence on global econo-\nmy and politics, but does BRICS as an orga-\nnization make sense? China certainly thinks\nso, and promoted the BRICS Summit as\n\nrepresenting a new kind of multilateral\nglobal governance. There are complexities:\npolitical instabilities in Brazil and South\nAfrica; the growing, comprehensive cooper-\nation between Russia and China; the sen-\nsitive, multifaceted relationship\nbetween India and China.\nThroughout the year, events on the\nKorean Peninsula continued to\nintrude. While China continued to\ncall for denuclearization and dia-\nlogue, just hours before Xi gave\nthe opening speech at the BRICS\nSummit, the Democratic People’s\nRepublic of Korea detonated its\nmost powerful nuclear bomb\never.\n\n19th Party Congress\nand the New Era\n\nOctober: The highlight of the\nyear was, as expected, the 19th\nCPC National Congress. Not quite\nexpected were the far-reaching\nproclamations and, taken together,\nthe magnitude of their significance. I\nwitnessed history and see six high-\nlights.\n\nFirst, Xi’s name and thought were writ-\nten into the CPC Constitution — “Xi Jinping\nThought on Socialism with Chinese Charac-\nteristics for a New Era” Xi is now, officially,\nthe overarching creator and arbiter of polit-\nical thought, and combined with his desig-\nnation as “core” of the CPC, he is now the\nundisputed, unimpeded leader with singu-\nJar authority. Xi Jinping “thought” is built\non the twin pillars of people orientation and\nnational rejuvenation, with the new con-\ncept of development (innovation, coordina-\ntion, green, open, sharing) driving anew\nkind of economic growth.\n\nSecond, the “New Era’, which is intended\nas a policy-energizing game changer, is a\nconceptual lens with which to view the\nrange of goals, strategies and concepts that\ncompose Xi’s way of thinking and the Par-\nty’s new direction.\n\nThe “New Era” is envisioned in three tem-\nporal segments: (i) from now until the ful-\nfillment of China’s first centenary goal of a\n“moderately prosperous society” in 2020\n(2021 being the 100th anniversary of the\nCPC); (ii) from 2020 to 2035, when the CPC\nstates it will build on the foundation of the\nmoderately prosperous society so that, after\n“15 years of hard work’; the country will\n“basically” realize “socialist modernization”;\nand (iii) from 2035 to 2050, when the CPC\nstates it will “work hard for a further 15\nyears” and “develop China into a country\nthat is prosperous, strong, democratic, cul-\nturally advanced, harmonious, and beauti-\nful”. Realizing this vision at mid-century,\naround 2050, with China being respected as\na great, modern, socialist country, is the sec-\nond centenary goal (2049 being the 100th\nanniversary of the People’s Republic of Chi-\nna).\n\nThird, the new “principal contradiction”\nin China’s “New Era” is between “unbal-\nanced and inadequate development” and\n“the people's ever-growing needs for a bet-\nter life’, which includes increasingly broad\ndemands for “democracy, rule of law, fair-\nNess and justice, security, and a better envi-\nronment” From now on, this new-era\nprincipal contradiction, replacing quantita-\ntive GDP growth with qualitative improve-\nment of life, is what will guide China’s\ndomestic affairs and policies.\n\nFourth, the Party’s leadership role in gov-\nerning the country is expanding and the\nParty’s stringent approach to governing\nitself is intensifying. The Party will be more\ndeeply embedded within agencies of gov-\nernment and sectors of society (including\nprivate companies, foreign businesses and\neducational institutions), and by reforming\nand purifying itself, the Party’s governance\nwill be stricter and more comprehensive.\nThe anti-corruption campaign, not only\ncontinues, it has been enhanced.\n\nFifth, the “New Era” has China moving\ncloser to center stage of the world and mak-\ning greater contributions to humanity,\noffering “Chinese wisdom” and “Chinese\nsolutions” for world problems. China’s\ndiplomacy will be proactive, championing\nthe development of a community with a\nshared future for humanity and encourag-\ning the evolution of the global governance\nsystem.\n\nSixth, I watched the new senior leaders of\nChina, the seven members of the new\nStanding Committee of the Political Bureau\nof the CPC Central Committee, walk out on\nstage, ending months, really years, of specu-\nlation and rumor. Because everything in\nChina reports to a Political Bureau Standing\nCommittee member, and because of the\nParty’s principle of collective leadership,\ntheir personalities, composition and bal-\nance determine the vision, strategies and\npolicies that shape China.\n\nThe importance of the Political Bureau\nStanding Committee remains true today,\nbut its importance frankly is also less true\ntoday. It is hard to overstate the conse-\nquences of Xi’s name written into the Party\nConstitution, thus inscribing into perpetu-\nity his predominant status and assuring\nhis continuing pre-eminence in the coun-\n\ntry’s political life.\n\nFollowing the 19th Party Congress, some\nmight have expected a respite, a slower\nNovember and December. They were any-\nthing but.\n\nForm is substance\n\nNovember: The “state visit-plus” of US\nPresident Donald Trump came at a delicate\nmoment. Amid pomp and pageantry,\nincluding a personal tour of the Palace\nMuseum (Forbidden City), $253 billion in\nbusiness deals were signed, a world record,\nthough critics complained it was all trans-\nactional, nothing structural. The number,\nsome said, was more form than substance,\nbut here, perhaps, form was substance.\nBoth Xi and Trump hailed the visit as “suc-\ncessful and historic”.\n\n‘Yet, on sensitive topics, one could be for-\ngiven for seeing sunlight between their\npositions. On trade, Xi lauded the business\ndeals and market access, “which will deliver\ngreat benefits for the two peoples” Trump\nsought improved trade with China based on\n“a level playing field for our workers” and\nsolving the “massive trade distortion” —\nwhich, characteristically, Trump blamed on\npast US administrations, not on China.\n\nOn the Democratic People’s Republic of\nKorea, Xi reiterated China’s firm commit-\nment for a denuclearized Korean Peninsula\nand direct communications, while Trump\nsaid that they “agreed not to replicate failed\napproaches of the past” and he called for\n“increased economic pressure until North\nKorea abandons its reckless and dangerous\npath”,\n\nSubsequent to Trump’s visit, China\nannounced revised regulations that were\nindeed structural. China will reduce or\neliminate (over time) limits on foreign\nownership of financial services sectors,\nincluding insurance, commercial banking,\nsecurities, futures, and asset manage-\nment.\n\nSignificantly, the State Council, China’s\nCabinet, established a Financial Stability\nand Development Committee to oversee\nfinancial stability and boost risk prevention\n(including close monitoring of “shadow\nbanking” and corporate debt). This new\nsupra-ministry commission will be empow-\nered to make decisions related to reform\nand development, coordinate issues con-\ncerning monetary policy, and establish\nfinancial policies and related fiscal and\nindustrial policies, thus improving the\nfinancial regulatory system.\n\nAt the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\nLeaders’ Meeting in Vietnam, Xi strength-\nened his themes of making economic glo-\nbalization more open, balanced and\ninclusive; lauded regional multilateralism\nfor promoting common interests; and\nstressed the Belt and Road Initiative for\nadvancing global connectivity.\n\nWhat struck me in Xi’s speech was what\nhe inserted about poverty: “To lift all the\n\nSHI YU / CHINA DAILY\n\nremaining poor people out of poverty is a\nsolemn commitment made by the Chinese\ngovernment to the people. It is uppermost\nin my mind, and I have spent more energy\non poverty alleviation than on anything\nelse.”\n\n“Upper most in my mind?” “More energy\non poverty alleviation than on anything\nelse?” An extraordinary statement from the\npresident! Although Xi has been making\nhigh-profile visits to numerous poor coun-\nties and villages, relentlessly championing\n“targeted poverty alleviation” for realizing\nthe “moderately prosperous society’; this\nwas his clearest statement that poverty alle-\nviation is his highest priority.\n\nMain contradiction reinforced\n\n‘Two unpleasant events in Beijing rein-\nforced the new “principal contradiction’,\nhighlighting “the people's ever-growing\nneeds for a better life” as that surprisingly\npowerful lens for viewing Chinese society.\nThe first was alleged child abuse at a kin-\ndergarten. The second was a fire in which\n19 migrant workers died. In both cases, net-\nizens reacted with anger: in the alleged.\nchild abuse, anger about a perceived cover-\nup; in the fire, anger for the disorderly and\ninconsiderate way of evacuating migrant\nworkers.\n\nWhen Xi first announced the new princi-\npal contradiction at the 19th Party Con-\ngress, some dismissed it as arcane Party-\nspeak. Public reaction to the alleged child\nabuse and to the fire revealed its prescient\nand perspicacious wisdom.\n\nThe second volume of Xi Jinping: The\nGovernance of China, a collection of 99 of\nXi’s speeches, conversations, instructions\nand letters, was published. The book offers\naresource to follow the development of Xi’s\nways of thinking and ideas and to under-\nstand China’s new guiding philosophy and\nthe specific elements that compose it.\n\nThe month ended with what may seem a\nlight touch when Xi called for China to\nupgrade its toilets. Toilets among the year’s\nhighlights? Xi was serious and his point is\nprobative. For China to become a more civi-\nlized society, the hygiene of the people must\nbe improved (especially in rural areas), and\nfor China’s tourism industry to blossom,\nbetter bathrooms are needed. Although\nChina’s leader talking toilets elicits smiles,\nand some say it downgrades his dignity, it\ndemonstrates, above all, Xi’s intrinsic com-\nmitment to improve the quality of life for\nthe Chinese people.\n\nDecember: In the first nine days of the\nmonth, Xi engaged with four international\nevents, stressing common commitment to\nbuild a community of a shared future for all\nhumanity.\n\nThe four engagements\n\nTo the “CPC in Dialogue with World Polit-\nical Parties High-Level Meeting” Xi\n\nChina’s year for history\n\ndescribed four views of the future: a world\nthat is safe and free of fear; prosperous and\nfree of poverty; open, inclusive and free of\nisolation; and environmentally clean and\nbeautiful.\n\nAt the “Fourth World Internet Confer-\nence’; Xi asserted how the internet posed\nnew challenges for sovereignty, security and\ndevelopment.\n\nAt the “2017 Fortune Global Forum’, Xi\ncalled for openness and innovation to\nenhance global economic growth, pledging\nto liberalize and facilitate trade and foreign\ninvestment in China.\n\nAnd at the “South-South Human Rights\nForum”, Xi emphasized that “human rights\nmust and can only be promoted in light of\nspecific national conditions and people’s\nneeds”.\n\nThe CPC's Dialogue with World Political\nParties was path-setting in that it put the\nworld on notice that a transformed CPC\nunder Xi is reaching out globally with pride\nand confidence — explaining, especially to\ndeveloping countries, the developmental\nbenefits of party leadership and party build-\ning. The point of debate, as it were, has\nshifted from whether the China model of a\nperpetually ruling party (with all that\nentails) is good for China to how the China\nmodel is good for other countries.\n\nAt a meeting of the Political Bureau of the\nCPC Central Committee, Xi directed author-\nities to improve digital infrastructure, pro-\nmote the integration and sharing of digital\nresources, and protect data security, in\norder to better serve the nation’s economic\nand social development as well as to\nimprove people's lives. The big vision is to\nturn China into a world leader in big data\nand a global innovation hub for artificial\nintelligence by 2030.\n\nThe last major event of the year was the\nannual Central Economic Work Conference,\nwhich identified “three tough battles” for\nthe next three years: preventing and defus-\ning risks (especially financial risks), elimi-\nnating absolute poverty (China’s 2020 goal),\nand curbing pollution (for instance, encour-\naging investment in environmental pro-\njects). Setting three-year targets was itself\nan innovation (over the traditional one-year\ntargets), thereby strengthening long-term\nthinking, reducing pressures to make hasty\ndecisions, and giving markets stable expec-\ntations.\n\nThe priority of reducing absolute debt\nwas modified to controlling a rise in bor-\nrowing, such that China’s debt-to-GDP ratio\ndoes not further deteriorate. This signaled\nthat growth would not be jeopardized and\n(to the disappointment of some) debt-driv-\nen growth would continue.\n\nTo contain financial risk, China will\ncrackdown on irregular and illegal activities\nin its chaotic financial industry and intensi-\nfy regulatory scrutiny; continue supply-side\nstructural reform (reducing overcapacities);\nand maintain a proactive fiscal policy, a\nprudent and neutral monetary policy, anda\nbasically stable yuan exchange rate.\n\nResisting arguments for shrinking State-\nowned enterprises, China will make SOEs\n“stronger, better and bigger”; and the gov-\nernment will seek efficiencies by becoming\nmore of an investor and less of an operator.\n\nChina pledged to open up its markets fur-\nther and to balance trade by boosting\nimports (US pressures, expressed vividly by\nTrump, were not mentioned).\n\nTheoretical foundation\n\nAfter five years of “practice”, the theoreti-\ncal foundation of China’s economic devel-\nopment is now labeled, “Xi Jinping\nThought on Socialist Economy with Chi-\nnese Characteristics for a New Era’, paral-\nleling the phrase added to the Party\nConstitution two months earlier. The\n“thought” is based mainly on Xi’s new con-\ncept of development — innovative, coordi-\nnated, green, open and shared development\n— which has been the core of his economic\nphilosophy.\n\nFor the first time at this annual confer-\nence, topics other than economics were on.\nthe agenda. Diverse public concerns were\naddressed, such as burdensome homework\nfor schoolchildren, sex discrimination in\nthe workplace, and online scams. This was a\nclear consequence of how China’s new\n“principal contradiction” in the “New Era”\nnow drives domestic policy; as Chinese citi-\nzens seek a “better life’; the government\nmust respond.\n\nTo pick one message to characterize the\nyear, it is this. In 2017, under the leadership\nof Xi, China set the trajectory, in all vital\nareas, of the country’s domestic develop-\nment and international engagement for the\nnext 30-plus years, to mid-century, to 2050.\n\nEvery year brings challenges. For China,\nno doubt, big ones lie ahead. In 2018, China\nwill celebrate the 40th anniversary of\nreform and opening-up. The world is\nwatching.\n\nThe author is a public intellectual, interna-\ntional corporate strategist and investment\nbanker, and China expert/commentator.

My classmates helped. They were\nincredibly generous in going through with me what I’d missed, and sharing their\nnotes, whenever I returned for an extended stint of reserve duty. P’ve seen\ninterviews with university friends saying I was one of the top students in our\nclass. But that is more generous than true. It would be fairer to say I was a good\nstudent. Working hard in the final year, I did finish in the upper quarter of the\nclass, and several of my math and science professors strongly urged me to go on\nto graduate school.\n\nBut my mind was made up on returning to the army. And as I balanced my\nstudies with plans for the future during my final months, | still hadn’t given up\nhope that Nili would be there with me. When she returned from Paris, we had\nstarted seeing each other again. Whenever I could, I would take the bus down to\nTel Aviv and spend the weekend with her. Everything I’d loved about her since\nthat first meeting in the Airya, everything I valued in our relationship, was still\nthere. Yet so, too, were the doubts: whether she was ready to commit herself to\nsharing our lives together; and whether a kibbutznik like me could ever truly fit\nin to her 7el Avivi world. Shortly before Karameh, she’d invited me to a Friday-\nnight party with a group of her friends. It was the first time she was including\nme, as part of a couple, in her social circle. But almost from the moment we got\nthere, I felt out of place. For her, it was just another party, one of dozens she\nmust have been to since she was a teenager. But I immediately felt out of place.\nI didn’t drink. I couldn’t dance. I couldn’t help feeling like a wallflower, or an\nalien presence.\n\nNow, I decided there was no point in waiting and wondering. I borrowed a\nJeep from an army friend, with the idea that Nili and I could spend three or four\ndays together, driving south from Jerusalem into the Negev and the Judean\ndesert: to be alone, to talk, to see whether we actually had a future. I wrote her a\nnote, took the bus to Tel Aviv while she was at work, and dropped it through the\nletterbox. “J am going on this trip, into the desert,” it said. “Id love it if you\ncould come with me. I think it’s important for us.”\n\nI never heard back. I felt crushed, though I tried hard to tell myself it was\nbetter to know where we stood. Years later, she told me the envelope had ended\n\n102\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027950\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I’ve spent hours talking to her about\nthe third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious. She has spent weeks at the bottom\nof the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away\nalmost anyone else’s I can think of—probably even Rupert Murdochs’. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for\nhours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is close friends.\n\nYet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party ofher best friend, Ariadne Calvo-Platero, (known\nfondly to her close friends as “the Tennis Goddess”) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes down to things she\nreally cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability.\n\nAnd that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey.\n\n“He saved her,” [remember a close friend of mine telling me. “When her father died, she was a wreck; inconsolable. And then\nJeffrey took her in. She’s never forgotten that—and never will.”\n\nIn many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect replacement for her\nfather, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine’s\nfather was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving a massive “black hole” he’d fraudulently created. To\nGhislaine, Jeffrey’s habits may not have seemed that strange.\n\nIn fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful people in the end\neither have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and moved countries to avoid\npaying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don’t tend to get to the top by being the world’s most\nbalanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn’t quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second\n“wife” for many years whose existence he has been open about.\n\nSo what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven’t spoken to her orto Jeffrey, but I suspect that her loyalty to friends\n\nlike Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she’ Il be out and about as always. Look at Waksal and Stewart. No one\nsees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire.

A significant portion of the visitor\nrevenue generated in the city is attributed to the gaming industry,\nwhich posted $9.6 billion in revenue in 2014.\n\nThe initial step in analyzing supply and demand trends within a given\ngaming market is to quantify the existing level of gaming inventory.\nTo quantify gaming supply levels, a review of all competitive gaming\nfacilities is performed. Once the market’s supply level is known, an\nanalysis of the demand for gaming facilities is performed.\n\nUnlike traditional economic models of supply and demand, the price variable associated with gaming is largely determined by the consumer.\nGaming is an intangible product: the consumer is purchasing the “experience” and “excitement” casino gaming offers. The price that the\nconsumer is willing to pay for this experience is known as the “win,” and is quantified on a per-unit basis known as the “win per unit per\nday” (WPUPD). Research indicates that the WPUPD, or the price a market can bear for gaming activity, is highly correlated to the level\nof available gaming inventory. The actual WPUPD attained by a market, say $100 per gaming position, and provides an indication of the\nmarketwide demand for gaming. As will be further discussed, these demand levels within a market can be estimated through an analysis of\nthe actual WPUPD attained by the market. Historical fluctuations in the marketwide WPUPD at various levels of supply can provide insight\ninto the future demand for gaming. Further impacting the demand for gaming facilities in the market are current and projected trends in\neconomic and demographic factors such as population base, employment, disposable income levels, and visitation statistics. In addition,\nseasonal fluctuations must be taken into consideration when analyzing demand trends.\n\nOnce the various demand trends have been identified, a variety of analytical methodologies may be employed to forecast gaming revenue\nfor an overall market or an individual property.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018785\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Her interests include the social\nshaping of psychological experience, and the\nway that social practice may affect even the most\nconcrete ways in which people experience their\nworld, particularly in the domain of what some\nwould call the “irrational”. Her first project was\na detailed study of the way apparently reasonable\npeople come to believe apparently unreasonable\nbeliefs (“Persuasions of the Witch’s Craft’,\nHarvard, 1989). Her second project explored the\napparently irrational self-criticism of a\npostcolonial India elite, the result of colonial\nidentification with the colonizers (“The Good\nParsi’, Harvard 1996). Her third book identified\ntwo cultures within the American profession of\npsychiatry and examined the way these different\ncultures encouraged two different forms of\nempathy and two different understandings of\nmental illness (“Of Two Minds”, Knopf, 2000).\nShe trained at the University of Cambridge (PhD\n1986), and taught for many years at the\nUniversity of California San Diego. Prior to\nmoving to Stanford she was the Max Palevsky\nProfessor and a director of the Clinical\nEthnography project in the Department of\nComparative Human Development at the\nUniversity of Chicago.\n\nReligion is often understood as a matter\nof belief: a yes/no proposition. This essay\nsuggests that it may be more helpful, and more\naccurate, to understand religious commitment as\na response to sensory experience that can be\nlearned, and that the capacity to learn depends\nupon one’s knowledge and belief, one’s\nproclivity for experiencing the world in\nparticular ways, and the impact of devotional\npractice.\n\nPage |111\n\ninvisible and immaterial, as God is\nwithin the Christian tradition? This is not\nthe question of whether God is real, but\nrather how people learn to make the\njudgment that God is present. Such a\nGod is not accessible to the senses.\nWhen you talk to that God, you can\nneither see his face nor hear his voice.\nYou cannot touch him. How can you be\nconfident that he is there?\n\nAnthropology cannot answer the\nquestion of whether God is real. But the\ntraditional method of the discipline,\nparticipant observation, can use the\nslow, careful method of fieldwork to\nexplore the way that people learn to\nexperience God as present in their lives.\nAnd what the method can teach us is that\nthis often intensely private and personal\nrelationship between a creature and its\ncreator is built through a profoundly\nsocial process.\n\nIn fact, one of anthropology’s\nmost useful contributions to\nunderstanding the experience of God is\nto draw attention to just how much work\nfaith takes, and to the fact that different\nkinds of faith—and different\nunderstandings of God—demand\ndifferent kinds of work. Many who do\nnot believe in God approach the question\nof religious belief as the problem of why\npeople should believe in the existence of\nan invisible, intentional agent in their\nworld. One of the more persuasive\nrecent answers emerges from the\nobservation that many of our cognitive\ntraits evolved to help us survive.\nEvolutionary anthropologists and\npsychologists argue that belief in\ninvisible beings is an accidental\nbyproduct of the way our minds have\nevolved over the millennia.

As a point of comparison, 27 of 100 books (27%) selected at random from an\nunfiltered corpus contained date-of-publication errors of greater than 5 years. The unfiltered corpus was\ncreated using a sampling strategy similar to that of Eng-1M. This selection mechanism favored recent\nbooks (which are more frequent) and pre-1800 books, which were excluded in the sampling strategy for\nfiltered books; as such the two numbers (6.2% and 27%) give a sense of the improvement, but are not\nstrictly comparable.\n\nNote that since the base corpora were generated (August 2009), many additional improvements have\nbeen made to the metadata dates used in Google Book Search itself. As such, these numbers do not\nreflect the accuracy of the Google Book Search online tool.\n\nII.1B. OCR quality\n\nThe challenge of performing accurate OCR on the entire books dataset is compounded by variations in\nsuch factors as language, font, size, legibility, and physical condition of the book. OCR quality was\nassessed using an algorithm developed by Popat et al. (Ref S3). This algorithm yields a probability that\nexpresses the confidence that a given sequence of text generated by OCR is correct. Incorrect or\nanomalous text can result from gross imperfections in the scanned images, or as a result of markings or\ndrawings. This algorithm uses sophisticated statistics, a variant of the Partial by Partial Matching (PPM)\nmodel, to compute for each glyph (character) the probability that it is anomalous given other nearby\nglyphs. (‘Nearby' refers to 2-dimensional distance on the original scanned image, hence glyphs above,\nbelow, to the left, and to the right of the target glyph.) The model parameters are tuned using multi-\nlanguage subcorpora, one in each of the 32 supported languages. From the per-glyph probability one can\ncompute an aggregate probability for a sequence of glyphs, including the entire text of a volume. In this\nmanner, every volume has associated with it a probabilistic OCR quality score (quantized to an integer\nbetween 0-100; note that the OCR quality score should not be confused with character or word accuracy).\nIn addition to error detection, the Popat model is also capable of computing the probability that the text is\nin a particular language given any sequence of characters. Thus the algorithm serves the dual purpose of\ndetecting anomalous text while simultaneously identifying the language in which the text is written.\n\nTo ensure the highest quality data, we excluded volumes with poor OCR quality. For the languages that\nuse a Latin alphabet (English, French, Spanish, and German), the OCR quality is generally higher, and\nmore books are available. As a result, we filtered out all volumes whose quality score was lower than\n80%. For Chinese and Russian, fewer books were available, and we did not apply the OCR filter. For\nHebrew, a 50% threshold was used, because its OCR quality was relatively better than Chinese or\nRussian. For geographically specific corpora, English US and English UK, a less stringent 60% threshold\nwas used, in order to maximize the number of books included (note that, as such, these two corpora are\nnot strict subsets of the broader English corpus). Figure S4 shows the distribution of OCR quality score\nas a function of the fraction of books in the English corpus. Use of an 80% cut off will remove the books\nwith the worst OCR, while retaining the vast majority of the books in the original corpus.\n\nThe OCR quality scores were also used as a /ocalized indicator of textual quality in order to remove\nanomalous sections of otherwise high-quality texts. The end source text was ensured to be of\ncomparable quality to the post-OCR text presented in \"text-mode\" on the Google Books website.\n\nII.1C. Accuracy of language metadata\n\nWe applied additional filters to remove books with dubious language-of-composition metadata. This filter\nremoved volumes whose meta-data language tag disagrees with the language determined by the\nstatistical language detection algorithm described in section 2A. For our English corpus, 8.56%\n\n6\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017014\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But pierce his\nair of mystery and the picture changes. Vicky Ward explores Epstein’s investment career, his ties\nto retail magnate Leslie Wexner, and his complicated past.\n\nby\n\ne Vicky Ward\n\nJune 27, 2011 12:00 am\n\nOn Manhattan’s Upper East Side, home to some of the most expensive real estate on earth, exists\nthe crown jewel of the city’s residential town houses. With its 15-foot-high oak door, huge\narched windows, and nine floors, it sits on—or, rather, commands—the block of 71st Street\nbetween Fifth and Madison Avenues. Almost ludicrously out of proportion with its four- and\nfive-story neighbors, it seems more like an institution than a house. This is perhaps not\nsurprising—until 1989 it was the Birch Wathen private school. Now it is said to be Manhattan’s\nlargest private residence.\n\nInside, amid the flurry of menservants attired in sober black suits and pristine white gloves, you\nfeel you have stumbled into someone’s private Xanadu. This is no mere rich person’s home, but\na high-walled, eclectic, imperious fantasy that seems to have no boundaries.\n\nThe entrance hall is decorated not with paintings but with row upon row of individually framed\neyeballs; these, the owner tells people with relish, were imported from England, where they were\nmade for injured soldiers. Next comes a marble foyer, which does have a painting, in the manner\nof Jean Dubuffet ... but the host coyly refuses to tell visitors who painted it. In any case, guests\nare like pygmies next to the nearby twice-life-size sculpture of a naked African warrior.\n\nDespite its eccentricity the house is curiously impersonal, the statement of someone who wants\nto be known for the scale of his possessions. Its occupant, financier Jeffrey Epstein, 50, admits to\nfriends that he likes it when people think of him this way. A good-looking man, resembling\nRalph Lauren, with thick gray-white hair and a weathered face, he usually dresses in jeans, knit\nshirts, and loafers. He tells people he bought the house because he knew he “could never live\nanywhere bigger.” He thinks 51,000 square feet is an appropriately large space for someone like\nhimself, who deals mostly in large concepts—especially large sums of money.\n\nGuests are invited to lunch or dinner at the town house—Epstein usually refers to the former as\n“tea,” since he likes to eat bite-size morsels and drink copious quantities of Earl Grey. (He does\nnot touch alcohol or tobacco.) Tea is served in the “leather room,” so called because of the\n\ncordovan-colored fabric on the walls. The chairs are covered in a leopard print, and on the wall\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017772\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Also, plenty of S&M terms are super useful, and giving a quick\noverview of S&M language can go a long way towards describing S&M culture. Hence, I\nhave included a Glossary at the end of this book. Many of the terms in the Glossary aren't\nterms that I use in this book, but you might find it useful or interesting anyway. (I also\nincluded a few terms that come from other subcultures, such as polyamory or queer\nstudies.)\n\nI've received a lot of feedback over the years informing me that I'm the \"gateway drug”\ninto feminism for some readers. That's kind of cool, but I want to make it clear that if\nyou're just now getting into feminism, there's lots of other stuff to learn before you draw\nany conclusions. Feminism is a huge, varied, rich movement with lots of history, schisms,\nand discontents. Also, in case it needs to be said, I'm not the only feminist who does\nS&M. There are others, some of whom love my work and some of whom disagree with\nme frequently.\n\nOne advantage of the blog format, as opposed to more traditional formats, is that each\npost can contain tons of hyperlinks -- and each article has comment space, so there can be\nfascinating discussions that explore each topic more deeply. (Of course, there can also be\nsilly, boring, or offensive discussions.) As soon as a blog becomes moderately successful,\nit develops its own community of regular commenters, and mine is no exception.\nFacilitating and moderating these discussions can be amazingly fun and interesting. It can\nalso be stressful and exhausting. As a commenter community evolves, it shapes how\nother people read the blog's articles and comment on them; sometimes the community\nwill develop norms or tendencies that make certain people feel more comfortable -- or\nless comfortable. I've tried to control this with my blog so that it's a welcoming\nenvironment for most people, but I have such a diverse range of commenters that it's\nsometimes quite difficult.\n\nI bring all this up because, if you're intrigued by some of the articles you read in this\nbook, I encourage you to check out the original post. In this book, I've made a lot of\nhyperlinks into footnotes, but not all of them. More importantly, if you look at the\noriginal post, you can read the comments. But my commenter community has changed\nover time. Sometimes it's more feminist, for example, and sometimes it's less feminist. So\njust be aware, if you read the comments, that the range of opinions may not reflect any\ngroup that would assemble elsewhere on the planet; that a different community might\nproduce really different comments; and that other articles might have really different\ndiscussions.\n\nYou can buy this book in paperback form at CreateSpace:\n\nhttps://www.createspace.com/3878670\n\nIf you've already read my incredibly awesome book Confessions of a Pickup Artist\nChaser, then thank you!

For\ncorporations, the offense level is modified by factors par-\nticular to organizations as described in Chapter 8 to deter-\nmine the applicable organizational penalty.\n\nFor example, violations of the anti-bribery provi-\nsions are calculated pursuant to § 2C1.1. The offense level\nis determined by first identifying the base offense level;\nadding additional levels based on specific offense charac-\nteristics, including whether the offense involved more than\none bribe, the value of the bribe or the benefit that was con-\nferred, and the level of the public official;®° adjusting the\noffense level based on the defendant's role in the offense;*!\nand using the total offense level as well as the defendant’s\ncriminal history category to determine the advisory guide-\nline range.*” For violations of the accounting provisions\nassessed under § 2B1.1, the procedure is generally the\nsame, except that the specific offense characteristics differ.\nFor instance, for violations of the FCPA’s accounting pro-\nvisions, the offense level may be increased if a substantial\npart of the scheme occurred outside the United States or if\nthe defendant was an officer or director of a publicly traded\ncompany at the time of the offense.??\n\nFor companies, the offense level is calculated pur-\nsuant to §§ 2C1.1 or 2B1.1 in the same way as for an\nindividual—by starting with the base offense level and\nincreasing it as warranted by any applicable specific\noffense characteristics. The organizational guidelines\nfound in Chapter 8, however, provide the structure for\ndetermining the final advisory guideline fine range for\norganizations. The base fine consists of the greater of the\namount corresponding to the total offense level, calcu-\nlated pursuant to the Guidelines, or the pecuniary gain or\nloss from the offense.>** This base fine is then multiplied\nby a culpability score that can either reduce the fine to as\nlittle as five percent of the base fine or increase the recom-\nmended fine to up to four times the amount of the base\nfine.’ As described in § 8C2.5, this culpability score is\ncalculated by taking into account numerous factors such\n\nas the size of the organization committing the criminal\n\nacts; the involvement in or tolerance of criminal activ-\nity by high-level personnel within the organization; and\nprior misconduct or obstructive behavior. The culpability\nscore is reduced if the organization had an effective pre-\nexisting compliance program to prevent violations and if\nthe organization voluntarily disclosed the offense, cooper-\nated in the investigation, and accepted responsibility for\n\nthe criminal conduct.?*°\n\nCivil Penalties\n\nAlthough only DOJ has the authority to pursue crim-\ninal actions, both DOJ and SEC have civil enforcement\nauthority under the FCPA. DOJ may pursue civil actions\nfor anti-bribery violations by domestic concerns (and their\nofficers, directors, employees, agents, or stockholders) and\nforeign nationals and companies for violations while in the\nUnited States, while SEC may pursue civil actions against\nissuers and their officers, directors, employees, agents, or\nstockholders for violations of the anti-bribery and the\naccounting provisions.**”\n\nFor violations of the anti-bribery provisions, cor-\nporations and other business entities are subject to a civil\npenalty of up to $16,000 per violation.>* Individuals,\nincluding officers, directors, stockholders, and agents of\ncompanies, are similarly subject to a civil penalty of up to\n$16,000 per violation,**? which may not be paid by their\nemployer or principal3®\n\nFor violations of the accounting provisions, SEC may\nobtain a civil penalty not to exceed the greater of (a) the\ngross amount of the pecuniary gain to the defendant as a\nresult of the violations or (b) a specified dollar limitation.\nThe specified dollar limitations are based on the egregious-\nness of the violation, ranging from $7,500 to $150,000 for\nan individual and $75,000 to $725,000 for a company.*\nSEC may obtain civil penalties both in actions filed in fed-\n\neral court and in administrative proceedings3”\n\nCollateral Consequences\nIn addition to the criminal and civil penalties described\nabove, individuals and companies who violate the FCPA may\n\nface significant collateral consequences, including suspension\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022571\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We are not making mass changes today. While\nsome of our trades have worked better than others post-election we are broadly happy\nwith the balance. We still want exposure to growth and to own yield where we can but\nalso want to protect ourselves from a further surge in the USD and rates.\n\nWe diversify our equity long in EM and European yield with a long Nikkei position.\nIt is not the best entry point but we suspect it has further to run on a one year horizon.\nA stronger USD is good for Japanese equities where it is not for EM, so they\ncomplement one another. We add a short US 10Y real rate trade too to protect\nagainst rising US yields, as breakevens have already moved significantly. We close our\nKospi vol trade (changed view from strategists) and drop the short Food leg of our\nPharma/Food trade, reflecting the sharp sell-off in the long duration sectors of late.\n\nSummary: Still be long growth and yield but hedge with USD and Rates\n\nYear aheads are notoriously tricky to write and almost always wrong. Anyone who\nwanted to correctly predict the outcomes and how markets would react to them in 2016\ndid not need so much as crystal ball as a time machine. As investors and strategists we\nhave to make calculations as to the most likely outcomes, where is the best upside to\nplay them and how best to hedge the risks around them.\n\nDonald Trump’s election is in our view an inflection point for global markets,\nstarting new trends in some asset classes and extending trends in others. It does\nnot completely change the world though, as the disinflationary and weak growth\npressures that have plagued the world since the GFC are structural rather than cyclical.\nBut the shift to fiscal and populism is likely to boost growth and inflation, so it does\nchange the picture to a significant degree. If we are to call it an earthquake it is perhaps\na five rather than a nine on the Richter scale.\n\nWe have to adjust our way of thinking though. The rise in rates and higher USD that\nwe had hedged against now look like they are going to go further. That is going to\nhurt longer duration assets. So we continue to run our long USD positions and add to\nour short rate positions (via 10Y real rates). There is risk around trade and geopolitics,\nwhich has to make us more nervous of our EM positions. So we diversify our risks by\npairing our long EM position with a long Japan position and add a CNH put.\n\nBut the world is not completely changing. Even in the new order we only forecast 10Y\nTreasuries at 2.65% and Bund yields at 65bp end 2017. So the hunt for yield will not\ndisappear completely. We still want to own yield, but as we have said of late it cannot\nbe yield for yield’s sake. Yield in equity markets has been safest in the shortest duration\nbuckets, such as Banks and Cyclicals since the summer. We changed our yield basket last\nmonth is this direction so we keep it. We stay long AT1’s and in credit we keep our\nspread trades both in Europe and the US.\n\nAND we remind investors of something we said at the start of 2016, be prepared\nto trade the ranges in markets. If there was one lesson of the last year it was that.\nWhen assets get very loved and overbought, sell them, when it is the opposite you have\nto buy them. Think of buying EM and commodities in February. Think of selling\ndefensive equities and bonds and buying banks post-Brexit. None of us will get that\nright all of the time, but the Warren Buffet maxim “be greedy when others are fearful\nand fearful when others are greedy” is particularly useful in current markets.\n\nFinally, as cross asset investors think about what can go wrong with your positions\nand find asymmetric hedges for them if you can. That should be the edge you have at\nlooking across the range of asset classes compared to single asset class investors.\n\nWe would like to thank our BofAML colleagues who have supported our product this\nyear by providing many such ideas and trust they will continue to do so through 2017.\n\nBankof America 2 Global Cross Asset Strategy - Year Ahead | 30 November 2016 3\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014434\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We wish we could say that about the international community. So long as Mr. Assad escapes strong condemnation and real punishment, he will keep turning his tanks and troops on his people. \n\nHuman rights groups believe that more than 1,000 protesters have been killed in a three-month crackdown and that 10,000 more have been arrested. Hamza Ali al-Khateeb, the 13-year-old boy whose tortured body was shown in an online video, has become a heartbreaking symbol of the regime’s brutality. According to activists, he was arrested at a protest on April 29 and not seen again until his broken body was delivered to his family almost a month later. \n\nHis murder and that of at least 30 other children who joined the protests show the depths to which Mr. Assad and his thugs have sunk. \n\nOn Friday, in some of the biggest demonstrations yet, thousands of people again returned to the streets to demand political freedoms. Activists said dozens of protesters were killed in Hama after troops and regime loyalists opened fire. Independent journalists are barred from the country, so the full extent of the violence is unclear. What we do know is that the Syrian government has unleashed a wave of repression, perhaps the most vicious counterattack of the Arab spring. \n\nAfter the killing began, the United States and Europe imposed sanctions — mostly travel bans and asset freezes — on certain key regime officials while exempting Mr. Assad. Only later did they add his name to the list. The rhetoric is stiffening. On Thursday Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton declared that Mr. Assad’s legitimacy is “if not gone, nearly run out.” But some American and European officials still buy the fantasy that Mr. Assad could yet implement reforms. \n\nMost appalling, the United Nations Security Council is unable to muster the votes to condemn the bloodshed much less impose sanctions. Russia, cynically protecting longstanding ties with Damascus, is blocking meaningful action and China has fallen in lockstep. India is also reluctant to act — a shameful stance for a democracy that has been bidding for a permanent seat on the Council. \n\nIf Russia and China, which have veto power, can’t be won over, the United States and Europe must push a robust sanctions resolution and dare Moscow and the others to side with Mr. Assad over the Syrian people. \n\nWe do not know how this will turn out. But arguments that Mr. Assad is the best guarantor of stability and the best way to avoid extremism have lost all credibility. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 2.\n\nThe Washington Post\n\nEgypt’s revolutionary justice\n\nEditorial\n\n\n\nJune 4 -- LET’S STIPULATE: There are very likely good grounds to prosecute deposed Egyptian ruler Hosni Mubarak. In nearly 30 years in power, the strongman appears to have amassed a considerable fortune, including the luxurious beach estate to which he retreated after his overthrow. More than 800 people were killed during the 18-day revolution, and prosectors allege that Mr. Mubarak approved plans to use force against peaceful demonstrators.\n\nThe decision by Egypt’s ruling military council and state prosecutors to begin a trial of the former strongman on Aug. 3 — before the country holds its first democratic elections — is nevertheless a mistake, one that could push Egypt off the path to establishing a stable democracy and reviving its economy. Mr. Mubarak, who is 83 and in failing health, is not entitled to impunity; nor are his family and former ministers. But the approach of the interim regime, which has jailed dozens of former officials and two of Mr. Mubarak’s sons, is deeply flawed.  The trouble starts with the speed and timing of the prosecutions. Anxious to prevent further mass protests, the interim military council has appeared to time steps against the former regime just ahead of threatened demonstrations. The announcement that Mr. Mubarak would be put on trial came May 24, three days ahead of a planned opposition gathering in Cairo’s Tahrir Square. Three of Mr. Mubarak’s former ministers have already been convicted of crimes, and other trials are moving forward quickly. There are serious questions about the evidence in at least one — a case brought against the energy minister and five associates over alleged fraud in gas sales to Israel.  The legal system handling these cases, oddly, is that of Mr. Mubarak — and was justly renowned under his tenure for its lack of independence and its politicized rulings. There’s good reason for concern that former members of the regime are now victims of that politicization. The judge hearing a murder case against former interior minister Habib el-Adly, for example, was involved in one-sided rulings against political dissidents during Mr. Mubarak’s reign. That’s particularly worrisome because Mr. Adly has become the focus of populist calls for retribution, with some opposition sloganeers demanding that he be hanged.\n\nEgypt cannot bury a half century of authoritarianism; there must be a reckoning. But the right authority to oversee it is not a temporary military authority attempting to keep crowds out of the streets, but a democratically elected government. Investigations and trials must be conducted by prosecutors and judges who are neutral, professional and untainted by the previous regime. One leading Egyptian human rights activist, Hossam Bahgat, has suggested that Egypt follow the example of other countries emerging from dictatorship and establish a formal process of investigation and exposure of past crimes — a process that could include reparations for victims and prosecution of the most significant cases. Such an initiative could help to bolster a new democratic order in Egypt, but the rush to judgment now underway could seriously undermine it.  \n\fArticle 3.\n\nAl-Ahram Weekly\n\nEgypt: In search of a foreign policy\n\nMohamed Anis Salem \n\n\n\n2 - 8 June 2011 -- Sooner or later, the question of reviewing Egypt's foreign policy was going to crop up. In the early days of Tahrir, observers noted that the uprising did not occupy itself with international affairs. When Israel voiced concerns about the future of its relations with Cairo, Egypt's Higher Council of the Armed Forces (HCAF) reaffirmed the country's commitment to all international agreements, inter alia the Egyptian- Israeli Peace Treaty. Later, criticism of the two Egyptian governments formed after the revolution (one led by Ahmed Shafik, the next by Essam Sharaf) focussed, amongst other things, on retaining a number of the ancien regime ministers in office, including foreign minister Ahmed Abul-Gheit. Abul-Gheit had irritated his critics -- some would say the general public as well -- by his statements on the Egyptian uprising, as well as his earlier positions on Palestinians crossing over from Gaza into Egypt, Hamas and Iran. His replacement, Nabil El-Arabi, a seasoned diplomat with legal expertise, positioned himself as part of Egypt's new outlook to the world. He signalled that relations with Iran would be upgraded, Gaza's Rafah Crossings would be opened, and relations with Israel would be managed on a tit-for-tat basis. If the peace treaty with Israel required revision, there were clauses that allowed for that. Egypt would join the Rome Statute (the legal basis of the International Criminal Court) and other human rights instruments.   The Iranian aspect did not rest there. While Tehran responded positively, several Arab countries in the Gulf, already in bitter confrontation with Iran over Bahrain, felt that the new minister's timing was off. In Cairo, experts supported an opening with Iran, as it would allow Egyptian diplomacy to exercise more influence over issues like the Arab-Israeli conflict, Lebanon, Gulf security and establishing a regional nuclear free zone. But, at the same time, several voices expressed concern at the style of handling this issue. It seemed that no prior coordination or consultation was undertaken with Gulf countries. Why now? Was this a response to discreet Gulf suggestions that ex-president Hosni Mubarak should be treated more leniently? In a hastily arranged Gulf trip, Prime Minister Sharaf reassured his hosts that \"Gulf security was a red line for Egypt\" and that the opening with Tehran would not be at the expense of relations with Gulf Arabs. But these reassurances seemed to have limited effect as the Gulf Cooperation Council moved to expand its membership to include Jordan and Morocco. The new regional order aligned Arab royal regimes in a cluster that left out countries experiencing uprisings (Egypt, Libya, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen) or facing instability (Iraq, Somalia and Sudan) or extreme poverty (Djibouti and Mauritania) -- hardly a winning hand.\n\nEnter the Palestinian issue. The previous year had not ended well for the Palestinians. While Israel continued with its settlement policy, the mediation efforts of the US administration were going nowhere. The bid to reconcile Fatah and Hamas had failed and tensions were high between Hamas and Cairo. Then, suddenly, Egypt closed a reconciliation agreement between the Palestinians. The Israeli prime minister reacted negatively. The US was worried, insisting that Hamas needed to recognise Israel before being admitted as a partner. But Europe, more wisely, saw the agreement as a positive development. Then Egypt announced it was opening the Rafah Crossing; it would have nothing to do anymore with the siege of Gaza. Taken together, these signals were received enthusiastically by Egypt's revolutionary youth, intellectuals, media and political movements (mostly, perhaps, by the Muslim Brothers) as a sign of a more independent foreign policy. But life is complicated. Arab League Secretary- General Amr Moussa was leaving his post to contest the Egyptian presidency. After some hesitation, Egypt withdrew its initial candidate for the Arab League position and forwarded the name of a prominent politician, Mustafa El-Feki. When this nomination stumbled in the face of Qatari competition, it was replaced with Egypt's newly appointed foreign minister who was given the job by consensus. Which brings us full circle to the foreign policy questions presently being debated: What are the tenets of Egypt's new foreign policy? What should the objectives be? What strategies should be deployed? What is the job description for the new foreign minister? \n\nTHE NEW FRAME OF REFERENCE: For some 60 years, Egypt presented its foreign policy with reference to three circles: Arab, African and Islamic. The prolonged focus on the confrontation with Israel, and the bipolar international order helped set priorities and select strategies. In reality, Egyptian policy functioned with flexibility, embracing neutrality from the 1940s onwards while, at the same time, moving from quasi alliance with the USSR in the 1960s to a very close relationship with the US since the 1980s. The three circles were always anachronistic and limited intellectually; they did not elaborate on Egypt's priorities, nor did they explain how they would be pursued in a complex world. Moreover, the goalposts were moved with the collapse of the USSR, the Arab-Israeli peace agreements, and the withering of the Non-Aligned Movement. On top of that, over the last few months, the regional landscape has been changed dramatically -- particularly in the way it informs foreign policy. The multiple Arab uprisings emphasised democracy, human rights and participation. Egypt, now a model for change, felt the need to formulate a policy towards the tsunami wave of change hitting the region. So far, its foreign minister has considered popular uprisings in the region to be an internal matter for concerned countries. Indeed, he told the BBC that the \"official position on this question was: no comment!\"      In the case of Libya, Egypt's position was explained in terms of ensuring the safety and livelihood of the large number of its citizens working there. But some analysts, like Mohamed Hassanein Heikal, were critical of the licence the Arab League gave NATO to intervene in Libya. Could not the Arabs have issued a stern warning to Gaddafi to abdicate? Shouldn't Egypt have played a more assertive role in directing events in this next-door neighbour? Why has the Arab League fallen silent since the Western intervention in Libya? How shrewd was it to send an Egyptian delegation to Muammar Gaddafi as late as May, without visiting the rebels?\n\nTo the south, another set of forces demand Egypt's attention: ensuring the continued flow of the Nile waters, responding to Sudan's fragmentation, and reducing the fallout from the chaos at the southern entrance of the Red Sea. While Egypt's newly energised political and civil society leaders launched \"popular diplomacy\" visits to Ethiopia and Uganda, it is clear that resolving contested issues will need more than such ice-breakers. Also on the southern front, the Egyptian navy has remained aloof from the 25-nation Combined Maritime Forces focussed on Somali pirates, themselves an offshoot of a neglected 20-year conflict. Egypt's foreign minister announced that his country wanted to achieve a full-fledged Arab-Israeli peace, not perpetuate the peace process. While the inter- Palestinian reconciliation was a first step in this direction, and a movement is underway to gain UN recognition for a Palestinian state, the reality is that stagnation looms ahead, at least for the next 18 months when the US presidential elections are behind us. What are the options during this period? In the Egyptian-Israeli context, it might be possible to open negotiations on improving access to Gaza, strengthening security arrangements in Sinai, and updating the price of Egyptian gas exports. If the Syria situation calms down (a big \"if\"), then Damascus may be interested in energising its own peace negotiations, as suggested recently by former US government adviser Bill Quant. Indeed, this possibility partially explains the gentler US treatment of Bashar Al-Assad in the face of a popular uprising. But there remains obscurity over how to deal with Binyamin Netanyahu's obstructionism, recently described by Thomas Friedman as the \"Mubarak of the peace process\". \n\nMeanwhile, non-Arab states of the Middle East have created a brand of diplomacy where ideas are energetically pursued with a variety of hard and soft power strategies. Both Turkey and Iran, in different ways, have increased the level of their interaction and influence in the region. The former established visa free travel zones with several Arab countries, expanded its Middle East trade relations and interceded on issues ranging from Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations, to mediating on Iran's nuclear programme and the Libyan situation. The stars of Turkish soap operas are household names in the region. Iran, albeit under a cloud due to internal repression and the refusal of Arab uprisings of Tehran's patronage, still has huge influence in Iraq, an alliance with Syria, Hizbullah and Hamas, and a nuclear programme that attracts popular admiration to the extent it appears to respond to Israel's atomic monopoly. A more dynamic Egyptian diplomacy will be measured against these standards.  IT'S THE ECONOMY: Beyond this challenging landscape, Egypt's reaction to the new regional dynamics will be heavily conditioned by two critical factors: the economy and internal politics. Facing a serious downturn of revenues from tourism, a slackening of investment inflows and disrupted industrial production, IMF experts estimate that Egypt will need up to $12 billion over the next financial year in external assistance. The critical partners that have the capacity to respond to this requirement are the US, the EU and Gulf countries. At their recent summit at Deauville, the G8 pledged a combination of debt relief, aid and assistance to Egypt and Tunisia to help build their democracies. Earlier, speaking at Oxford, Qatari Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassem revived the idea of establishing a Middle East Development Bank to address \"the lack of economic diversity, added to the high rate of unemployment among the youth sector\". Cairo will need to ensure close, productive relations with this group of countries. The second factor will be the growing influence of internal politics on the foreign policy production process. For the past six decades, Egypt's foreign policy was designed and implemented through a closed system largely controlled by the president of the day and the elitist foreign affairs machinery. Gradually, after 25 January, a wider foreign policy debate has unfolded with inputs from political parties, independent experts, research centres and media, as demonstrated at the recent National Dialogue Conference in Cairo. In the near future, many predict that bodies like the proposed National Security Council, parliamentary foreign relations committees, and the Council of Ministers will institutionalise this role. Politically, the two currents of Islam and liberal democracy will come to bear on this debate. The danger here is that the growth of populist postures will impinge on a policy guided by principles and national interest.\n\nIn recent policy debates in Cairo, innovative ideas were in short supply as nostalgia prevailed. There was talk about the villa on Hishmet Street in Zamalek from where Nasser's Egypt supported African liberation movements and leaders. Some participants proposed reverting to older policies and instruments: refusing foreign economic assistance, activating Egypt's Nasr Export and Import Company in Africa and moving Egyptian farmers to Sudan. And yet, what is most needed at the moment is a new reading of tectonic changes in the region and internationally.  For example, in the African context, Egypt needs to consider the new players on the field and the scale of their operations. Here, there has been a rapid growth of interaction with Asian powers. Currently, the volume of China's trade with Africa is over $125 billion annually, while trade between India and Africa has jumped from $1 billion in 2001 to almost $50 billion last year. India is the largest foreign investor in Ethiopia (with $4.78 billion invested last year) and its annual volume of trade with Addis Ababa is $272 million. At the recent India-Africa summit, India's prime minister pledged $5 billion over the next three years to support African countries in reaching the Millennium Development Goals, in addition to $700 million for developing institutions and another $300 million to building a Djibouti- Ethiopian railway. India also offered 22,000 higher education scholarships and funding for the African Union mission in Somalia (AMISOM). Meanwhile, South Africa has joined the BRIC grouping of Brazil, Russia, India and China. Such developments have changed the terrain and the possibilities for Egypt's movement in Africa, demanding closer engagement, innovation, and sustained effort. \n\nThe job description, and the ongoing head hunting, for Egypt's next minister of foreign affairs will need to take these factors into consideration, with emphasis on the ability to develop a new vision for the country's foreign policy. As French novelist Marcel Proust once said, \"The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes.\" Perhaps this, more than anything else, is what Egyptian diplomacy needs at the moment.\n\n\n\nThe writer is director of Development Works (www.dev-works.org) and coordinator of the UN Working Group in the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs. \n\n\n\n\n\fArticle 4.\n\nForeign Policy\n\nDo the American people support the 'special relationship?'\n\nStephen M. Walt \n\n\n\nJune 3, 2011  -- A couple of weeks ago, Americans were treated to a remarkably clear demonstration of the power of the Israel lobby in the United States. First, Barack Obama gave a speech on Middle East policy at the State Department, which tried to position America as a supporter of the Arab spring and reiterated his belief that a two-state solution is the best way to resolve the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The next day, he met with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, who rejected several of Obama's assertions and lectured him about what \"Israel expects\" from its great power patron. Then Obama felt it was smart politics to go to AIPAC and clarify his remarks. It was a pretty good speech, but Obama didn't offer any ideas for how his vision of Middle East peace might be realized and he certainly never suggested that -- horrors! -- the United States might use its considerable leverage to push both sides to an agreement. And then Netanyahu received a hero's welcome up on Capitol Hill, getting twenty-nine standing ovations for a defiant speech that made it clear that the only \"two-state\" solution he's willing to contemplate is one where the Palestinians live in disconnected Bantustans under near-total Israeli control. \n\nNot surprisingly, this display of the lobby's influence made plenty of people uncomfortable, and some of them -- such as M.J. Rosenberg at Media Matters offered up some personal tales of their own run-ins with Israel's hardline backers. In response to Rosenberg's sally (and the hoopla surrounding the Netanyahu visit), Jonathan Chait of The New Republic has fallen back on a familiar line of defense. After conceding that there is a lobby and that it does have a lot of influence, he argued that \"the most important basis of American support for Israel is not the lobby but the public's overwhelming sympathy for Israel.\" In other words, AIPAC et al don't really matter that much, and all those standing ovations on Capitol Hill were really just a genuine reflection of public opinion. He also said that John Mearsheimer and I believe the lobby exerts \"total control\" over U.S. foreign policy, and that we claim groups in the lobby were solely responsible for the invasion of Iraq. \n\nTo deal with the last claim first, this straw-man depiction of our argument merely confirms once again that Chait has not in fact read our book. I don't find that surprising, because a careful reading of the book would reveal to him that we weren't anti-Israel or anti-Semitic, had made none of the claims he accuses us of, and had in fact amassed considerable evidence to support the far more nuanced arguments that we did advance. And then he'd have to ponder the fact that virtually everything The New Republic has ever published about us was bogus. So I can easily see why he prefers to repeat the same falsehoods and leave it at that. \n\nBut what of his more basic claim that the \"special relationship\" between the United States and Israel is really a reflection of \"the public's overwhelming sympathy?\" There are at least three big problems with this assertion. \n\nFirst, even if it were true that the public had \"overwhelming sympathy\" for Israel, it does not immediately follow that United States policy would necessarily follow suit. U.S. officials frequently do things that a majority of Americans oppose, if they believe that doing so is in the U.S. interest. A majority of Americans oppose fighting on in Afghanistan, for example, yet the Obama administration chose to escalate that war instead. Similarly, numerous polls show that the American people favor the \"public option\" in health care, but that's not exactly the policy that health care reform produced. Public opinion is an important factor, of course, but what public officials decide to do almost always reflects a more complex weighting of political factors (including the intensity of public preferences, broader strategic considerations, the weight of organized interests, etc.) \n\nSecond, to the extent that the American public does have a favorable image of Israel -- and there's no question that it does -- that is at least partly due to the lobby's own efforts to shape public discourse and stifle negative commentary. The lobby doesn't \"control the media,\" but \"pro-Israel\" groups like the ADL and CAMERA work actively to influence how Israel is portrayed in the United States, aided by reliably supportive publications like The New Republic. (As its former editor-in-chief Marty Peretz once admitted, \"there's a sort of party line on Israel\" at the journal). That's their privilege, of course, but groups and individuals in the lobby have also tried to silence or smear virtually any one who criticizes the \"special relationship,\" and all-too-often those efforts succeed (if perhaps less frequently than they used to). If Americans were exposed to a more open discourse -- such as the discourse that prevails in Europe or in Israel itself -- Israel's favorable image would almost certainly decrease (though by no means disappear). \n\nThird, and most important, the evidence suggests that the American people are not in favor of a one-sided \"special relationship\" where Israel gets unconditional American backing no matter what it does. Although there is no question that Americans have a generally favorable image of Israel and want the United States to help it survive and prosper, they are not demanding that U.S. politicians back it to the hilt or show the kind of craven adulation that Congress displayed last week. \n\nFor starters, many Americans recognize that one-sided support for Israel is a problem for the United States, and that figure is even higher among \"opinion leaders.\" A Pew survey in November 2005 found that 39 percent of Americans saw the special relationship as a \"major source of global discontent,\" and 78 percent of the news media, 72 percent of military leaders and 69 percent of foreign affairs specialists believed that backing Israel seriously damages America's image around the world. A 2003 survey by the University of Maryland reported that over 60 percent of Americans would be willing to withhold aid to Israel if it resisted pressure to settle the conflict with the Palestinians, and 73 percent said the United States should not favor either side. In fact, a survey conducted by the Anti-Defamation League in 2005 found that 78 percent of Americans believed that Washington should favor neither Israel nor the Palestinians. A 2010 survey by the Brookings Institution found similar results: although 25 percent of Americans thought the United States should \"lean toward Israel\" in its efforts to resolve the conflict, a healthy 67 percent believed the United States should \"lean toward neither side.\" \n\nNeedless to say, such figures are hard to square with the robotic enthusiasm displayed by Congress, or with the Obama administration's timid approach to entire problem. But the behavior of both the executive and legislative branches are entirely consistent with the normal workings of interest group politics in the United States. In a democracy where freedom of association and speech are guaranteed, and where elections are expensive to run and where campaign contributions are weakly regulated, even relatively small groups can exercise considerable influence if they are strongly committed to a particular issue and the rest of the population does not care that much. \n\nWhether the issue is farm subsidies or foreign policy, in short, special interest groups often wield disproportionate political power. Because countervailing forces are much weaker (as is the case when it comes to Middle East policy), groups like AIPAC and others have the field to themselves. Consider that in the 2010 election, \"pro-Israel\" PACs gave about $3 million to candidates from both parties. By comparison, Arab-American PACs gave less than $50,000. You can buy a lot of applause when the balance is stacked that way. \n\nWhen you combine these facts with the sometimes thuggish tactics used against people who don't subscribe to the party line on this issue, you have a situation where politicians and appointed officials will bend over backwards to support the special relationship (or just remain silent), even when they know it's not good for the United States or Israel and when most Americans (including plenty of American Jews) would support a more normal relationship. In short, a relationship that would be healthier for the United States and Israel alike. \n\nAnd the saddest part, as I've noted repeatedly, is that some people who care deeply about Israel and who see themselves as loyal defenders are the ones who are enabling its own self-defeating intransigence and threatening its future. Chait is a smart and well-informed guy, and his views on many subjects are thoughtful and nuanced. Which makes his failure to face the facts on this issue all the more surprising ... and regrettable. \n\n\n\nStephen M. Walt is the Robert and Renée Belfer professor of international relations at Harvard University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\fArticle 5.\n\nYale Center for the Study of Globalization\n\nThe Battle for Pakistan\n\nBruce Riedel\n\n\n\nJune 3, 2011 -- The struggle for control of Pakistan - soon to be the fifth most populous country in the world with the fifth largest nuclear arsenal - intensifies every day. The outcome is far from certain. The key player, Pakistan's army, seems dangerously ambivalent about which side should prevail: the jihadist Frankenstein it created or the democratically elected civilian government it despises.\n\nThe American commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden on May 2nd accelerated the struggle underway inside Pakistan to determine the country's future. Contrary to some assessments, Pakistan is neither a failed state nor a failing state. It functions as effectively today as in decades past. Rather it is a state under siege from a radical syndicate of terror groups loosely aligned together with the goal of creating an extremist jihadist state in south Asia. They want to hijack Pakistan and its weapons. Less than a hundred hours after the Abbottabad raid, Al Qaeda's shura council, its command centre, announced the group was declaring war on Pakistan and the \"traitors and thieves\" in the government who had betrayed the \"martyr shaykh\" bin Laden to the Americans. It was ironic since many Americans suspect the Pakistani army was actually complicit in abetting bin Laden's successful evasion of the largest manhunt in human history for 10 years. That both Al Qaeda and America distrust the Pakistani army speaks volumes. Since then Al Qaeda and its allies in Pakistan have carried out their threat with a vengeance. Suicide bombings and other terror attacks have occurred across the country. The worst was an attack on a major Pakistani navy base in Karachi, a heavily guarded facility where both US and Chinese experts assist the navy. Two US-made P3 surveillance aircraft were destroyed in the attack. The assailants had insider knowledge of the base, and Pakistani security has arrested former naval personnel accused of helping the attackers.  The Karachi attack illustrates the essence of the battle for Pakistan today. The militants support Al Qaeda, but were members of its ally the Pakistani Taliban. Their goal was to humiliate the navy. The navy fought back, but is riddled with jihadist sympathizers who help the militants.  A Pakistani journalist, Syed Salman Shahzad, wrote an expose after the attack of the jihadist penetration of the military, especially the navy. He received threatening calls from the military's intelligence service, the notorious Inter Services Intelligence directorate, telling him to stop reporting on the issue, and was murdered shortly afterward. The Pakistani army is genuinely at war with parts of the syndicate of jihadi terror in Pakistan like Al Qaeda and the Taliban. It has more than 140,000 troops engaged in operations against the militants along the Afghan border. Some 35,000 Pakistanis including several thousand soldiers have died in the fighting since 2001, the equivalent of a dozen 911s. Dozens of ISI men have died.   But the ISI is also still in bed with other parts of the syndicate like Lashkar e Tayyiba, the group that attacked Mumbai in 2008, and the Afghan Taliban that fights NATO. Despite years of American complaints, those partnerships are still intact. But the terrorists don't stay in the lanes the ISI wants them to stay in. For example, both LeT and the Taliban eulogized bin Laden after his death and mourned the departure of a great \"hero\" of their movements.  The army's ambivalence about the jihad flows from its deep obsession with India. Pakistan - with American help - created the jihad in the 1980s to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. But from the start the ISI, commanded by then dictator Zia ul Huq and his brilliant ISI director general Akhtar Rahman, planed to use jihadi groups against India as well and build an international cadre of mujahedin to help fight India. Over the decades the \"S\" Department of ISI established close connections with scores of jihadi groups, becoming a state within ISI, which in turn is a state within the army. The army decides national-security policy with little or no input from the political establishment.   General Nadeem Taj exemplifies the story. Taj was former dictator Pervez Musharraf's right-hand man. They were together in 1999 when Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif fired Musharraf as chief of army staff while he was returning by plane from a visit to Sri Lanka. Taj orchestrated the coup that put Musharraf in power from the plane and was rewarded with several key jobs including in 2006 command of the Kakul Military Academy in Abbottabad, Pakistan's West Point or Sandhurst.It was on his watch as commandant of the academy that bin Laden moved into his hideout less than a mile away. Was Taj clueless or complicit?\n\nIn September 2007 Taj became DG/ISI replacing General Ashfaq Kayani who was promoted chief of army staff (COAS). Taj lasted less than a year before he was removed under intense pressure from Washington. The Bush administration had concluded that Taj's ISI was directly involved in the bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul in 2008 and was undermining the new drone program to attack Al Qaeda targets inside Pakistan by warning the terrorists before attacks. Taj was regarded as either unable to rein in the S Department or complicit in its duplicity.   Nonetheless, Taj was promoted to command a key corps in the army, the highest command level short of COAS. Now he has been accused of complicity in the planning of the Mumbai attack by several family members of the American victims of the terror rampage in a New York court case. It was on Taj's watch as DG/ISI that the attack was carefully planned by the LeT and the targets, including the Chabad house where most of the Americans died, were selected. David Headley, an American of Pakistani origin, has testified that the ISI was directly involved in the plot, and the US Department of Justice has assembled an impressive body of emails and other evidence that backs up his claims.\n\nThe jihadist penetrations of the army raise persistent questions about the security of Pakistan's nukes. According to a WikiLeaked State Department cable, from September 2009, France's national security adviser Jean-David Levitte told the American Embassy in Paris that France believes it is not secure. Levitte is one of the most astute diplomats in the world today, and he is almost certainly right.\n\nThe policies that would help wean the Pakistani army off its obsession with India and jihad are well known. A concerted effort to end the Indo-Pakistani conflict is essential. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, despite Mumbai, is trying to do just that. But it is a hard challenge. Talks to resolve the relatively simple issue of the disputed Siachen Glacier, the world's highest war zone at the roof of the Himalayas, failed again in May. The harder issue, Kashmir, will probably take years to resolve at best.\n\nBut we don't have years. Only a fortnight before the Abbottabad raid, General Kayani gave a speech at the military academy in the city, almost within earshot of bin Laden. In his remarks Kayani claimed the back of the militant syndicate in Pakistan had been broken and the army had triumphed. It is now clear he was badly mistaken.\n\n\n\nBruce Riedel is a senior fellow at the Saban Center in the Brookings Institution and adjunct professor at the School for Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.

Defense Secretary Robert Gates, in what he billed as his “last major policy speech in Washington,” has owned up to the gains in Iraq, to the surprise that Iraq has emerged as “the most advanced Arab democracy in the region.” It was messy, this Iraqi democratic experience, but Iraqis “weren’t in the streets shooting each other, the government wasn’t in the streets shooting its people,” Gates observed. The Americans and the Iraqis had not labored in vain; the upheaval of the Arab Spring has only underlined that a decent polity had emerged in the heart of the Arab world.\n\nRobert Gates has not always been a friend of the Iraq war. He was a member in good standing, it should be recalled, of the Iraq Study Group, a panel of sages and foreign policy luminaries, co-chaired by James Baker and Lee Hamilton, who had taken a jaundiced view of the entire undertaking in Iraq. Their report endorsed a staged retreat from the Iraq war and an accommodation with Syria and Iran. When Gates later joined the cabinet of George W. Bush, after the “thumping” meted out to the Republicans in the congressional elections of 2006, his appointment was taken as a sharp break with the legacy of his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld. It was an open secret that the outlook of the new taciturn man at the Department of Defense had no place in it for the spread of democracy in Arab lands. Over a long career, Secretary Gates had shared the philosophical approach of Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft, peers of his and foreign policy “realists” who took the world as it is. They had styled themselves as unillusioned men who had thought that the Iraq war, and George W. Bush’s entire diplomacy of freedom, were projects of folly—romantic, self deluding undertakings in the Arab world.\n\nTo the extent that these men thought of the Greater Middle East, they entered it through the gateway of the Israeli-Palestinian struggle. The key to the American security dilemma in the region, they maintained, was an Arab-Israeli settlement that would drain the swamps of anti-Americanism and reconcile the Arab “moderates” to the Pax Americana. This was a central plank of the Iraq Study Group—the centrality of the Israeli-Palestinian issue to the peace of the region, and to the American position in the lands of Islam.\n\nNor had Robert Gates made much of a secret of his reading of Iran. He and Zbigniew Brzezinski had been advocates of “engaging” the regime in Tehran—this was part of the creed of the “realists.” It was thus remarkable that, in his last policy speech, Gates acknowledged a potentially big payoff of the American labor in Iraq: a residual U.S. military presence in that country as a way of monitoring the Iranian regime next door.\n\nIs Gates right about both the progress in Iraq and the U.S. future in the country? In short, yes. The Iraqis needn’t trumpet the obvious fact in broad daylight, but the balance of power in the Persian Gulf would be altered for the better by a security arrangement between the United States and the government in Baghdad. The Sadrists have already labeled a potential accord with the Americans as a deal with the devil, but the Sadrists have no veto over the big national decisions in Baghdad. If the past is any guide, Prime Minister Nuri Al Maliki has fought and won a major battle with the Sadrists; he crushed them on the battlefield but made room for them in his coalition government, giving them access to spoils and patronage, but on his terms.\n\nDemocracy, it turns out, has its saving graces: Nuri Al Maliki need not shoulder alone the burden of sustaining a security accord with the Americans. He has already made it known that the decision to keep American forces in Iraq would depend on the approval of the major political blocs in the country, and that the Sadrists would have no choice but to accept the majority’s decision. The Sadrists would be left with the dubious honor of “resistance” to the Americans—but they would hold onto the privileges granted them by their access to state treasury and resources. Muqtada Al Sadr and the political functionaries around him know that life bereft of government patronage and the oil income of a centralized state is a journey into the wilderness.\n\nThere remains, of course, the pledge given by presidential candidate Barack Obama that a President Obama would liquidate the American military role in Iraq by the end of 2011. That pledge was one of the defining themes of his bid for the presidency, and it endeared him to the “progressives” within his own party, who had been so agitated and mobilized against the Iraq war. But Barack Obama is now the standard-bearer of America’s power. He has broken with the “progressives” over Afghanistan, the use of drones in Pakistan, Guantánamo, military tribunals, and a whole host of national security policies that have (nearly) blurred the line between his policies and those of his predecessor. The left has grumbled, but, in the main, it has bowed to political necessity. At any rate, the fury on the left that once surrounded the Iraq war has been spent; a residual American presence in Iraq would fly under the radar of the purists within the ranks of the Democratic Party. They will be under no obligation to give it their blessing. That burden would instead be left to the centrists—and to the Republicans.\n\nIt is perhaps safe to assume that Robert Gates is carrying water for the Obama administration—an outgoing official putting out some necessary if slightly unpalatable political truths. Gates is an intensely disciplined man; he has not been a free-lancer, but instead has forged a tight personal and political relationship with President Obama. His swan song in Washington is most likely his gift to those left with maintaining and defending the American position in Iraq and in the Persian Gulf.\n\nIt is a peculiarity of the American-Iraq relationship that it could yet be nurtured and upheld without fanfare or poetry. The Iraqis could make room for that residual American presence while still maintaining the fiction of their political purity and sovereignty. For their part, American officials could be discreet and measured; they needn’t heap praise on Iraq nor take back what they had once said about the war—and its costs and follies. Iraq’s neighbors would of course know what would come to pass. In Tehran, and in Arab capitals that once worried about an American security relationship with a Shia-led government in Baghdad, powers would have to make room for this American-Iraqi relationship. The Iranians in particular will know that their long border with Iraq is, for all practical purposes, a military frontier with American forces. It will be no consolation for them that this new reality so close to them is the work of their Shia kinsmen, who come to unexpected power in Baghdad.\n\nThe enemy will have a say on how things will play out for American forces in Iraq. Iran and its Iraqi proxies can be expected to do all they can to make the American presence as bloody and costly as possible. A long, leaky border separates Iran from Iraq; movement across it is quite easy for Iranian agents and saboteurs. They can come in as “pilgrims,” and there might be shades of Lebanon in the 1980s, big deeds of terror that target the American forces. The Iraqi government will be called upon to do a decent job of tracking and hunting down saboteurs and terrorists, as this kind of intelligence is not a task for American soldiers. This will take will and political courage on the part of Iraq’s rulers. They will have to speak well of the Americans and own up to the role that American forces are playing in the protection and defense of Iraq. They can’t wink at anti-Americanism or give it succor.\n\nEven in the best of worlds, an American residual presence in Iraq will have its costs and heartbreak. But the United States will have to be prepared for and accept the losses and adversity that are an integral part of staying on, rightly, in so tangled and difficult a setting.\n\n\n\nFouad Ajami teaches at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.

For Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, that has become the question. \nNot long ago, Ahmadinejad was regarded as the most powerful of the five presidents the Islamic Republic in its three decades of existence. \nWith the opposition \"green\" movement almost silenced, his administration faced no serious challenge within the Khomeinist movement establishment. Ahmadinejad also marked some success selling his doctrine of \"Iranian Islam\" as a substitute for the hotchpotch concocted by Ayatollah Khomeini. Translated into 30 languages, his authorised biography, \"Ahmadinejad: The Miracle of the Century\", was supposed to have sold a million copies. \nHis entourage boasted that, in the 2009 presidential election he would have won 35 million, rather than 25 million accorded him. The entourage claimed that, Ahmadinejad lost 10 million votes because of his association with \"Supreme Guide\" Ali Khamenei.\nThe entourage also claimed that Ahmadinejad supporters are poised to win a two-thirds majority in next year's parliamentary election. \nToday, things look different. \nTehran is full of rumors that, deeply depressed, Ahmadinejad may be thinking of stepping down. \nThe media controlled by Khamenei maintain a daily barrage of attacks against the president. \nThe other day, the newspaper Kayhan ran this headline: \"Ahmadinejad on Way to Anathema (Takfir)\".\nMedia attacks may not be the main source of Ahmadinejad's reported depression. Hardly a day passes without Khamenei vetoing a decision of the president.\nAhmadinejad wanted to sack Heydar Moslehi, the Minister of Intelligence and Security. Khamenei intervened to reinstate the minister whose incompetence had become proverbial.\nAhmadinejad sulked for 11 days before swallowing \"the biter pill\" and re-admitting the mullah Moslehi to the Cabinet.\nAhmadinejad wanted to merge four ministries to cut bureaucratic costs. Khamenei intervened to refer the matter to the Islamic Majis, Iran's fake parliament.\nThe \"Supreme Guide\" also ordered that new ministers submit to a vote of confidence in the Majlis.\nThe message that Ahmadinejad is in office at Khamenei's pleasure is circulated by the latter's entourage. The other day, Muhammad-Reza Bahonar, a Khamenei mouthpiece in the Majlis, told the press that the \"Supreme Guide\" wanted \" to retain the president until the natural end of his administration\" in 2013.\nThe media controlled by Khamenei miss no opportunity to brand Ahmadinejad's closest associate, Esfandiar Masha'i, as \"an enemy of Islam\", a \" Persian nationalist\", and even \"an agent of Imperialism.\" \nIn a statement circulated in Tehran last week, Hezbollah, a group controlled by security services, threatened to kill Masha'i.\nAt the same time, Khamenei has ordered the Larijani brothers to prepare the \"after Ahmadinejad\". The eldest brother, Ali-Ardeshir, the Speaker of the Majlis, is already casting himself as the next president of the republic. The second brother, Sadeq, who wears the clothes of a mullah, is using his position as Chief Justice to threaten Ahmadinejad with \"legal consequences\" of the government's unspecified decisions. A third Larijani brother, Muhammad-Jawad, has informed British contacts that with \"Ahmadinejad's imminent end\", there would be \" a new beginning in Iranian foreign policy.\"\nIn a bid to repair relations with Riyadh, Ahmadinejad wanted to dispatch Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Salehi to Saudi Arabia for a \"working visit\". Khamenei signaled his opposition through newspapers controlled by his office.\nFor weeks, Ahmadinejad tired to appoint a Governor for the Fars province. His choice was chased away by Khamenei henchmen laying siege to the governor's office in Shiraz.\nHardly a day passes without a mullah, including some on his payroll until recently, attacking Ahmadinejad. Often, it is clear that Khamenei offered a fatter envelope to the mullah concerned.\nThe military are also ranged against Ahmadinejad. Once regarded as Ahmadinejad's principal supporters, Revolutionary Guard generals are appearing on TV to denounce the president's \"deviant tendency.\" \nEven on minor issues, Khamenei is advertising his authority. \nLast week, Ahmadinejad's office approved a decision by the Iranian Academy to replace the French word \"police\", in use in Iran since the 19th century, with the Persian word \"passvar.\" \nThis was part of Ahmadinejad's decision to \"purify\" the Persian vocabulary by getting rid of Arabic and other foreign words. \nKhamenei vetoed the decision as\" another sign of Iranian nationalism\" which he regards as a threat to Islam. \nFew in Tehran missed the irony of a mullah defending a French word against a Persian equivalent.\nPro-Khamenei newspapers drop hints about \"secret contacts\" between Ahmadinejad and the \"green\" opposition to form a front against Khamenei. There is talk of former President Hashemi Rafsanjani setting aside his old hatred of Ahmadinejad in a bid to isolate the \"Supreme Guide\".\nFinally, security forces have arrested over 50 members of Ahmadinejad's entourage, including some close friends, on charges of \"spreading unauthorized beliefs\".\nWhat does all this mean?\nThere is no doubt that Ahmadinejad and Khamenei are at loggerheads. This is no surprise. As explained in a previous column all presidents have had trouble with the \"Supreme Guide\" of the time. Sharing power at the summit is always problematic. Unable to fly, a double-headed eagle often tears itself apart.    Initially, Ahmadinejad angered Khamenei by scripting his group out of numerous juicy contracts and business deals.   However, for the first time, the fight may also be about something more than personal power.\nAhmadinejad has realised the bankruptcy of the Khomeinist discourse and is trying to replace it with a pseudo-nationalistic, and perhaps more dangerous, narrative in which the mullahs have no place.  Khamenei may be trying to push Ahmadinejad to the brink in the hope that the president would lose his nerve and throw in the towel. However, Ahmadinejad might prove a tougher cookie than Khamenei apparently hopes.  My guess is that Ahmadinejad will not jump and, if pushed, would not flee into exile as did the first President of the Islamic Republic Abol-Hassan Banisadr. Nor would Ahmadinejad kowtow to the \"Supreme Guide\" as did Rafsanjani and Muhammad Khatami.   What about assassination? That is what happened to Muhammad-Ali Raja'i, the second President of the Islamic Republic.   That Khamenei is attacking Ahmadinejad every day is a sign that the \"Supreme Guide\" is scared.

Objective: an alliance between\nright-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections\n\nNEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru who was\nDonald Trump’s right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following the racist\nviolence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the Daily Beast\nhimself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (Il Movimento), right in the heart of Europe\nand its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the European\nelections which will be held in spring 2019.\n\nObjective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor of the\nDemocratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in support of\nNGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist right, accused of\nplots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to have labour at\nlow cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the Interior Matteo\nSalvini.\n\nThe ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in the\nEuropean campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and Rome\n— is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great “populist international” of which he has long\nsince been dreaming.\n\nThe Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic\nadvice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European movements.\nAnalysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling funding.\n\nThe aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of “super group” that if victorious can conquer up to a third\nof the European Parliament in the elections next May.\n\nIndeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The\nAmerican strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress —\nand in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data stolen from\nFacebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump emerged victor. It is not\na mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West.

Does it \nexplain sweetheart deal? \nUpdated: 12:28 p.m. Wednesday, May 30, 2018 Posted: 12:21 p.m. Wednesday, May 30, \n2018 \nE-gcer. \nUma Sanghvi WEST PALM BEACH \nTen years after convicted Palm Beach sex offender Jeffrey Epstein escaped federal charges \nin connection with allegations that he paid dozens of teenage girls for sex, the FBI last week \nreleased what appears to be an explosive explanation for what many have long described as \na sweetheart deal. \n\"Epstein has also provided information to the FBI as agreed upon,\" agents wrote in one of \ndozens of heavily redacted, decade-old memos that were unexpectedly and inexplicably \nposted on an FBI website known as \"The Vault.\" \nThe simple declaration stunned those who have been following the tortuous and celebrity-\nstudded case for years. It rekindled talk that the billionaire's 2008 decision to plead guilty to \nstate charges to make the federal investigation disappear was part of a cover up to protect \nEpstein's high-powered friends, including President Donald Trump, former President Bill  \nClinton and Britain's Prince Andrew. \n\"That sentence obviously means something but I, too, am at a loss as to what it really \nmeans,\" said attorney Brad Edwards, who for a decade has been trying to unravel the \nmystery of Epstein's plea deal. \"If there was some cooperation I would have expected that \nwe would have been told. However, nothing surprises me at this point.\" \nIn recent years, federal prosecutors have offered various explanations for why they agreed to \ndrop the case they were building against the 65-year-old enigmatic money manager if he \npleaded guilty to state prostitution charges. In court papers, they have said they wanted to \nget justice for Epstein's young victims but worried a jury wouldn't believe them. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028536 \nSo, they have said, they negotiated a deal, allowing Epstein to plead guilty in Palm Beach \nCounty Circuit Court to one count of soliciting a minor for prostitution and another charge \nof soliciting prostitution. In exchange, federal prosecutors agreed to close their investigation. \nThey have said they had no idea Epstein would only serve 13 months of an 18-month \nsentence in a vacant wing of the county stockade___a cell he was allowed to leave 16 hours \na day, six days a week. \nWhile voicing dismay at his lax punishment, prosecutors have pointed out that the plea deal \nrequired Epstein to pay the roughly 30 young women who filed civil lawsuits against him. \nFurther, they said his guilty pleas force him to register as a sex offender for the rest of his \nlife, potentially protecting other girls from abuse in the future. \nHowever, over the years, they have never suggested that Epstein provided them any \ninformation in return. \nLike Edwards, two people close to the long-closed federal investigation said they were \nflummoxed by the sentence in the FBI's memo that was written in September 2008, roughly \ntwo months after Epstein pleaded guilty in state court. \n\"I have never, ever heard of Jeffrey Epstein cooperating in any sense of the word,\" said one \nofficial, who requested anonymity because of the top role the person played in the \ninvestigation. \"I am stumped. It's totally out of left field.\" \nAnother individual with ties to the case voiced similar views. Epstein may have been \nrequired to talk to FBI agents but it's unlikely he offered anything that would incriminate \nothers, said the person, who declined to be identified because of ongoing efforts to help \nEpstein's victims challenge the plea deal. \"I don't think he ever told the truth,\" the person \nsaid. \nA lawsuit Edwards filed against the federal government, claiming prosecutors violated the \nVictims Rights Act by not notifying Epstein's victims of the pending plea deal, is still \npending in U.S. District Court. Also, awaiting trial in Palm Beach County Circuit Court is a \nmalicious prosecution lawsuit Edwards filed against Epstein. Edwards claims the billionaire \nfiled a frivolous lawsuit to punish Edwards for representing a handful of Epstein's young \nvictims. \nWest Palm Beach attorney Jack Goldberger, who was on Epstein's potent defense team, said \nhe was \"unable to respond\" to questions about the FBI's memo. Other prominent lawyers \nwho represented Epstein, including New York lawyer Jay Lefkowitz and retired Harvard law \nprofessor Alan Dershowitz, didn't respond to requests for comment. \nThe one line was part of a brief missive dated Sept. 18, 2008, closing the case: \"On 9/11/08, \ncase agent advised writer that Epstein is currently being prosecuted by the State of Florida \nand is complying with all conditions of his plea with the State of Florida. Epstein has also \nprovided information to the FBI as agreed upon. Case agent advised that no federal \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028537 \nprosecution will occur in this matter as long as Epstein continues to uphold his agreement \nwith the State of Florida. ... Case agent is requested to contact writer in the event this matter \nmoves forward on a federal level.\" \nThe memo was one of hundreds of documents, including dozens of copies of newspaper \narticles about Epstein, that were posted on the FBI's website. The website, \nwww.vaultibi.gov, serves as the FBI's electronic FOIA library. The heavily redacted \ndocuments showed agents traveled to New York City, Sante Fe, N.M., and St. Thomas in the \nU.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein has homes. But there is little information about who they \ninterviewed or what they learned. \nThe only witness named in the documents is Alfredo Rodriguez, who was a houseman at \nEpstein's Palm Beach mansion in 2004. That's when Epstein regularly paid young women to \ngive him sexually-charged massages, police said. \nRodriguez was convicted of obstruction of justice in 2010 and sentenced to 18 months in jail \nfor trying to sell a journal he purloined from Epstein. Prosecutors said the journal detailed \nEpstein's sexual dalliances. Rodriguez, who lived in Kendall, died in 2014. \nThose familiar with FBI procedures said the records are administrative files, not \ninvestigative ones. Some questioned why the files were posted on the FBI's web site. The \nFBI didn't return a phone call for comment. According to the web site, the records were \nreleased \"in compliance with the National Archives and Records Administration \nrequirements.\" \nAnd while it's been 10 years since Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges and settled \ndozens of lawsuits with young women, litigation continues. \nScott J.

However, since the Advisory Committee will be making many decisions about how to best change\nthe rules, one concluding thought may be worth highlighting.\n\nCongress will be paying close attention to how courts protect the rights of future victims. Indeed, the CVRA directs the\nAdministrative Office for the U.S. Courts to report each year the number of times that victims have attempted to assert their\nrights and been denied the requested relief. 344 More generally, Congress views the new Act as an important step to protecting\ncrime victims - a \"new and bolder approach, than has ever been tried before in our Federal system.\" 34> Congress is eagerly\nawaiting the results of this approach. As Senator Leahy warned, \"Passage of this bill will necessitate careful oversight of its\nimplementation by Congress.\" >4° Victims' advocates, too, will be watching carefully. *47\n\nIn light of this thorough and ongoing interest, the judiciary should not merely attempt a \"quick fix\" or minimalist approach to\nimplementing the CVRA, but should comprehensively protect crime victims’ rights by changes in court rules. If Congress\nbelieves that the federal rules fail to faithfully reflect crime victims’ concerns, it can directly amend the rules. But such direct\namendments may not sufficiently attend to the needs of the judicial branch or others involved in the criminal justice process.

Finally, I admitted that the\nonly term I had to cover this depth of emotion was \"love\"... but that couldn't make it feel\nlike the right word. Then again, it wasn't exactly \"hate\", either.\n\nHe was a demon, an idol. He hardly felt like a person to me.\n\nI didn't vocalize any of this. Coming back from the waterfront, we arrived at the\nintersection where Richard would go to his apartment and I'd return to mine. An awkward\npause ensued: I was leaving in a few days, and wouldn't be alone with him again.\nWatching him, I wondered if he was thinking about asking me over, or was looking for\nan excuse not to. I looked away.\n\n\"Goodnight,\" I said. Walking home, I wished I felt strong.\n\nte Ok ok\n\nIt was after I left Chicago that I really started piecing myself back together. My anger\ndrained away quickly, as if an infected wound had been lanced. Perhaps I found my\nstrength under the scab. I figured that maybe all this did identify something about my\npersonality, but it didn't tell the whole story. Even now, I could be independent, rational,\nand feminist, with self-esteem and integrity. Right? Right.\n\nIt was impossible to deny that the desires were real -- and when I allowed myself to focus\non them, I didn't try. Ruminating on my past, I recalled heart-twisting details that put\neverything in a certain compelling context. It wasn't just the man who'd gone after me in\n2003. Wincing, I remembered childhood fantasies: I'd compulsively written and drawn\nbrutal dreams until, at some confused middle-school point, their horror came home to me\nand I recoiled. In those long-repressed fictions of slavery and pain, I recognized my\nnewly-acknowledged desires.\n\nOne conversation I'd had with an early boyfriend rang in my head. \"There's a dark current\ninside me,\" I'd told him. Self-consciously, I'd averted my eyes at my own melodrama. \"I\ndon't know how to be with you, when I feel it.\" I hadn't exactly been trying to leave him,\nbut I'd needed something more.\n\nThe last dream I remember of Richard didn't involve any pain at all: he just kissed me.\nAwakening, I felt a melancholy pang. Richard invested a lot of self-conception in being a\nsadist, and he was so distant -- I couldn't imagine relating to him as a lover. And I knew\nour relationship (such as it was) would never have started without BDSM as a focus.\nPrevious to that night at the outdoor party, he'd hardly registered on my romantic radar,\nand we had little in common in terms of how we dealt with relationships.\n\nStill, for a moment I wished -- unreasonably, I knew -- that I could have fallen\nstraightforwardly in love.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018455\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Company A learns about a potential $50 million contract with the country’s Ministry of Immigration. This\nis a very attractive opportunity to Company A, both for its profitability and to open the door to future projects with the\ngovernment. At the suggestion of the company’s senior vice president of international sales (Sales Executive), Company A\nhires a local businessman who assures them that he has strong ties to political and government leaders in the country and\ncan help them win the contract. Company A enters into a consulting contract with the local businessman (Consultant). The\nagreement requires Consultant to use his best efforts to help the company win the business and provides for Consultant to\nreceive a significant monthly retainer as well as a success fee of 3% of the value of any contract the company wins.\n\nWhat steps should Company A consider taking before hiring Consultant?\n\nThere are several factors here that might lead Company A to perform heightened FCPA-related due diligence prior\nto retaining Consultant: (1) the market (high-risk country); (2) the size and significance of the deal to the company; (3) the\ncompany’s first time use of this particular consultant; (4) the consultant’s strong ties to political and government leaders;\n(5) the success fee structure of the contract; and (6) the vaguely-defined services to be provided. In order to minimize the\nlikelihood of incurring FCPA liability, Company A should carefully vet Consultant and his role in the transaction, including\nclose scrutiny of the relationship between Consultant and any Ministry of Immigration officials or other government officials.\nAlthough there is nothing inherently illegal about contracting with a third party that has close connections to politicians\nand government officials to perform legitimate services on a transaction, this type of relationship can be susceptible to\ncorruption. Among other things, Company A may consider conducting due diligence on Consultant, including background\n\n(cont'd)\n\n63\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022565\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Millions of people use cannabis recreationally.\nMillions more use it medicinally. In aggregate, across all state medical cannabis laws in the United States,\ncannabis is legally recognized as a form of therapy or medicine for more than 50 medical conditions,\nincluding Alzheimer’s disease, anorexia, arthritis, cancer, chronic pain, epilepsy and post-traumatic\nstress disorder. Similar to the alcohol and pharmaceutical markets, we believe that the total addressable\nconsumer market for cannabis consists of a significant portion of the global adult population.\n\nCannabis is the most widely cultivated, produced, trafficked and consumed drug worldwide,\naccording to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). In 2003, the UNODC\nestimated that the global illegal cannabis market was $113 billion, with 160 million consumers. The\nUNODC continues to estimate the number of cannabis users worldwide and recently estimated that\n183 million people globally between the ages of 15 and 64, or more than 4% of this age group, con-\nsumed cannabis in 2015.\n\nIn 2010, the RAND Corporation (RAND) estimated that the U.S. illegal cannabis market was\n$40 billion. Adjusting this estimate solely for inflation and population growth, the U.S. illegal market\nwould now be approximately $48 billion.\n\nBoth the UNODC and RAND acknowledge the challenges inherent in studying an illegal con-\nsumer market, and both allow significant room for error in their estimates. However approximate,\ntheir estimates make clear that there is significant global demand for cannabis. Less clear is how quickly\nillegal markets will transition to legal markets, as well as the extent to which legalization may increase\noverall demand.\n\nWe believe that the growth of the global legal cannabis industry will be driven by increasing pen-\netration in largely untapped “mainstream” consumer markets, and that the legal industry could grow\nto more than two times the estimated size of the current illegal market. We believe that cannabis will\neventually become federally legal in the United States, for recreational enjoyment by adults and for use\nin a broad range of safe drugs and therapeutic products. After U.S. federal legalization, we believe that\n\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC 1\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024637\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Culture Label recently\nopened an online art shop, with work\nfrom.550 artists costing between £100\nand £2,000. The shop is a collaboration\nwith Own Art, an Arts Council\ninitiative, through which you can pay in\ninterest-free instalments.\n\nMeanwhile, the website easyart.com,\nwhich tailors its artworks to buyers\nwith interior decoration in mind, has\nlaunched an iPhone app that lets you\ntest 50,000 prints, in different frames,\nina picture of the room that you wish\nto decorate.\n\nNol everyone recommends buying\nonline, however, as we discovered by\nasking top interior designers for their\ntips on purchasing art for yourhome.\n\nJoanna Wood, head of the eponymous\nloxury interior design firm, firmly\nstates that buying online is never a good\nidea for original artworks. “For a series\nof prints that you have seen before,\nonline could be an option. But don't buy\nan original painting from a website\nbecause so much of it is about texture.\n\n| feel'and perspective.”\n\nWood shops for works in the streets\n\n' off Piccadilly, but also recommends\n\nthe Art London fair for affordable\n\n| pieces, as does Anita Kohn, of the\n\narchitectural firm Living in Space,\nwho also loves the Affordable Art Fair.\n“The atmosphere is buzzy, the gallerists\n\n! are friendly and no piece costs more\n\nthan £3,000,” she says. “1 used to buy\nrandomly, but now I am more focused\nand collect works on paper — Old\nMaster drawings or Impressionist\nworks, often from sale rooms.”\nKamini Ezralow, of the international\n\n: design company Intarya, recommends\n\nscouring markets and galleries when\ntravelling to pick up local art and craft\npieces: “If you see a work in a gallery\nthat you like closer to home, go back\nand ask to see more by the same artist.\nYou can then build a relationship with\nthat gallerist and use them as a regular\nsource for pieces that suit your taste and\n\n: price capacity.”\n\nKohn recommends starting with\n\n: prints and advises shopping with an\n\nopen mind “so that you don't buy\nsomething purely because it fits with\n\n: your self-imposed criteria. The vital\n: thing is to buy something that you love,\n| because you will be looking at it every\n\ningle day”.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028322\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

That matters\nfor at least three major reasons.\n\nFirst, mindful agents have both\nintentions and the capacity for self-\ncontrol.

Heartbleed, a “zero\nday” that permitted hackers to slip into your computer via holes in website and\nbrowser security, was disclosed to the world on April 7, 2014 - more than two years\nafter it had apparently been put in place because of a programming error.\nAccidentally?

This permitted them to reach “off limits”, super secure areas\nof the machine’s memory where they could do what they wanted.

The “Stay of Actions Pending State\nNegotiations” section inserted into the bill allows a stay to be granted for an indefinitely\nrenewable 180-day period. This would be subject to court petition by the Attorney\nGeneral and repeated certification by the Secretary of State that the US is “engaged in\ngood faith discussions with the foreign state defendant concerning the resolution of the\nclaims against the foreign state”. The certification thus depends on the current and\nfuture US administration foreign policy inclinations, in our view. Separately, we note\nthat the White House spokesman said US President Obama did not support the\nlegislation and likely would not sign it. (A potential presidential veto may however still\nbe overruled if Congress assembles the necessary two-thirds vote of each house).

But I end up framing ideas of biology in the language\n\nof economics rather than the opposite. I begin with\n\ntotal capital = means of ends = means of replication = fitness,\n\nwhere fitness is understood as a stock. The concomitant flow and rate would be\n\noutput (creation of fitness/total capital) and return (ratio of the two).\n\nFree growth theory gave the inference\n\noptimum ex ante output = optimum controllable output\n\n= exact offset of pure consumption, at the collective scale.\n\nNext generation theory specified the period of this exhaust and recovery as the\n\ngeneration length.\n\nConsider Hamilton’s rule in this context. All ex ante output, continuing steadily at\nthe generation rate, must be invested concurrently in the next generation or stored\nfor later investment within the deadline. It is the problem of Brewster’s millions.\nAdults must invest or store as efficiently as practical (the maximand rule) before the\noutput means has slipped by. And the more stored instead, the more pressure to\ninvest later within the deadline. Time left for investment is another of the practical\n\nconstraints on maximization of rb/c.\n\nWhat I sense is a watering down of Hamilton’s rule from what seemed logical\ncompulsion a few decades ago to something more like a target of opportunity.

As such, Treasurer Neal Blinde noted that\nWFC could realize a modestly better benefit to spread income from a steepening\nyield curve vs. the current +$150mn/qtr expectation from a 25bp parallel shift. He\noutlined how the bank’s actions to manage an interest rate cycle via balance sheet\npositioning protect on the downside (i.e. post-Brexit) while at the same time allow\nfor an uptick when rates rise. WFC received numerous investor questions on when\nthey would deploy its dry power ($572bn in liquidity), and management noted that\nthe rate backdrop — not question marks on deposit duration — mostly drove\ndeployment decisions.\n\nWFC reiterated its performance targets disclosed at its Investor Day. WFC\nreiterated its 2-yr performance targets: (1) 1.1-1.4% ROA; (2) 11-14% ROE; (3) 55-\n59% efficiency ratio; and (4) 55-75% net capital payout. As of 3Q16, the bank is\ncurrently within these ranges on all metrics except for efficiency (3Q: 59.4%). This\nis consistent with the 61% of the audience polled that expect WFC to perform\nwithin the targeted ROE range as headwinds from Retail Banking is offset by an\nimprovement in the macro-economy.

Because\nwages are deductible from taxable income, it essentially taxes domestically\nproduced goods as a share of value added but taxes imports as a share of their\ntotal value. This is a clear discrimination that would certainly invite WTO\ndispute and that could potentially give future non-Republican administrations\nthe excuse to overturn the tax reform. Moreover, the fact that under the\ncurrent proposal some exporters will potentially pay no taxes does not seem\nfair to us. Remember, in most countries with a VAT system, there is also a\ncorporate income tax. In this scenario, we assume that after negotiations we\nget a true VAT that is both WTO compliant as well as being revenue neutral.\nThe USD would do better in this scenario compared to Scenario 3 because the\nVAT would help level the playing fields between US and foreign produced\ngoods and the US trade balance should improve.\n\nHow to trade it?\n\nWe view the recent weakening of the USD and rising inflation breakevens as mutually\ninconsistent, since we think Scenario 2 is not a viable political outcome. The fact that all\nother scenarios are associated with a stronger USD and lower to flat inflation\nbreakevens is supportive of our bullish USD view.\n\nThe market needs more clarity on the details of the fiscal reform proposal to determine\nthe outlook for the USD and rates. It is possible that details may be unveiled as early as\nthe president’s speech to the joint session of Congress on February 28, 2017. We think\nit could validate our view of a stronger USD.\n\nTaking advantage of clean positioning and the decline in implied FX vol lately, we\nrecommend buying a 6w ATM EUR put/USD call (spot reference at 1.0630). A 6-week\noption will cover also the March Fed meeting and the Dutch election (both on March 15}\nthat can both potentially work in favour of the trade.\n\nWe think the market is underpricing the risk of a Fed hike in March and better-than-\nexpected results by the Freedom Party in the Dutch election could intensify concerns of\na second-round Le Pen win in May.

We treat these individuals as if born at the beginning of the decade.\n\nFor every parsed article, we append metadata relating to the importance of the article within Wikipedia,\nnamely the size in words of the article and the number of page views which it obtains. The article word\ncount is created by directly accessing the article using its URL. The traffic statistics for Wikipedia articles\nare obtained from http://stats.grok.se/.\n\nFigure $10a displays the number of records parsed from Wikipedia and retained for the final cohort\nanalysis. Table S7 displays specific examples from the extraction’s output, including name, year of birth,\nyear of death, approximate word count of main article and traffic statistics for March 2010.\n\n1) Create a database of records referring to people born 1800-1980 in Wikipedia.\n\na. Using the DBPedia framework, find all articles which are members of the categories\n‘{700_births’ through ‘1980_births’. Only people both in 1800-1980 are used for the\npurposes of fame analysis. People born in 1700-1799 are used to identify naming\nambiguities as described in section III.7.A.7 of this Supplementary Material.\n\nb. For all these articles, create a record identified by the article URL, and append the birth\nyear.\n\nc. For every record, use the URL to navigate to the online Wikipedia page. Within the main\narticle body text, remove all HTML markup tags and perform a word count. Append this\nword count to the record.\n\nd. For every record, use the URL to determine the page’s traffic statistics for the month of\nMarch 2010. Append the number of views to the record.\n\nl1.7.A.2 — Identification of occupation for individuals appearing in Wikipedia.\n\nTwo types of structural elements within Wikipedia enable us to identify, for certain individuals, their\noccupation. The first, Wikipedia Categories, was previously described and used to recognize articles\nabout people. Wikipedia Categories also contain information pertaining to occupation. The categories\n“Physicists”, “Physicists by Nationality’, “Physicists stubs”, along with their subcategories, pinpoint articles\nof relating to the occupation of physicist. The second are Wikipedia Lists, special pages dedicated to\nlisting Wikipedia articles which fit a precise subject. For physicists, relevant examples are “List of\nphysicists”, “List of plasma physicists” and “List of theoretical physicists”. Given their redundancy, these\ntwo structural elements, when used in combination provide a strong means of identifying the occupation\nof an individual.\n\nNext, we selected the top 50 individuals in each category, and annotated each one manually as a function\nof the individual's main occupation, as determined by reading the associated Wikipedia article. For\ninstance, “Che Guevara’ was listed in Biologists; so even though he was a medical doctor by training, this\nis not his primary historical contribution. The most famous individuals of each category born between\n1800 and 1920 are given in Appendix.\n\nIn our database of individuals, we append, when available, information about the occupations of people.\nThis enables the comparison, on the basis of fame, of groups of individuals distinguished by their\noccupational decisions.\n\n2) Associate Wikipedia records of individuals with occupations using relevant Wikipedia\n“Categories” and “Lists” pages. For every occupation to be investigated :\na. Manually create a list of Wikipedia categories and lists associated with this defined\noccupation.\nb. Using the DBPedia framework, find all the Wikipedia articles which are members of the\nchosen Wikipedia categories.\n\n20\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017028\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Yes, each of\nthe men was almost sure to be armed. But these flats were their homes. Very\nlikely, members of their families would be there. If the operation went as\nplanned, it was hard to imagine how any of the men would have a chance of\nsurviving. My answer was that ideally we would face them on a battlefield. Yet\ngiven the nature of Black September, that was not going to happen. Mossad was\nright to conclude this was the only way to isolate and attack them.\n\nFor Amitai Nachmani, who would be leading the attack on one of the\napartments, my words were not enough. Twice, he came to see me. It was not\nthat he didn’t trust or respect me as his commander, he said. But before leading\nhis team into Beirut, he needed to satisfy himself that the people we were\nattacking, and the way we were attacking them, had been properly thought\nthrough by the people giving the orders. I told him I understood. I did not tell\nhim that I was actually proud of him for asking — which, although I’m sure he\nsensed it, was an omission I regretted when he lost his life in the Sinai Desert a\nfew months later. But I did go see Dado. I told him what Amitai had said. He\nneeded no convincing when I urged him to address the entire Beirut team and\nanswer their questions at our final planning meeting. He did so, explaining how\nand why the decision to target these three Palestinians had been reached, to the\nsatisfaction of Amitai and the others.\n\nWe set off by missile boat from Haifa on the afternoon of April ninth. To my\nrelief, since I suffer from seasickness, the Mediterranean was calm as we\nheaded west towards Cyprus, before circling back in the direction of the\nLebanese coast after nightfall. I ran through the plan a final time with each\nmember of the team and then joined Amiram and Lonny in transforming\nourselves as best we could into credible dates for the evening. I’d vetoed dresses\nor high heels, in favor of flared slacks and flats. We used standard-issue army\nsocks to pad out our bras. The Mossad had recruited a volunteer from a Tel\nAviv beauty parlor to help us with our lipstick, blue eyeliner and eye shadow.\nThe final touch was our wigs. Amiram and Lonny were blondes. I went as a\nstylish brunette.\n\nI’m reluctant to take issue with the Spielberg version of events, if only\nbecause he had my part played by someone undeniably better looking than I\nwas, even as a 31-year-old. But in Munich, we are shown zooming into a\ncrowded harbor area on a line of motor boats, changing into drag only once\nwe ve sprinted ashore, opening fire on a dockside kiosk and shooting our way\n\n139\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027987\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

(Squeeze system: also very\nhelpful when gags are involved.)\n\nThomas MacAulay Millar:\n\nThere are all kinds of safesigns when nonverbal communication is necessary; one being\nto give the bottom an object to hold and to drop when at a limit. It has the disadvantage of\nbeing binary, so it loses the middle step that the stoplight system provides.\n\nClarisse Thorn:\n\nSometimes submissives will have a hard time safewording -- whether out of pride,\ninexperience, or eagerness to please -- and that's another reason check-ins can be good\neven when there's a set safeword. If you aren't sure how to read your partner's reactions\nand you suspect ze may be uncomfortable with what you are doing, then you might\nconsider checking in even if ze hasn't safeworded, because your suspicion may be right.\n\nThomas MacAulay Millar:\n\nThis can't be emphasized enough. Tops Can Never Be On Cruise Control! A safeword\ngives the bottom a tool to communicate, but it does not ensure safety. The top has at least\nas much information that the bottom doesn't have, as the bottom has information the top\ndoesn't have. Therefore, the top has to be a full participant in making sure the scene is\nworking and the risks are under control at all times. Anyone who thinks ze can ignore\nsafety as long as the bottom has a safeword is dangerous.\n\nThis post was edited to add: In the comments on this article, Dw3t-Hthr made a powerful\npoint that for some people, safewords are unavailable in scene. She said, in part:\n\n[I]f I am in a place where a safeword might be necessary, a safeword is not possible. Not\njust because I am someone who is regularly nonverbal, but because the altered\nconsciousness state that I achieve makes processing those sorts of questions at best\ndifficult and at worst unachievable...\n\nBut I'm not a bottom, I'm a submissive, and this isn't about \"wanting to please,” it's about\na psychological incapacity to recognise when I might be doing myself damage in certan\nsituations. If I'm not in that state, I can say \"Oh stop doing that it's wrenching my\nShoulder\" or whatever is appropriate. If I am in that state, I cannot indicate and have to\nplace complete trust in the judgement of my partner.\n\nI happen to know that I'm not the only person like this. I think it's important to recognise\nthat safewords are not always possible. It's important, I think, to communicate to the\nperson who resembles me in this that while their brainwiring is not morally incorrect,\nthat they probably ought to think of themselves as Advanced Subjects and try to do their\nthing in a context where the trust and competence required to do it safely is\ndemonstrated.\n\nAlso, a note on terminology: Clarisse used \"submissive\" there in a way where it's not\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018469\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

(HNAH), New York, New York, a registered bank\nholding company (BHC), and the Federal Reserve Board. The order requires HNAH to take corrective\naction to improve its firm-wide compliance risk management program, including its anti-money\nlaundering compliance risk management. Concurrent with the Federal Reserve Board's announcement\nof its enforcement action, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced its issuance of a\nCease and Desist Order against HSBC Bank USA, N.A., McLean, Virginia (HBUS, a subsidiary of\nHNAH), for violating the Bank Secrecy Act and its underlying regulations.\n\nHSBC was directed to use its financial and managerial resources as a source of strength for its bank\nsubsidiaries, and in particular HBUS, to ensure that it complies with the OCC Consent Order regarding\nHBUS' BSA/AML program. It was also directed to “retain an independent consultant acceptable to the\n[Chicago Federal] Reserve Bank to complete a review of the effectiveness of the firm-wide BSA/AML\nCompliance Program adopted by HNAH (the ‘BSA/AML Review’), and to prepare a written report of\nfindings and recommendations (the ‘BSA/AML Report').” In another section of the Order, HNAH was\ndirected to “submit to the [Chicago Federal] Reserve Bank an acceptable written program designed to\nreasonably ensure the identification and timely, accurate, and complete reporting by HNAH and its\nsubsidiaries of all known or suspected violations of law or suspicious transactions to law enforcement\nand supervisory authorities, as required by applicable suspicious activity reporting laws and\nregulations.”\n\nThe OCC Order states that the agency found deficiencies in HBUS’ BSA/AML Compliance Program — in\nparticular, deficiencies in internal controls for customer due diligence, procedures for monitoring\nsuspicious activity and independent testing. The Order also cited aggravating factors “such as highly\nsuspicious activity creating a significant potential for unreported money laundering or terrorist financing.”\nSpecific cited deficiencies included special handling of wire transfers of customers domiciled in\ncountries risk-rated as “standard” or “medium,” resulting in limited and ineffective BSA/AML monitoring\nof two-thirds of the bank's wire activity; failure from 2006 to 2009 to monitor bulk cash transactions with\nforeign affiliates; failure to perform customer due diligence or enhanced due diligence for its foreign\naffiliates, inhibiting its assessment of customer risk and the identification of suspicious activity in\naccounts of those affiliates; failure to address a backlog of suspicious activity alerts (due to inadequate\nstaffing), which caused the bank to file many late SARs; and failure to appropriately designate\ncustomers as “high-risk” for BSA/AML monitoring, even when a customer's association with PEPs could\nharm the bank's reputation. In July 2012, HSBC was the subject of a hearing held by the Senate\nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations entitled “U.S. Vulnerabilities to Money Laundering and\nTerrorist Financing: HSBC Case History.”\n\nCitibank: In April 2012, the OCC issued a Cease and Desist Order against Citibank, N.A. for violations\nof the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and underlying regulations. According to the OCC, the order requires\nthe bank to take comprehensive corrective actions to improve its BSA compliance program.\n\nThe compliance program allegedly had deficiencies with respect to internal controls, customer due\ndiligence, the independent BSA and the anti-money laundering audit function, monitoring of its remote\ndeposit capture and international cash letter instrument processing in connection with foreign\ncorrespondent banking, and suspicious activity reporting related to that monitoring. These findings\nresulted in violations by the bank of statutory and regulatory requirements to maintain an adequate BSA\ncompliance program, file suspicious activity reports, and conduct appropriate due diligence on foreign\ncorrespondent accounts.\n\nprotiviti | 22\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024128\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Re asking her for dinner.. | have\ngone back over emails from that period. | have numerous requests from her to go for coffee to talk, which | usually had to turn down\nbecause | was busy, including several occasions where she asked me to have coffee with her off campus to talk, and | politely\ndeclined. | did let her accompany me off campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it. |\ndid and do have coffee and meals with students on campus, and | see nothing wrong with this. | was shocked when | later learned of\nher complaint, not least because there was no inappropriate interaction and also because well after the date on which she is said to\nhave been offended, she continued to email me with joking questions or comments, and at a AAAS conference in 2008, for which she\nhad asked, and for which | had written her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife and | gave her a lift well out out of our way to\ndrop her off at her hotel, and | note in an email response to her email about the conference, agin in 2008, | expressed that | would\npass her regards along to my wife and vice versa. When the University informed me of the complaint | was shocked and\n\nconcerned. When | spoke to the human resources person, including relating my concerns and providing the emails in question, | was\ntold that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was deemed to be warranted in this case, and that the young woman in question\nhad agreed to that. By that time | learned of the complaint | had already announced my intentions to leave Case to accept an offer at\nASU—a very difficult decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the University, and the excellent relations | had with\nmy colleagues there, both among the faculty and among the administration. Because | was already in Arizona at the time | was asked\nnot to have any further interaction with the student | agreed to that request because it was basically moot. | was also told that\nbecause it was being handled informally, that (a) it should remain confidential, which |, at least abided by, and (b) if no further\ncomplaints were lodged in that case, that the University would remove the allegation from my record after 5 years, which makes me\nsurprised that someone violated that written agreement with you.\n\nRe item 6: You report on ASU’s response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically stated there were never\nany allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and the outside complaints were in fact related\nspecifically to your item #6. Further you neglect to mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual\nwho was allegedly harassed, who never lodged a complain, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged transgression. |\nwas surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by both Universities that\nbecause of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private events unrelated to the University would be\ninvestigated. The complaint was investigated throughly by both ASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion that it was not\ncredible and no university policies had been violated. . In addition ANU’s investigation, which took a full month found significant\ninconsistencies in the allegation, suggesting distortion and fabrication, | will quote from the ANU report. The initial complaint, which in\nfact resulted in a temporary suspension by ANU outlined the claim you made in the words you quoted in your note to me, along with\nthe statement made in the complaint that\n\n\"It is the University’s understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the time of the incident.”\n\nAfter the investigation, the final report absolved me of any wrongdoing, and indicated information inconsistent with the original claim\nand apparent later claims as follows:\n\n“The allegations were made by an observer to the incident.\n\n- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched in\n\nan unwelcome manner.\n\n- The conference attendee who took the ‘selfie’ photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers\nat the time of the incident (November 2016).\n\n- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers\nat the time of the incident (November 2016).\n\nThe photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact.\n\n- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who took\nthe ‘selfie’ photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was requested\nin the course of the investigation.”\n\n(And for the record | often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as | specifically request selfies not to include flashes,\nso that | don’t end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half hour)\n\nWhat makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that | get asked for literally thousands of selfies, and when people come\nup to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, and sometimes overly aggressive. | am particularly proud of the way | attempt to make all\npeople feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated. Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what | am about, which is to\nacknowledge fans in a way that makes them feel appreciated. As | understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take\nselfies at the CFl conference in Las Vegas this year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed. Moreover, | am proud of the\ninteractions | have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff. | have had numerous female graduate students,\npostdocs, employees, and colleagues, and as ASU attested to you, none of these have ever complained of harassment.

When it\ncomes to compliance, there is no one-size-fits-all program.\nThus, the discussion below is meant to provide insight into\nthe aspects of compliance programs that DOJ and SEC\nassess, recognizing that companies may consider a variety\nof factors when making their own determination of what\nis appropriate for their specific business needs.>’° Indeed,\nsmall- and medium-size enterprises likely will have different\ncompliance programs from large multi-national corpora-\ntions, a fact DOJ and SEC take into account when evaluat-\ning companies’ compliance programs.\n\nCompliance programs that employ a “check-the-box”\napproach may be inefficient and, more importantly, ineffec-\ntive. Because each compliance program should be tailored\nto an organization's specific needs, risks, and challenges,\nthe information provided below should not be considered\na substitute for a company’s own assessment of the corpo-\nrate compliance program most appropriate for that particu-\nlar business organization. In the end, if designed carefully,\nimplemented earnestly, and enforced fairly, a company’s\ncompliance program—no matter how large or small the\norganization—will allow the company generally to prevent\nviolations, detect those that do occur, and remediate them\n\npromptly and appropriately.\n\nCommitment from Senior Management and a\nClearly Articulated Policy Against Corruption\nWithin a business organization, compliance begins\nwith the board of directors and senior executives setting\nthe proper tone for the rest of the company. Managers and\nemployees take their cues from these corporate leaders.\nThus, DOJ and SEC consider the commitment of corpo-\nrate leaders to a “culture of compliance”?! and look to see\nif this high-level commitment is also reinforced and imple-\nmented by middle managers and employees at all levels of\n\na business. A well-designed compliance program that is\n\nnot enforced in good faith, such as when corporate man-\nagement explicitly or implicitly encourages employees to\nengage in misconduct to achieve business objectives, will be\nineffective. DOJ and SEC have often encountered compa-\nnies with compliance programs that are strong on paper but\nthat nevertheless have significant FCPA violations because\nmanagement has failed to effectively implement the pro-\ngram even in the face of obvious signs of corruption. This\nmay be the result of aggressive sales staff preventing com-\npliance personnel from doing their jobs effectively and of\nsenior management, more concerned with securing a valu-\nable business opportunity than enforcing a culture of com-\npliance, siding with the sales team. The higher the financial\nstakes of the transaction, the greater the temptation for\nmanagement to choose profit over compliance.\n\nA strong ethical culture directly supports a strong\ncompliance program. By adhering to ethical standards,\nsenior managers will inspire middle managers to reinforce\nthose standards. Compliant middle managers, in turn, will\nencourage employees to strive to attain those standards\nthroughout the organizational structure?”\n\nIn short, compliance with the FCPA and ethical rules\nmust start at the top. DOJ and SEC thus evaluate whether\nsenior management has clearly articulated company stan-\ndards, communicated them in unambiguous terms, adhered\nto them scrupulously, and disseminated them throughout\n\nthe organization.\n\nCode of Conduct and Compliance Policies and\nProcedures\n\nA company’s code of conduct is often the foundation\nupon which an effective compliance program is built. As\nDOJ has repeatedly noted in its charging documents, the\nmost effective codes are clear, concise, and accessible to all\nemployees and to those conducting business on the com-\npany’s behalf. Indeed, it would be difficult to effectively\nimplement a compliance program if it was not available in\nthe local language so that employees in foreign subsidiaries\ncan access and understand it. When assessing a compliance\n\nprogram, DOJ and SEC will review whether the company\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022559\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

With long-term inflation breakevens closing on their historical\naverages (Chart 5), we think the next phase of the rates move will be led by the belly of\nthe curve. The market is only pricing in a one and a quarter rate hike in 2017, and\nanother one and a quarter hike in 2018, with Fed Funds futures implying that the Fed\nFunds rates will be only at 1.25% at the end of 2018 (Chart 6). We think the 5y part of\nthe curve offers the best risk-reward trade-off for investors with a 3-6 month horizon to\nposition for a more aggressive Fed.

Still, IG bonds will likely continue to\noutperform government bonds, offering low volatility and stable income.\n\n¢ We lower our spread target from 170bps to 140bps due to the improved global macro and risk\nenvironment after recent central bank action and the pickup in economic data. IG bonds remain\nsupported by our outlook for sluggish but positive global growth, ongoing investor appetite for income-\ngenerating assets, and expected negative net issuance.\n\n¢ Non-financial corporates: While total yields are at record lows, the pickup over government bonds and\nmoney market rates is still attractive. Aggressive re-leveraging by companies looks unlikely.\n\n¢ Financial corporates: Due to regulatory challenges, spreads are expected to remain above past averages.\nUS banks are in a more favorable position than their European peers as they are better capitalized and\nearnings have been strong recently. US financial spreads are thus likely to tighten further.\n\n4 Positive scenario Spread target (6-month): 130bps\n\n¢ Global growth accelerates more forcefully than expected.

Also, risks in the\nEurozone persist (e.g. Greek exit, Spain/Italy getting cut off from private funding).

This is a factor, and as you know in the\nprogram \"financial balance\" we had three scenarios for Oil which are: the pessimistic scenario S 45, the\naverage scenario or a baseline of S 50, and the optimistic scenario of S$ 55. This is not the Kingdom's\nassessment for oil, but this is to arrange our securities with different oil prices. In the first quarter, we\nwere close to the optimistic scenario which is $ 55, sometimes we go beyond it and sometimes we are\nless than, this is a positive element. The other positive element is that our non-oil revenues in the first\nquarter of 2017 have achieved more than we anticipate to achieve. This is another positive element, so\nthe decision is no longer has to continue in this manner. So that, it was reviewed as stated in the\nresolution itself, while we exaggerate that this is a very great success for the competent authorities in\nthe financial and the economic and investment sides as they were able to take us from this stage in less\nthan 8 months. The work of a very great effort has been done in the oil agreement with the OPEC\ncountries and non-OPEC countries is an agreement for the first time in history. We have always known in\nthe past that the agreements were held between the OPEC countries only, and this is the first time in the\nhistory that the agreement held between the OPEC countries and countries outside OPEC. That made\nour position is very positive in terms of the governmental revenues of the oil.

Also, do not know if our programs in our non-oil revenues will succeed or\nnot, we also do not know if that our investments will come to fruition in a short period of time or we\ncannot make a profit to help the government budget in a short period. So that, we can take “the risk” at\nthe expense of the national economy. These procedures have been done in the past, in the eighties and\nin 1997. But the difference between this period and the past periods is that we took a period of few\nmonths to went back to the normal position while in previous cases in our history and the history of\nother countries take years to return to normal course.\n\n* | mean the size of the amounts Was it affect the support?\n\n- without doubt.

(It also means that if you ever do\nS&M in a public space such as a dungeon, everyone in the place will recognize your\nsafeword if you scream it.)\n\nC) At first wasn't that excited about this, but I've grown to love the fact that the safeword\n\"red\" also sometimes encompasses \"green\" -- and \"yellow.\" That means that if I'm in the\nmiddle of an S&M encounter, I can say \"red\" and my partner will stop; I can then catch\nmy breath and say \"green,\" which means \"by God keep going!\" Or, if I'm a little\nuncertain about the territory but don't actually want my partner to stop -- if I just want my\npartner to be a little bit cautious -- then I can say \"yellow\" (and, of course, I can move to\n\"sreen” if I become really psyched, or shift to \"red\" if I really want my partner to stop).\n\nThomas MacAulay Millar:\n\nMy spouse and I use the \"stoplight system.\" It's simple, it works, and \"yellow\" option is\nreally useful for things that are getting hard to handle. Also, a lot of bottoms are either\nsubmissives or masochists with more pride and stubbornness than is good for them -- the\nformer out of an overdeveloped desire to please, the latter sometimes out of a desire to\nimpress or even just a pitbull-stubborn urge to push themselves as hard as they can go.\nTake the personalities that finish an Ironman and collapse and need IV fluids, and put\nthem on a spanking bench with big welts from a prison strap, and you've got someone\nwho won't safeword when ze probably should. In those and other circumstances, giving\nthe bottom an easy option to say, \"I'm struggling here\" without feeling like they're\nquitting is a very useful thing.\n\n[Editor's Note: \"ze\" is the gender-neutral pronoun, and it's in the Glossary.

Consider the\nfollowing example: during my last vacation to America, I had an S&M encounter with a\ndude I'll refer to as Klark. (It's not my fault. He requested the pseudonym.) At one point,\nKlark was experimenting with hurting me, and I had my eyes closed and was whimpering\n/ crying out in a totally glorious way. (The poor overnight desk clerk. He was only one\nshort flight of stairs away from us.) I think Klark was legitimately having trouble\ndetecting whether I was enjoying myself, though -- understandably, because we had only\njust met, and I enjoy sinking myself into dramatic masochistic misery -- so he leaned over\nme and said, in a low dark voice, \"Red, yellow, green.\" Immediately, I gasped back\n\"Green.\" Because he spoke in a gritty and dominant voice, and the check-in was quick,\nwe were able to maintain the mood -- and it was actually kind of hot in itself.\n\nWhich brings me to the other thing: check-ins. Sometimes, you want to check in with\nyour partner. Which can be easy: you can just say, \"Hey, how does this feel?\" or, as a\nmore precise example, \"Give me a rating of 1-10 on how good this feels (or how much\nthis hurts).\" But if you want to do it quickly and without shifting the mood, you can do it\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018468\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Monetary easing will give way to fiscal easing\n\nThe history of populism is one of fiscal largesse. Furthermore, with limited scope for\nfurther monetary easing, fiscal easing is becoming the last and only resort for\npolicymakers. It seems reasonable to assume that the combination of these two factors\nwill soon usher in a period of easier fiscal policy.\n\nNowhere will the impact of fiscal easing be felt more than the US in 2017, in our view.\nThe GOP has achieved a rare clean sweep in the latest elections. During the 18 years\nthat a single party controlled both the Presidency and Congress since 1965, US\nstructural budget balance as a share of potential GDP deteriorated by O.4pp a year on\naverage (Chart 3). In other words, history tells us that a clean sweep is usually a recipe\nfor fiscal stimulus. The GOP has the additional incentive to use fiscal easing to boost\neconomic growth ahead of the mid-term elections in 2018. The Republicans will need to\npick up at least eight more seats in the Senate to accomplish their stated objectives of\nrepealing Obamacare and Dodd-Frank (Chart 4). We think the Republican controlled\nCongress will use the reconciliation process (which has a deadline of 15 April} to pass\nmost of its fiscal agenda into law.\n\n2. Fiscal easing not yet priced into the belly of the curve\n\nFiscal easing is unlikely to be kind to the Treasury market. For one thing, a bigger\nbudget deficit would increase risk premium. And, fiscal easing at this late stage of the\nexpansion would likely lead investors to demand higher inflation risk premium.

This would thus imply that fiscal consolidation is likely to fall short of\nnarrowing imbalances materially without a sustained oil price recovery.\n\nThe fees on excess foreign worker quotas and the green-card like program targeted\nproceeds are difficult to reach, in our view. We calculate that to raise US$10bn from a\ngreen-card like program, authorities will need to set the program fees at US$1,500 (in\nline with upper bound of similar programs elsewhere) and have all expatriate workers\napplying to enrol in the program. This appears an unrealistic target to meet, particularly\nas it is not clear how these proceeds would be recurrent yearly. As for the foreign\nworker quotas proceeds, we calculate that, based on private sector expatriate figures\nand the stated 85% overall compliance with Nitaqat sector quotas, that the fees would\nneed to be set at a large cUSS10,500 per non-compliant worker to be consistent with\nthe NTP target. The large fee amount would likely be a material disincentive to private\nsector corporates and a squeeze on their profits.\n\nOne of the obstacles to meeting the subsidy reform target is likely to be political in\nnature given the impact on inflation and household incomes. We calculate nevertheless\nthat the target could be reached through a combination of a administered prices\nchanges. We do not think there is major room to increase natural gas feedstock prices\nto petrochemical firms, given the NTP focus on the petrochemical sector as a source of\nfuture growth. We estimate raising natural gas prices to US spot levels in an oil price\nenvironment of US$50/bblI would bring in revenues to the central government of just\nUS$2.5bn (0.4% of GDP) if fully passed to the budget. This is likely to suggest that the\nbulk of the future adjustments are likely to center on hikes to administered price\nadjustments for domestic crude oil sales, diesel and gasoline. Selling domestic crude at\nUS$25/bbl rather than an average of US$5.4/bbl would bring in US$20.8bn in revenues.\nGasoline and diesel prices could rise by the same percentage as in December 2015 to\nbring in additional revenues for a minimum inflation pick-up cost of O.5ppt.\n\nThe most difficult part would be meeting the US$40bn in other non-oil revenues target,\nin our view. Given that the latter’s breakdown was not provided, we have attempted to\ngroup several measures being studied (according to local press) to provide a tentative\ndecomposition. Still, our analysis suggests the need for a further US$16.8-US$20.7bn in\nfinancing to meet the US$40bn target. Land tax proceeds of US$11bn in the first phase\nof implementation are the largest item, in our view. We calculate that a 20% sin tax on\ntobacco and sugary drinks would raise US$2.1bn (0.3% of GDP) at a O.5ppt cost to\ninflation. A remittance tax being studied, according to local press, and could impose a\ntax of 6% gradually decline to 2% over a number of years. At the upper bound of the tax\nrate (6%), we calculate that the remittance tax would raise US$2.3bn (0.4% of GDP). We\ncalculate that a 10% income tax on expatriates would raise at least between US$3.9-\nUSS7.8bn (0.6-1.2% of GDP), depending on the assumed annual overall expatriate\nearnings. That being said, measures to tax expatriates could be detrimental to\ndiversification and labor force prospects and were opposed to politically in the past.\n\nOS Merrill Lynch GEMs Paper #26 |30 June 2016 21\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016131\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Far more important for financial markets in our view, especially for the rates\nand FX markets, is what tax reform means for inflation. The recent divergence between\ninflation breakevens and real yields reflects to a large part to the increasing consensus\nthat tax reform will be stagflationary.\n\nWe are less sure this will be the case and this is why. In our view, there are four possible\npaths in terms of how the border adjustment tax proposal could play out:\n\ne Scenario 1: This is the baseline of the Republican architects of the proposal\nwho see a 25% appreciation of the USD to offset the 20% new tax on imports.\nIn this scenario, because of the USD appreciation the inflationary impact of the\nborder adjustment tax will be limited. In fact, it is very likely in this scenario\nthat the second round effects of the USD appreciation (for example on\ncommodity prices and emerging markets) will stoke deflationary fears.\n\ne Scenario 2: In this scenario, we would get the BAT as proposed but the USD\ndoes not go up because the new administration sees a strong USD as\nincompatible with its trade policy. We suspect this scenario has become the\nbaseline for the market. We disagree this is the most probable outcome. In our\nview, it would be difficult if not impossible for Republican leadership to push\nthrough tax changes that would lead to potentially very unpopular price hikes\nahead of the mid-term elections next year.\n\ne Scenario 3: In this scenario the BAT would not make it into the tax reform and\nthe proposed corporate tax cut is financed by running up the fiscal deficit. This\ncould be easier to sell politically than Scenario 2, especially given that the\nRepublicans plan to deliver personal income tax cuts at the same time. In this\nscenario, the USD will rally as the Fed continues to hike and rate differential\ndrives the USD higher.\n\nChart 6: The four different fates of the border adjustment tax proposal\n\nScenario 1: Ryan-Brady proposal Medium probability:\n+25% USD increase = Little increase USD{ 17, BEL |\n\nin inflatian\n\nScenario 2: Ryan-Brady proposal + Low probability:\n\nlittle USD increase = Big increase in —_— USDt |, BET Tt\n\nInflatinn\n\nBAT\n\nScenario 3: No BAT + bigger fiscal Medium probability:\ndeficit = Little increase in inflation | USD?, BE|\n\nScenario 4: VAT instead of BAT = Medium probability:\n\n41\\\\\n\nSmaller increase in inflation > USD* 1, BET |\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n\nBankofAmerica <2”\n\n6 Cause and Effect | 13 February 2017 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014726\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The three least burly-looking of us\nwould go in as women: a boyish looking guy named Lonny Rafael, Amiram\nLevin, and me.\n\nStill, there was another, potentially deeper concern that had yet to be\naddressed. In all sayeret missions, since the beginning, we knew we might end\nup having to fight, shoot and, if necessary, kill. Yet now we would be going in\nwith the expectation of killing three specific men. We had black-and-white\nphotos: Mohammed Youssef al-Najar, or Abu Youssef, an operations officer in\nBlack September; Kamal Adwan, one of Arafat’s top military planners; and\nKamal Nasser, a member of his leadership circle and his spokesman.\nNominally, it was understood we would seize them and bring them back to\nIsrael if possible. I had us exercise how we’d do that. But none of us really\nbelieved that once our teams made it into the apartments, the Palestinians would\nsurrender. We assumed we would have no option but to kill them.\n\nThe killing was not the main issue. After all, I had drawn up a plan a year\nearlier to target Arafat himself. Though no one in the sayeret took any pleasure\nin having to take a life, at the end of the day we were a part of the army. Black\nSeptember, and Arafat’s Fatah more broadly, were not only at war with the\nexistence of Israel. They were behind a campaign of terror. Certainly there was\nno significant public opposition, after the horror of Munich, to going after those\nwho were deemed to be part of the operational or political direction of Black\nSeptember. Our uneasiness inside the unit, however, revolved around what I’d\nextolled as its “spirit” when I became commander. Beyond all the specific\nqualities we needed to succeed in our operations, our image of ourselves was as\nthinking soldiers. We might sometimes find it necessary to kill, but we were not\nkillers.\n\nAs I explained to each of the men I’d be leading on the operation, the\nMossad, Dado, and ultimately Golda had concluded that these three men were\nappropriate targets in the wake of Munich. As a battalion-level commander, I\ndid not feel I was in a position to challenge their judgement, unless we had been\nordered to carry out an attack that was clearly improper or immoral. In that case,\nI would have no hesitation in refusing. I said I viewed what we were being\nasked to do in Beirut not as an act of revenge, but a deterrent. It was a way of\nleaving no doubt in the minds of potential future terrorists that massacres like\nMunich carried a heavy price.\n\n138\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027986\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In addition to creating job opportunities\nthat contribute to solving many of the problems of Saudi citizens, as well as they contribute to the\ndevelopment of the private sector.\n\n* Among the programs that were presented last Sunday the housing program and there was a reference\nto three solutions. What is the vision of Your Highness through the program to the issue of housing?\n\n- We are optimistic and we expect the situation for us is more positive than we thought, there will be\nhundreds of thousands of free units in the housing program, there will also be more than one million\nunits in soft loans for Saudi citizens. The first will be without payment for hundreds of thousands of units\nand there is no specific number, and the accurate number will be announced at the time of the\nlaunching of the housing program, but there will undoubtedly be more than one million units sold by the\nfacilitator or loan from the Real Estate Development Fund, the Real Estate Development Fund will\ncontribute to lending and also the easy sale, the Public Investment Fund will also contribute to the\nhousing sector.\n\n* Will the fund return to its previous role in pumping money?\n\n- The Real Estate Development Fund is undoubtedly one of the main drivers of the development of the\nhousing sector. We have three types of housing. The first one is the free one, hundreds of thousands, |\ncannot give you the final number. The second one is the housing supported by the real estate\ndevelopment fund. Third one is the housing from the main investor which is the government and it sells\neasily and at a discounted price to the Saudi citizen. This is a very long-term loan whose profit to the\nfund is only 3%, while the citizen can own his unit on the second day and he can pay for many years\nwithout affecting his main income. Not to mention, the free units as large as possible to citizens who\ncannot cover the costs of housing programs.\n\n* When Your Highness is expected to start the project launch?\n\n- Imposed within 6 months, | do not expect it to be one of the first programs to be launched because it is\nvery complex and has very high spending, | expect it will be launched in the third quarter of 2017.\n\n* Your Highness the Prince, there is a fear haunt some economic writers about Aramco and that it is the\nproperty of the state and that it should not be offered for subscription opinion. What is your opinion?\n\n- | think that this thought tends to be communist socialist thought that everything must be owned by the\nstate even the bakery must be the property of the state. Fundamentally, there was an intention to put\nAramco on the market, and that had been stated in the main documents in which Aramco was\nestablished under the reign of King Abdul Aziz - may God have mercy on him — at that time. Today, you\nhave a very valuable company and you can keep this company in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, keep its\nimpacts in Saudi Arabia, and make it grow in Saudi Arabia, while benefiting from its value by stimulating\nother sectors that are not in Saudi Arabia. This will help us capture many opportunities like we spoke at\nthe beginning of the interview. If you did not put Aramco on the market means that we will continue 50\nyears or 40 years to develop the mining sector, it will take 40 years for us to develop local content, and it\nwill take years to develop logistics services, such as what we lost 40 years ago while we were trying to\ndevelop these sectors.

A \nfederal judge hearing the Justice Department's lawsuit to block the deal denied a \nrequest by the telecom giant to disclose communications between Justice Department \nofficials, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and the White House about the \ndeal. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020144 \n• Why it matters: The ruling is a blow to AT&T's attempt to show that the \nlawsuit to block the deal is politically motivated by President Trump's antipathy for \nCNN, which Time Warner owns. AT&T says it wasn't asked to offload any assets as \npart of the deal until after Trump took office. \n• What they're saying: \"We respect the judge's decision and look forward to \nthe upcoming trial,\" said Dan Petrocelli, who is leading AT&T and Time Warner's \ndefense in the case, in a statement. \n• At a hearing on Friday, a Justice Department lawyer said that AT&T's \nargument for the documents \"didn't make sense.\" \n• Go deeper: Our report from the courtroom on Friday, when DOJ and AT&T \npresented their arguments. \nFund scoop: Niv Dror, who joined AngelList through its acquisition of Product Hunt \nin 2016, is raising a small early-stage fund focused on consumer products, multiple \nsources tell Axios. Dror declined to comment. \n• The fund will raise at least $1 million, though one source says it could go up to \n$2-3 million. \n• Like Product Hunt colleague Ryan Hoover's own VC fund, Dror's will be \nmanaged on the back-end by AngelList. \nSame old story: Yesterday, I grabbed coffee with Day One Ventures founder Masha \nDrokova, and heard a familiar—and still disappointing—story: While raising her fund, \nshe was told by prospective investors that she should get a male co-founder. \n• She initially considered the suggestion, she told me, before remembering it's \nrooted in sexism. \nSoftbank $$$: Softbank's Vision Fund is in early talks to raise additional funds from \nBahrain's sovereign wealth fund, Mumtalakat, the latter's CEO told Reuters. \n• The Persian Gulf has been a major source of funds for the Vision Fund: Public \nInvestment Fund, Saudi Arabia's main sovereign wealth fund, and Abu Dhabi's \nMubadala, are already investors. \n• And it's not the only one visiting the region's investors—funds focused on tokens \nand cryptocurrencies have also been fundraising in the area, I'm told. \nUnicorn stampede: We're not even two months into 2018 and yet, seven startups \nhave already seen their private valuations cross the $1 billion mark—earning \"unicorn\" \nstatus—according to Pitchbook.

The move is a response to Qualcomm's \nannouncement yesterday it would pay $127.50 a share for NXP, up from the $ilo it \nhad offered. \n• Why it's the BFD: Broadcom and Qualcomm's takeover dance has taken a \ndramatic turn for what should have been a boring transaction between two chip \ncompanies. \n• Bottom line: \"Broadcom has long said its acquisition of the San Diego-based \nchipmaker is contingent on Qualcomm buying NXP at the previously agreed price, \nsaving a large amount of cash Broadcom could hypothetically use for its own purposes \nonce the acquisition goes through... Qualcomm raised its NXP bid to secure support \nfrom activist investors who have piled into NXP and demanded a higher sale price.\" — \nBloomberg. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020146 \nVim? \nffintr. \nVenture Capital Deals \n• Moovit, an Israeli maker of a transportation app, has raised $50 million in Series D \nfunding led by Intel Capital, with participation from Sequoia, BMW iVentures, NGP, \nSound Ventures, BRM, Gemini, Vaizra, Vintage, and Hanaco. http://axioslink/fQSW \n• Vectra, a San Jose, Calif.-based cybersecurity startup, has raised $36 million in \nSeries D funding led by Atlantic Bridge, with participation from the Ireland \nStrategic Investment Fund, Nissho Electronics Corp., Khosla Ventures, Accel Partners, \nIA Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, DAG Ventures and Wipro Ventures. www.vectra.ai  \n• FourKites, a Chicago-based make of supply chain management software, has raised \n$35 million in Series B funding.

In addition, compliance programs that do not just\nexist on paper but are followed in practice will inevitably\nuncover compliance weaknesses and require enhancements.\nConsequently, DOJ and SEC evaluate whether companies\nregularly review and improve their compliance programs\nand not allow them to become stale.\n\nAccording to one survey, 64% of general counsel whose\ncompanies are subject to the FCPA say there is room for\nimprovement in their FCPA training and compliance pro-\ngrams.>* An organization should take the time to review and\ntest its controls, and it should think critically about its poten-\ntial weaknesses and risk areas. For example, some companies\nhave undertaken employee surveys to measure their compli-\nance culture and strength of internal controls, identify best\npractices, and detect new risk areas. Other companies period-\nically test their internal controls with targeted audits to make\ncertain that controls on paper are working in practice. DOJ\nand SEC will give meaningful credit to thoughtful efforts\nto create a sustainable compliance program if a problem is\nlater discovered. Similarly, undertaking proactive evaluations\nbefore a problem strikes can lower the applicable penalty\nrange under the US. Sentencing Guidelines.” Although the\nnature and the frequency of proactive evaluations may vary\ndepending on the size and complexity ofan organization, the\nidea behind such efforts is the same: continuous improve-\n\nment and sustainability”\n\nMergers and Acquisitions: Pre-Acquisition Due\nDiligence and Post-Acquisition Integration\n\nIn the context of the FCPA, mergers and acquisi-\ntions present both risks and opportunities. A company\nthat does not perform adequate FCPA due diligence prior\nto a merger or acquisition may face both legal and business\nrisks.” Perhaps most commonly, inadequate due diligence\ncan allow a course of bribery to continue—with all the\nattendant harms to a business’s profitability and reputation,\nas well as potential civil and criminal liability.\n\nIn contrast, companies that conduct effective FCPA\ndue diligence on their acquisition targets are able to evalu-\nate more accurately each target’s value and negotiate for the\n\ncosts of the bribery to be borne by the target. In addition,\n\nGuiding Principles\nof Enforcement\n\nsuch actions demonstrate to DOJ and SEC a company’s\ncommitment to compliance and are taken into account\nwhen evaluating any potential enforcement action. For\nexample, DOJ and SEC declined to take enforcement\naction against an acquiring issuer when the issuer, among\nother things, uncovered the corruption at the company\nbeing acquired as part of due diligence, ensured that the\ncorruption was voluntarily disclosed to the government,\ncooperated with the investigation, and incorporated the\nacquired company into its compliance program and inter-\nnal controls. On the other hand, SEC took action against\nthe acquired company, and DOJ took action against a sub-\nsidiary of the acquired company.**® When pre-acquisition\ndue diligence is not possible, DOJ has described proce-\ndures, contained in Opinion Procedure Release No. 08-02,\npursuant to which companies can nevertheless be rewarded\nif they choose to conduct thorough post-acquisition FCPA\ndue diligence”\n\nFCPA due diligence, however, is normally only a\nportion of the compliance process for mergers and acquisi-\ntions. DOJ and SEC evaluate whether the acquiring com-\npany promptly incorporated the acquired company into all\nof its internal controls, including its compliance program.\nCompanies should consider training new employees, reeval-\nuating third parties under company standards, and, where\nappropriate, conducting audits on new business units.\n\nFor example, as a result of due diligence conducted\nby a California-based issuer before acquiring the majority\ninterest in a joint venture, the issuer learned of corrupt pay-\nments to obtain business. However, the issuer only imple-\nmented its internal controls “halfway” so as not to “choke\nthe sales engine and cause a distraction for the sales guys.”\nAs a result, the improper payments continued, and the\nissuer was held liable for violating the FCPA’s internal con-\n\ntrols and books and records provisions.>*°\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022564\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Was it that nothing less drastic than the bruises he'd left could have forced my\nunderstanding? Was it simply that I'd been romantically unhappy at the time, whereas I'd\nbeen content when that other man pinned me to the floor? Even in the midst of my now-\nconstant confusion, I couldn't stop myself from analyzing it all to bits. Now I concluded\nthat I ought to know how I felt about Richard if 1 wanted to get to the roots of myself.\n\nIt had taken me a while to call my openly-BDSM friends for advice, but -- maybe around\nthe same time I really started acclimating -- I had.

Peg\n\n----- Original Message -----\n\nFrom: Peggy Siegal\n\nSent: Thursday, March 07, 2013 08:51 AM\nTo: Peggy Siegal\n\nSubject: Oscar Diary\n\nIt's Thursday morning on Wilshire Boulevard and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has just\nopened it's doors for ticket pick-up for the 85th Oscar telecast.\n\nForty voting members, the distinguished director Norman Jewison and I are on a long single file line that\nsnakes thru the lobby patiently waiting to go upstairs to pick up our tickets. My seats were awarded via\na lottery system. we clutch our photo I.D.\n\nSuddenly, a messenger slips in wearing a smart khaki windbreaker and cuts through the line. He announces\nto the uniformed guard in a stage whisper, \"Dreamworks\", and as if Steven Spielberg himself had just\ndelivered the Gettysburg address, is ushered upstairs.\n\nThat is the final act of social justice of the \"Lincoln\" campaign.\n\nI am sleep deprived and jet lagged having just spent six hours on a flight sitting next Paula Wagner who\nis Tom Cruise's ex-agent turned Broadway producer for Jessica Chastain's \"The Heiress\". We discuss\nJessica's not so great chances to beat Jennifer Lawrence for Best Actress. I mention Harvey Weinstein's\nconcern about Emmanuel Riva's last minute surge. The French phenomena doesn't speak English, has never\nbeen to L.A. and it's like voting for a ghost, even on her 86th birthday.\n\nThis is the year I got phone calls in September from top studio executives announcing each are winning\nthe Oscar. Their euphoric giddiness is due to the quality of the films resulting in the priciest oscar\ncampaigns on record and astounding audience support at the theaters.\n\nSeven of the nine best picture nominees have taken in well over $100 million at the domestic box office\nto date, but it's the worldwide numbers in the millions that are staggering.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox's “Life of Pi\" caused a tsunami at $595,\n\nUniversal's “Les Miserables\" scored $412, the Weinstein Cos.’ \"Django Unchained\" whipped up $395,\nDreamworks’ “Lincoln\" delivered at $254, warner's \"Argo\" captured $219, Weinstein's “Silver Lining\nPlaybook\" danced to $187 and Sony's \"Zero Dark Thirty\" killed at $107 million.\n\nIn comparison, Sony Classics’ \"Amour\" received $19 and Fox Searchlights' “Beast of the Southern wild”\nworked up $19 million.\n\nHugh audiences having actually seen the films this year have an ear for the nuances of the Oscar race and\neveryone including Ben Affleck follow the bloggers religiously.\n\nSo by Thursday morning on line at the Academy the informed buzz was as follows: \"Argo\" takes best\npicture because is was most entertaining. The director snub to Ben Affleck was a Godsend as George\nClooney's advice came from far away Berlin where he was in pre-production on “The Monuments Men\".\nWarner's president Sue Kroll kept the campaign clean and calm on the home front.\n\n“Lincoln's” victory is Daniel Day Lewis from day one of shooting, no pun intended. The suggestion that\nObama is our answer to Lincoln was interesting. Voters knew Obama secretly hosted three screenings in the\nwhite House, but they weren't invited. The Hollywood Foreign press were the biggest winners with Bill\nClinton's surprise appearance on their broadcast. Dreamworks’ ran an impeccable patriotic campaign that\nthe media ate up.\n\nThe best director race had the most drama. Hollywood dreaded Spielberg loosing to Ang Lee. (Eventually\neveryone was thrilled Steven was anointed president of the Cannes Jury for 2013 the day after the awards\nshow. )\n\nThe voters knew beloved Ang Lee's three year boat ride was the technical miracle. Fox's $595 million\ninternational box office blew in the win.\n\nHarvey Weinstein having three horses running is always the most talked about. His loquacious Quentin\nTarentino was a lock for screenplay. Best supporting actor was a total toss up with a sentimental edge\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019465\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Losing genes and losing\n\nparasites retreat until their time comes again.\n\nSummary\n\nThis chapter trades my wannabe economist hat for my wannabe biologist one.\nHerbert Spencer called those fields the same at bottom. I never read Spencer, and\nknow him mostly from Bertrand Russell’s books on the history of philosophy.\nSpencer rates a subchapter there. Yet he was an autodidact with less training in\neither field than mine. He even had less training in philosophy than mine. He was a\nphilosopher all the same, by Russell’s tough standards, and knew that logic comes\nfirst. Data eventually prove their worth when it’s time to test. The data I’ve found\nfits net generation theory more or less. What I really have on, all the while, is my\n\nwannabe philosopher hat.\n\nPopperians make no sense. Are we supposed to find that a rose is not a rose? Or that\nall reasoning from definition is as transparent as that example? Wiles’ proof of\nFermat’s last theorem ended a search that took some pretty bright minds three\ncenturies. My best guess would be that Popperians confuse the concepts of logic and\nquestion-begging. They are opposite. Logic (reasoning from definition) means\ntaking out no more than you put in. Truism or tautology usually means obvious\nexamples of the same, but sometimes includes subtle ones too. Question-begging\n\nmeans taking out what you never put in’.\n\n? Circularity is question-begging which claims to take out as inference what it put in as assumption.\nAssumption that Socrates is a man and that all men are mortal does not confirm that Socrates is a\nman. It confirms that Socrates is mortal if assumptions are sound.\n\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 28\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011087\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This race for mastery is a sprint, one that heads ever deeper into\nthe depths of a vulnerable system. The closer you are to the very core of a computer\nprogram or a network, the more control you have. Real mastery of the heart of a\nsystem would be like having a spy win the Presidency, turning the whole US\ngovernment into a “Weird Machine”. That prize of immediate, high-level and totally\n“trusted” access remains the Warez Dude gold standard. 18\n\nThe most dangerous - and therefore the most alluringly valuable — of these sorts of\nattacks, are known as “zero-day” exploits. The danger they represent only becomes\napparent at some awful instant, “Day Zero”, when they are revealed to have been\nrunning wild inside some hapless network or machine. That first moment in the\nknowledge of the bug is like day zero in a cancer diagnosis, and it begins an\nimmediate race to find and deliver a cure. Such completely unknown, secret\nvulnerabilities are fissures in the walls of computers that their manufacturers,\nsystem engineers, and security experts usually don’t realize are there. The dream of\nhackers and spies and greedy Warez Dudes is a version of this trick called an\n“Advanced Persistent Threat” - hidden, back-door access to a machine that endures\neven for years, through upgrades and security checks and system cleanups, all the\nwhile forcing the now-weird computer to do things its user won’t even be aware of:\nSend a copy of every keystroke to another machine, for instance, or serve as a\nrobotic launching pad for attacks on other machines. All while acting like a perfectly\nnormal machine.\n\nThe best of the zero day exploits are based not on the idea of sneaking malicious\nsoftware onto machines so much as on taking existing, trusted code and finding tiny\nholes that can be blasted into giant, insecure data tunnels. These tools for\nmanipulation are digital opiates, in a sense, for connected nervous systems. Such\nattacks often rely on errors already knit into computer systems, or innocent\nseeming features that can be made dangerous. Every computer and software\ndesigner knows their systems are vulnerable. Mathematicians have proven you can\nnever be absolutely sure a connected machine is safe. A mobile phone, for instance,\ncontains nearly 30 million lines of code. The systems that run massive cloud\ncomputing basins like those at Google or Amazon are even larger, updated every\nday, and have to cope with unprecedented flows of data at very high speeds. Even\nexpert programmers will leave four or five errors in every million lines of code.139\n\n138 That prize: Sergey Bratus, Julian Bangert, Alexandar Gabrovsky, Anna Shubina,\nDaniel Bilar, and Michael E.

Other\nminds likewise tend to be relatively\ninvisible unless attention is specifically\ndrawn to them. For instance, take a\nmoment to think about how happy you\nare compared to the average American...\nNo really, please take a moment...If you\njust spent some time thinking about how\nhappy you are and no time thinking\nabout how happy the average American\nis, then you are no different from the\nmajority of people in psychology\nexperiments who do likewise*. People\ncan consider others’ thoughts, feelings,\nbeliefs, or emotions, but doing so\nrequires mental effort that is in short and\nlimited supply. Consider, for instance, a\nsimple experiment in which you are\nplaying a game with another person’.\nBoth you and the other player in this\ngame must first choose privately to\ncooperate or compete with each other. If\nyou both choose to cooperate, you both\nearn $5. But if the other player chooses\nto cooperate and you choose to compete,\nthen you win $10 and your partner gets\nnothing. If you, however, choose to\ncooperate and the other player chooses\nto compete, you win nothing and your\npartner wins $10. If you both choose to\ncompete, you both win a measly $2. It\nseems obvious in this situation that you\nshould consider both what you would\nlike to do, but also consider what the\nother player is likely to be thinking.\nExperimental evidence suggests that\npeople do indeed think about the former\nbut spend little time thinking of the\nlatter. In a basic version of this\nexperiment, 60% of people chose to\ncooperate. However, when people were\nsimply asked to think about their\n\nPage | 96\n\npartner’s thoughts before making their\nchoice, only 27% chose to cooperate. If\npeople had already been thinking about\nothers’ thoughts, as it seems like they\nwould naturally be doing in this\nsituation, then a simple instruction to\nconsider others’ thoughts would have no\neffect on people’s own behavior. That is\nnot the case. This simple experiment\nshows that people may not naturally\nconsider other minds even when it\nappears that they should. Thinking\nabout other minds requires attentional\neffort. It does not necessarily come\nautomatically. Indeed, as Tanya\nLuhrmann describes in her chapter,\npeople may have to work very hard to\ndiscern other minds, such as the mind of\nGod, even when they are actively\nlooking for them.\n\nSeeking. If seeing other minds\nrequires attention, then other minds are\nespecially likely to become visible when\npeople are motivated to think about\nthem. There are many reasons why\npeople might try to get into the mind of\nanother agent, from a spouse to a pet to a\ngod, but two are reasonably well-\nsupported by existing research. First,\npeople tend to think about other minds\nwhen they are trying to form a social\nconnection with others. '° Making\npeople feel lonely or isolated, for\ninstance, increases the tendency to\ndescribe one’s pet as thoughtful,\nconsiderate, or sympathetic (all mindful\ntraits). And those who are made to feel\nlonely are also likely to report believing\nin mindful supernatural agents, such as\nGod. Second, people tend to think about\nother minds when they are trying to\nachieve some understanding and control\nover their environment or over another\nagent’s behavior.’ Concepts of mind,\nincluding attitudes, beliefs, goals, or\ndesires, can provide compelling cause-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021342\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

They should, Postel\nfelt, be good at handling lots of different types of communications - they should be\n“robust” — but they should also be careful not to spread too much non-standard\ngarbage out into the networks. This was an essential advance over the old ARPANET\nPaul Baran had helped inspire. That system worked wonderfully by itself, in\nisolation, as it sent humming nuclear launch codes zipping around, but it struggled\nwhen it needed to interoperate with other networks. It wasn’t generous. The\nInternet that Postel and others were designing was intended to be much, much\nlarger than ARPANET, so an ability to speak to others and be understood was\nessential. It was like planning an airport: You wanted to be able to land lots of\ndifferent types of planes. But if someone started throw golf balls, jello and gasoline\non the runway you'd have a problem. It would slow down the system for everyone.\nPostel was telling engineers: Be careful what you do and what you put onto the\nsystem. Take responsibility on your end. Build something that’s generous in what it\nwill handle from others.\n\nBe liberal in what you accept. From the first moments on the grass in Lelystad, the\nsmall town just outside Amsterdam where the Hacking At the End of the Universe\nconference gathered, the mad diversity that this idea suggested was an astonishing,\ndelightful fact. As broad and strange a group as Rop’s email had hinted might come\nwas in fact there, under the trees, happily running cables from tent to RV, powering\ntheir connected routers with gas-fired generators, marveling at data transmission\nspeeds that today, your phone might manage from an underground garage with the\nbarest connectivity. The two-day outdoor festival was an example of human\ninteroperability. Postel’s Principle brought to life. Few of us knew most of the group.\nNearly everyone was, well, not the most social. But there was instant connection,\ndiscussion, board gaming, and a degree of frank interoperating I’d never quite seen\nbefore. It was a harbinger of two decades of digital cross connection yet to come.\n\nOf all the people at the Hacktic conference, however, among the system managers\nand Unix gurus and heating system guerillas (hey, everyone should have a hobby), it\nwas the Warez Dudes who were of the most interest - both to the participants in the\nconference and to the white vans cruising nearby, allegedly filled with curious Dutch\npolice. The nickname came from the “wares” they had access to, which were largely\ncracked open versions of commercial software that could be shared and distributed\nand manipulated on private bulletin board systems. The Warez Dudes were pirates.\nAnd like most pirates they had an early sense of the very edges of the law and of the\nsmell of money drifting along new and essential routes. If hacker culture was, in\nthose early days, a frontier society - and it was, even down to the sad shortage of\nsingle women - these were the people living on the very furthest edges of the\n\n131 “Be conservative”: Jon Postel “DOD Standard Transmission Control Protocol”\n(1980) RFC 761, IED 129\n\n94\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018326\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Table $1 lists the fraction removed at\nthis stage for our other non-English corpora.\n\nI1.1D. Year Restriction\n\nIn order to further ensure publication date accuracy and consistency of dates across all our corpora, we\nimplemented a publication year restriction and only retained books with publication years starting from\n1550 and ending in 2008. We found that a significant fraction of mis-dated books have a publication year\nof 0 or dates prior to the invention of printing. The number of books filtered due to this year range\nrestriction is considerably small, usually under 2% of the original number of books.\n\nThe fraction of the corpus removed by all stages of the filtering is summarized in Table $1. Note that\nbecause the filters are applied in a fixed order, the statistics presented below are influenced by the\nsequence in which the filters were applied. For example, books that trigger both the OCR quality filter and\nby the language correction filter are excluded by the OCR quality filter, which is performed first. Of course,\nthe actual subset of books filtered is the same regardless of the order in which the filters are applied.\n\nI].2. Metadata based subdivision of the Google Books Collection\n\nII.2A. Determination of language\n\nTo create accurate corpora in particular languages that minimize cross-language contamination, it is\nimportant to be able to accurately associate books with the language in which they were written. To\ndetermine the language in which a text is written, we rely on metadata derived from our 100 bibliographic\nsources, as well as statistical language determination using the Popat algorithm (Ref $3). The algorithm\ntakes advantage of the fact that certain character sequences, such as ‘the’, 'of, and ‘ion\", occur more\nfrequently in English. In contrast, the sequences '‘la', 'aux', and ‘de’ occur more frequently in French.\nThese patterns can be used to distinguish between books written in English and those written in\nFrench. More generally, given the entire text of a book, the algorithm can reliably classify the book into\none of the 32 supported language types. The final consensus language was determined based on the\nmetadata sources as well as the results of the statistical language determination algorithm, with the\nstatistical algorithm as the higher priority.\n\nII.2B. Determination of book subject assignments\n\nBook subject assignments were determined using a book's Book Industry Standards and Communication\n(BISAC) subject categories. BISAC subject headings are a system for categorizing books based on\ncontent developed by the BISAC subject codes committee overseen by the Book Industry Study Group.\nThey are often used for a variety of purposes, such as to determine how books are shelved in stores. For\nEnglish, 92.4% of the books had at least one BISAC subject assignment. In cases where there were\nmultiple subject assignments, we took the more commonly used subject heading and discarded the rest.\n\nII.2C. Determination of book country-of-publication\n\nCountry of publication was determined on the basis of our 100 bibliographic sources; 97% of the books\nhad a country-of-publication assignment. The country code used is the 2 letter code as defined in the /SO\n3166-1 alpha-2 standard. More specifically, when constructing our US versus British English corpora, we\nused the codes \"us\" (United States) and \"gb\" (Great Britain) to filter our volumes.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017015\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Writing from this perspective,\nhe argued that the universe is a cosmic\nsociety organized under the leadership of\na King of kings, a society against which\nhumans have rebelled and, as a\nconsequence, humans are at risk of\nannihilation except for the mercy of the\nKing. Judgment day will come,\naccording to Edwards, and those who\nhave failed to meet their moral\nresponsibility to the directive of the\nuniverse face eternal isolation. Clark\nGilpin notes that by conjuring up a\npersonified God — a God with emotions,\nintentions, and the capacity to act —\nEdwards instilled great fear and\ntrembling in his listeners that\npresumably motivated them to change\ntheir behaviors in the desired direction.\nIt is hard to imagine that Edwards would\nhave had comparable success had he\nresorted to simple instructions or\nexhortations to engage in certain\nbehaviors and avoid others. The innate\ntendency of people to understand divine\nentities in terms of what people do\nunderstand, namely their own thoughts,\nfeelings, and beliefs, provided the\nleverage on which Edwards relied to\ndrive his message home.\n\nTanya Luhrmann also discusses a\npersonalized construction of God — a\nGod with whom one can consult and\nwho intervenes in one’s daily life.\nPeople are intrinsically motivated to\nform social connections, and very little\nin life is more rewarding to people than\ntheir social relationships. Luhrmann,\nwho adopts the perspective of a\nparticipant observer, finds that a new\nevangelical Protestant movement, the\nVineyard Church, appeals to this\n\nPage |110\n\nmotivation to depict God as one’s\npersonal guide and friend, well within\none’s sensory reach. By conjuring up an\nanthropomorphic God with loving\nemotions, intentions, and actions, the\nVineyard Church creates a desire for a\npersonal relationship with God. But\ndeveloping a relationship with an\ninvisible God defies rationality. People\nmust learn how to transform an abstract\nconcept of an invisible God into a\nconcrete sensory presence in their lives.\nJust as the social brain can perceive\nnonhuman objects as human, the social\nbrain is also capable of selectively\nattending to sensory experiences and\ninterpreting these sensations as God’s\npresence.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021356\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It\nwould offer the aggregate return and risk of the publicity-traded corporate sector as\nif it had never borrowed or issued debt. Aggregate means average. No one is exactly\naverage. Some like me and my father happen to be more risk-tolerant, and opt for\nthe higher returns that tend to come from higher risk. Some prefer the opposite.\n\nHow can the omnibus fund attract both?\n\nThe answer is derivatives. Derivatives are obligations whose benefits depend on\noutcomes imperfectly foreseen. I said in the forward that I’m all in favor of them so\nlong as we respect and manage the risks. Equities themselves are the classical\nexample. Mortgage-backed securities give another. Common forms include futures\nand swaps. The idea is about the same. Each typically picks an index, often the S&P\n500. One party, the “short leg”, bets so much money, the “notional amount”, that the\nS&P 500 index will go down tomorrow. Another party, the “long leg”, bets it will go\nup. The short leg gets so much, say Libor plus 20 basis points (hundredths of a\npercent) of the notional amount, in any outcome. The long leg gets the index change,\n\nwhether up or down, times the same notional amount.\n\nNo one actually invests the notional amount. It is called “notional” for good reason.\nRather each side (leg) commits a cash reserve, held by the firm managing the swap\nor future, in this case the omnibus fund itself, of 20% of the notional amount. The\nreserve is drawn down to meet payments required when market swings are averse,\nand replenished when favorable. When it falls to 10% of the notional amount, it is\nconsidered unsafe and the swap or future ends prematurely. Parties are warned,\n\nand new reserves can be committed in time.\nMonitoring of the reserve is continuous during market hours. Whenever the reserve\n\nfalls to 10%, even in the middle of the day, the account is closed immediately. This\n\ndiscipline keeps the other party safe.\n\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 4\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011093\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Objective: an alliance between\nright-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections\n\nNEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru who\nwas Donald Trump’s right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following the\nracist violence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the Daily\nBeast himself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (Il Movimento), right in the heart\nof Europe and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the\nEuropean elections which will be held in spring 2019.\n\nObjective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor of\nthe Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in support\nof NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist right,\naccused of plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to\nhave labour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the\nInterior Matteo Salvini.\n\nThe ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in\nthe European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and\nRome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great “populist international” of which he\nhas long since been dreaming.\n\nThe Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic\nadvice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European\nmovements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling\nfunding.\n\nThe aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of “super group” that if victorious can conquer up to a\nthird of the European Parliament in the elections next May.\n\nIndeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The\nAmerican strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress\n— and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data\nstolen from Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump emerged\nvictor. It is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West.\nAnd he has already met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and the\nformer leader of the British separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on Friday\nin Pennsylvania, USA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. Without\nforgetting the Italians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: \"If it works in Italy, we can import the\nmodel anywhere”.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019317\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Under her gaze, plates of finger sandwiches are delivered to Epstein and guests by the\nmenservants in white gloves.\n\nUpstairs, to the right of a spiral staircase, is the “office,” an enormous gallery spanning the width\nof the house. Strangely, it holds no computer. Computers belong in the “computer room” (a\nsmaller room at the back of the house), Epstein has been known to say. The office features a\ngilded desk (which Epstein tells people belonged to banker J. P. Morgan), 18th-century black\nlacquered Portuguese cabinets, and a nine-foot ebony Steinway “D” grand. On the desk, a\npaperback copy of the Marquis de Sade’s Zhe Misfortunes of Virtue was recently spotted.\nCovering the floor, Epstein has explained, “is the largest Persian rug you’ll ever see in a private\nhome—so big, it must have come from a mosque.” Amid such splendor, much of which reflects\nthe work of the French decorator Alberto Pinto, who has worked for Jacques Chirac and the\nroyal families of Jordan and Saudi Arabia, there is one particularly startling oddity: a stuffed\nblack poodle, standing atop the grand piano. “No decorator would ever tell you to do that,”\nEpstein brags to visitors. “But I want people to think what it means to stuff a dog.” People can’t\nhelp but feel it’s Epstein’s way of saying that he always has the last word.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn addition to the town house, Epstein lives in what is reputed to be the largest private dwelling\nin New Mexico, on an $18 million, 7,500-acre ranch which he named “Zorro.” “It makes the\ntown house look like a shack,” Epstein has said. He also owns Little St. James, a 70-acre island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, where the main house is currently being renovated by Edward Tuttle,\na designer of the Amanresorts. There is also a $6.8 million house in Palm Beach, Florida, and a\nfleet of aircraft: a Gulfstream IV, a helicopter, and a Boeing 727, replete with trading room, on\nwhich Epstein recently flew President Clinton, actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey,\nsupermarket magnate Ron Burkle, Lew Wasserman’s grandson, Casey Wasserman, and a few\nothers, on a mission to explore the problems of AIDS and economic development in Africa.\n\nEpstein is charming, but he doesn’t let the charm slip into his eyes. They are steely and\ncalculating, giving some hint at the steady whir of machinery running behind them. “Let’s play\nchess,” he said to me, after refusing to give an interview for this article. “You be white. You get\nthe first move.” It was an appropriate metaphor for a man who seems to feel he can win no\nmatter what the advantage of the other side. His advantage is that no one really seems to know\nhim or his history completely or what his arsenal actually consists of. He has carefully\nengineered it so that he remains one of the few truly baffling mysteries among New York’s\nmoneyed world. People know snippets, but few know the whole.\n\n“He’s very enigmatic,” says Rosa Monckton, the former C.E.O. of Tiffany & Co. in the U.K. and\na close friend since the early 1980s. “You think you know him and then you peel off another ring\nof the onion skin and there’s something else extraordinary underneath. He never reveals his\nhand.... He’s a classic iceberg. What you see is not what you get.”\n\nEven acquaintances sense a curious dichotomy: Yes, he lives like a “modern maharaja,” as Leah\nKleman, one of his art dealers, puts it. Yet he is fastidiously, almost obsessively private—he lists\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017773\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

She hadn’t seen it until a week afterwards. She said that\nof course she would have come with me. She felt angry with herself, and with\nme too, for not simply having phoned. But since I didn’t contact her in the\nweeks that followed, she figured this was just another one of our times apart. Or\n“stupid pride”. A few months later, I heard she was engaged to be married, to a\nyoung man she’d known since their high school days at the Alliance.\n\nI had first met Nava Cohen, the woman I would go on to marry, the previous\nyear. It was through another Cohen, though they were not related: Nechemia,\nmy sayeret friend who was killed in the 1967 war. He invited me to Tel Aviv\nfor a party in the spring, on the Jewish holiday of Purim, and introduced us.\nNava was just nineteen, five years younger than me. I was struck not just by the\nfact she was attractive, but by her poise, warm-heartedness, and her obvious\nintelligence. But she had her boyfriend with her, and I still saw myself and Nili\nas life partners. Now, she was beginning her studies at Hebrew University as\nwell, and, in a way, it was again Nechemia\n\nCohen who brought us together. Since his death, those of us who knew him\nfrom the sayeret had been looking for a fitting way to remember and to honor\nhim. We finally decided to set up a living memorial in his name: a Moadon\nSayarim, a center to train young people from all over Jerusalem in scouting and\nnavigation. We spent six months getting it up and running, and Nava pitched in\nwith the work.\n\nIt wasn’t until a few months after I heard of Nili’s engagement that I finally\nasked her on a date. We were in the university library, which had a space where\nyou could listen to tapes through headphones. I would go to hear classical\nmusic. Nava was studying English literature, and I’d sometimes see her there,\nengrossed in recordings of Shakespeare with the text of Hamlet or Macbeth in\nfront of her. Since I wasn’t shackled by the need to follow the alacks and\nalasses, I read the newspaper as the music washed over me. I turned to the\nmovie section. I circled three films, drew a question mark in the margin and\npassed it to her. She looked puzzled for a second. Then she smiled and put a\ncheckmark next to one of them.\n\nWhile we came from different backgrounds, the gap was narrower than it\nhad been with Nili. Her parental home was in Tiberias.

I listened raptly to\nXi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC\nCentral Committee, when he delivered his\nnew-era-defining report. I heard the\namendment to the Party Constitution that\nenshrined “Xi Jinping Thought on Social-\nism with Chinese Characteristics for a New\nEra”. I watched members of the new Stand-\ning Committee of the Political Bureau of the\nCPC Central Committee walk out on stage. I\nwas awed by the presence of the leadership,\npast and present. And I was overawed by\nXi’s grand vision for China and the country’s\nincreasing, radiating confidence. Most of all,\nI marveled at the remarkable and historic\ntransformation of China, which means so\nmuch to the Chinese people and which in\nthis new era will mean so much to the rest\nof the world.\n\nHaving departed the Great Hall of the\nPeople, I reflected how I, an American,\nfound myself caught up in the welling Chi-\nnese patriotism of the 19th CPC National\nCongress. Certainly, I was experiencing first-\nhand this inflection point in Chinese histo-\nry, when China envisions itself becoming a\nfully modernized country and taking pro-\nactive part in international affairs, and\nregaining its leading seat at the high table of\ngreat nations.\n\nWhat have I just witnessed? Following are\nsome personal observations.\n\nAgeneral consensus describes four pri-\nmary outcomes of the 19th Party Congress:\nXi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chi-\nnese Characteristics for a New Era; a new\n“contradiction” that defines China’s princi-\npal social challenge; a China that takes “cen-\nter stage in the world”; and the Party\nenhancing its leadership of society, includ-\ning maintaining, indeed intensifying, its\nanti-corruption campaign.\n\nTo me, however, a highlight was the speci-\nficity of Xi’s vision of China, not only estab-\nlishing policies for the next five years, but also\nframing the agenda and setting the strategies\nfor the next 30 years. This congress, Xi said, is\nthe “confluence” of the “Iwo Centenary\nGoals”: a moderately prosperous society by\n2020 (2021 being the 100th anniversary of\nthe CPC), which will likely be fulfilled within\nthe term of the 19th Party Congress, and a\ngreat, modern, socialist country by 2050\n(2049 being the 100th anniversary of the Peo-\nple’s Republic of China), which is being\nplanned by the 19th Party Congress.\n\nIna multi-meaning refinement, the path\nto mid-century is now designed in two sta-\nges. In the first stage, from 2020 to 2035, the\nParty states it will build on the foundation of\nthe moderately prosperous society such that,\nafter “15 years of hard work’; the country will\nbasically realize “socialist modernization’:\n\nInthe second stage, from 2035 to 2050, the\nCPC states it will build on a basically achieved\nmodernization, “work hard for a further 15\nyears” and “develop China into a great mod-\nern socialist country that is prosperous,\nstrong, democratic, culturally advanced, har-\nmonious, and beautiful’: China portrays its\nmid-century self as a global leader in every\narea of human consequence: economics and\ntrade, science and technology, military and\ndefense, culture and governance.\n\nBut Chinese leaders, and officials in gener-\nal, seem to have a different highlight. While\nthe “Two Centenary Goals” are certainly vital,\nespecially with new stages and specificity, they\nfocus on the amendment to the Party Consti-\ntution: “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with\nChinese Characteristics for a New Era”.\n\n“The (Xi’s) thought is the biggest high-\nlight of the 19th National Congress of the\nCPC and a historic contribution to the Par-\nty’s development,” said Zhang Dejiang, the\nthird-ranking member of the Standing\nCommittee of the Political Bureau of the\n18th CPC Central Committee. Liu Yunshan,\nthe fifth-ranking member, said the elevation\nof Xi’s thought to the Party’s guiding princi-\nple is of great political, theoretical and prac-\ntical significance.\n\nI take a closer look at Xi’s thought: first by\nexamining each of its elements, then by con-\nsidering its unified significance.\n\n“Xi Jinping” is the “core” of the CPC Cen-\ntral Committee and of the whole Party, and\nhe thereby at the top level provides the “cen-\ntralism” of the Party’s cardinal principle of\ndemocratic centralism.\n\nThe “Thought” is the totality of Xi’s fun-\ndamental principles. I see four broad cate-\ngories: people orientation, national\nrejuvenation, comprehensive development,\nand Party leadership.\n\nIn his report, Xi listed 14 categories: Party\nleadership over all aspects of society; peo-\nple-centered policies; deepening reform\ncomprehensively; new concept of develop-\nment (innovation, coordination, green,\nopen, and sharing); people as masters of the\ncountry; adherence to rule of law, compre-\nhensively governing the country by law;\nsocialist value system and cultural confi-\n\ndence; protecting and improving people's\nlivelihoods; harmonious coexistence of man.\nand nature (ecological civilization); national\nsecurity; the Party’s absolute leadership\nover the military; “one country, two sys-\ntems” and promoting reunification with Tai-\nwan; international community of a shared.\nfuture for all humanity; and comprehensive\nand strict Party governance.\n\nThe term “thought” in Chinese has special\nmeaning because before this it had been\nassociated only with Mao Zedong — “Mao\nZedong Thought”.\n\n“Socialism” is a set of political ideas with a\ncomplex history, unified by public or com-\nmon ownership of the means of production\nand concern for the masses.\n\n“Chinese characteristics” is the phrase,\noriginating with Deng Xiaoping, that adapts\nMarxism to China’s special conditions — the\nSinicization of Marxism in modern China —\nwhich includes the market playing a decisive\nrole in the allocation of resources and the\nencouragement of non-public, for-profit busi-\nnesses, while at the same time State-owned\nenterprises still playing a dominant role.\n\n“New Era” is a new idea in the constitu-\ntional amendment, and it is designed to\nprofoundly transform the essence of social-\nism with Chinese characteristics into the\nvision, concepts and strategies that com-\npose Xi’s way of thinking.\n\nThe more I reflect, the more I see “New\nEra” as a conceptual lens with which to view\nthe 19th Party Congress. Semi-official Party\nanalysts say the new era answers five ques-\ntions.\n\nhensiveness of the cate-\ngories were clear,\namplified by the commit-\nment to deepen reform.\nHere, by category, are\nwhat stood out.\n\nThe Party and the\nfight against corrup-\ntion. Confidence in\nsocialism and the\nincreasing role of the\nParty in managing all\naspects of the country is unequivocal, and.\nthe increasingly strict governance of the\nParty, by reforming and purifying itself, is\nunambiguous. Moreover, the anti-corrup-\ntion campaign not only continues but also\nwill be enhanced.\n\nEconomy. After more than three decades\nof rapid growth, China’s economy has been\ntransitioning to slower but higher-quality\ngrowth. Supply-side structural reform has\nbeen written into the Constitution. No GDP\ngrowth targets are set. The country focuses\non the real economy (as opposed to specula-\ntion, such as in the real estate sector). China\nis not backing away from State-owned\nenterprises, rather it will support State capi-\ntal in “becoming stronger, doing better, and\ngrowing bigger, thereby turning Chinese\nenterprises into world-class, globally com-\npetitive firms”\n\nConsumption is fundamental in driving\neconomic growth. The framework of regula-\ntions must be improved, prudent macroeco-\nnomic and monetary policy maintained,\nand interest and exchange rates made more\n\nRobert\nLawrence Kuhn\n\n‘Xi said, an example of his plainspoken can-\ndor. “It will take more than drum-beating\nand gong-clanging to get there.”\n\nThe speculations of China watchers, and\nthe focus of the international media, have\nbeen on the new Standing Committee of the\nPolitical Bureau of the CPC Central Commit-\ntee. Because everything in China reports to\nastanding committee member, composition.\nand balance determine the vision, strategies\nand policies that will shape China.\n\nThis remains true today, but less true\ntoday. It is hard to overstate the signifi-\ncance of Xi Jinping’s name written into the\nParty Constitution. Xi is now, officially, the\noriginating designator and overarching\narbiter of “Thought” as it relates to “Social-\nism with Chinese Characteristics for a New\nEra’, which is the guiding political theory of\nChina and encompasses, essentially, every-\nthing in China. For Xi to be named in the\nCPC Constitution is the ultimate in authori-\nty, surpassing even “core” (which already\nhad superseded all other leaders), thus set-\nting into perpetuity Xi’s predominant sta-\ntus and assuring his preeminence in the\ncountry’s political life.\n\nThat said, to know China is to know the\nmembers of the Standing Committee. They\nare a highly competent, highly experienced\ngroup: six of the seven have run provinces\nor province-level municipalities, many of\nwhich, in terms of population and GDP, are\nthe equivalent of major nations.\n\nTraditional norms of balance and age are\nrespected. It’s a diverse group — by geogra-\nphy, education and political career. They\n\nWhat “road” to take? Socialism with Chi-\nnese characteristics under new historical\nconditions.\n\n‘What kind of country to build? First, a\nmoderately prosperous society and then a\nmodernized socialist country.\n\n‘What development to realize? Better life\nand common prosperity for all.\n\n‘What goal to achieve? The great rejuvena-\ntion of the Chinese nation.\n\nWhat contribution to make? Facilitate\nworld peace and prosperity (exemplified by\nthe Belt and Road Initiative of building\ninfrastructure in developing countries).\n\nThus, Xi Jinping joins only Mao Zedong\nand Deng Xiaoping in having his name\naffixed to a political philosophy in the Party\nConstitution, a blazing sign lost on no one.\nIt then would follow that the “New Era” into\nwhich China is now entering is the third era\nof the CPC and by extension of the People’s\nRepublic of China.\n\nAseemingly subtle but significant\nchange is the Party's judgment of what con-\nstitutes the fundamental “contradiction” in\nChinese society. (“Contradiction” is a Marx-\nist term expressing a particular way of\npolitical thinking — dialectical materialism.\n— which identifies “dynamic opposing for-\n\nes” in society and seeks to resolve the\nresulting tensions).\n\nThe principal contradiction has evolved\nfrom one between the ever-growing materi-\nal and cultural needs of the people and\nbackward social production to that between\n“anbalanced and inadequate development\nand the people's ever-growing needs for a\nbetter life,” Xi said. The needs for the people\nto live a better life are increasingly broad\nand have to be met. Not only have their\nmaterial and cultural needs grown; their\ndemands for democracy, rule of law, fairness\nand justice, security, and a better environ-\nment are increasing.\n\nThis “New-Era” contradiction, replacing\nquantitative GDP growth with qualitative\nimprovement of life, is what will drive Chi-\nna’s policy.\n\nThe mission of a CPC congress is to review\nand assess achievements of the previous five\nyears, and to forecast challenges and set tar-\ngets for the subsequent five years (and\nbeyond). Overall, for the 19th Party Congress,\nthe ambition of the goals and the compre-\n\nmarket-based. For economic development,\ninnovation leads, especially in science and\ntechnology.\n\nPoverty alleviation. Xi has made the\nelimination of extreme poverty in China by\n2020 a cornerstone of his domestic policy.\nAfter all, how could China claim to have\nachieved a moderately prosperous society\nby 2020 if millions of its citizens would be\nstill living in extreme poverty?\n\nOpening-up. China reasserts its com-\nmitment to become more open, including\neasing market access and protecting the\nrights and interests of foreign investors.\nChina’s economists see foreign competition\nas upgrading the quality and cost efficiency\nof Chinese companies, thus better serving\nChinese consumers.\n\nRule of Law. Strengthening and institu-\ntionalizing the rule of law, and weakening\narbitrary rule of officials, is a priority.\nReflecting Xi’s commitment, the Party is set-\nting up a central leading group for advanc-\ning law-based governance in all areas,\ncoordinating the activities of judicial\norgans. The goal is to complete the transfor-\nmation of China’s legal system by 2035 with\ntheoretical foundations and practical\nenforcement.\n\nEcology. Beautiful China is one of the\ncountry’s main descriptions for its second\ncentenary goal by the middle of the century.\nThis modernization is characterized by har-\nmonious coexistence between humanity\nand nature (such as nature parks) and it\nrequires substantial bolstering of regulatory\nagencies and their enforcement powers.\n\nArmed forces. China's goal is to trans-\nform the People’s Liberation Army into a\nworld-class military by mid-century, basical-\nly completing military reform and moderni-\nzation by 2035, with information\ntechnology/cyber applications and strategic\ncapabilities prioritized.\n\nEspecially significant for Xi’s mission are\nthe two “anti’s” — anti-corruption and anti-\npoverty — the former to support the Party’s\ncontinuing leadership, the latter as a prime\nexample of what the Party has delivered.\n\nXi does not downplay a realistic appraisal\nof problems, including social imbalances,\nindustrial overcapacities, financial system\nrisks, endemic pollution. “Achieving nation-\nal rejuvenation will be no walk in the park,”\n\nZHAI HAIJUN / FOR CHINA DAILY\n\nhave worked together, in various combina-\ntions, for years. With much now being writ-\nten about each member, I’ll just offer some\npersonal reflections.\n\nFirst, of course, is Xi Jinping, general sec-\nretary of the CPC Central Committee, whose\nprior experience included governor of Fuji-\nan province and Party secretary of Zhejiang\nprovince and Shanghai.\n\nIn 2005, I was advised to study the “Zheji-\nang model” which promotes entrepreneur-\nship to generate economic development. I\nmet Xi, who was then Zhejiang provincial\nParty secretary, and he recommended that I\nstudy China both “horizontally” across\ndiverse regions and “vertically” through the\nhistory of its development.\n\n“To understand our dedication to revitalize\n‘the country, one has to appreciate the pride\nthat Chinese people take in our glorious\nancient civilization,’ Xi said. “This is the histor-\nical driving force inspiring people today to\nbuild the nation. The Chinese people made\ngreat contributions to world civilization and\nenjoyed long-term prosperity,’ he said. “Then\nwe suffered over a century of national weak-\nness, oppression and humiliation. So, we\nhave a deep self-motivation to build our\ncountry. Our commitment and determina-\ntion is rooted in our patriotism and pride.”\n\nBut he cautioned that pride in China’s\nrecent achievements should not engender\ncomplacency.\n\nSecond, premier of the State Council, is\nLi Keqiang, who was Party secretary of Hen-\nan and Liaoning provinces. When I visited\nLiin Liaoning, he explained the complex\nchallenges of revitalizing State-owned\nenterprises while creating a fertile environ-\nment for private businesses. Li shared the\nsame experience of Xi as educated youths in\nthe countryside in the 1970s. The experience\ngave them the chance to know better rural\nChina and the lives of rural people and thus\nfostered their people-orientation.\n\nThe following members are new:\n\nLi Zhanshu, who was governor of Hei-\nlongjiang province and Party secretary of\nGuizhou province, has been director of the\ngeneral office of the CPC Central Committee\nsince 2012.\n\n‘Wang Yang, vice-premier, is former Party\nsecretary of Chongqing municipality and\nGuangdong province. At the height of the\n\nglobal financial crisis in early 2009, he\nargued it was imperative to restructure\nGuangdong’s economy, so that it can move\nup the ladder of industrialization and pro-\nmote more knowledge-based, high-tech, low-\npolluting businesses.\n\n‘Wang Huning, secretariat, is director of\nthe Policy Research Office of the CPC Central\nCommittee. Wang is well known for provid-\ning intellectual vision and sophistication in\nsupport of practical strategies and policies,\nranging from political philosophy to interna-\ntional relations.\n\nZhao Leji, new chairman of the Central\nCommission for Discipline Inspection, has\nserved as head of the CPC Organization\nDepartment, and before that, as Party secre-\ntary of Qinghai and Shaanxi provinces. In\naddition to his responsibilities for Party and\ngovernment officials, Zhao provided strong\nsupport for the poverty-alleviation mission.\n\nHan Zheng is Party secretary of Shanghai.\nUnder his leadership, Shanghai has become\narecognized leader in trade, logistics and\nfinance.\n\nWhat is the impact of all this on China’s\ninternational relations?\n\nThere is no need to speculate. Xi himself,\nin his report, openly and boldly tells all who\nwill listen. China, he says, “has become a\ngreat power in the world” China's global\nengagement is proactive, confident and\ngrowing. Economics and trade drive China’s\npower, exemplified by the much-needed Belt\nand Road Initiative, but diplomacy, the soft\npower of culture and media, and the hard\npower of a blue-water navy projecting power,\nare developing rapidly.\n\nAs Xi said, the new era sees “China moving\ncloser to center stage and making greater\ncontributions to mankind” The country is\nnow offering “Chinese wisdom” and “Chinese\nsolutions” to the international community —\nthe experiences and lessons of China’s\nremarkable development, especially to devel-\noping countries.\n\nRegarding Taiwan, which exemplifies Chi-\nnese sovereignty, Xi painted a bright red line.\n“We will resolutely uphold national sover-\neignty and territorial integrity and will never\ntolerate a repeat of the historical tragedy of a\ndivided country;’ Xi emphasized. “We have\nfirm will, full confidence, and sufficient capa-\nbility to defeat any form of Taiwan independ-\nence secession plot.”\n\nChina has asserted again that it is no\nthreat to any country. No matter how power-\nful China becomes, China’s leaders say it will\nnever seek hegemony or pursue expansion-\nism. Nonetheless, some foreigners remain.\nsuspicious, wary of China’s long-term ambi-\ntions. Who knows future circumstances, they\nworry? Who knows how China may change?\nAlthough I fear self-fulfilling prophecy, I am\nencouraged that China appreciates such sen-\nsitivities and works to build confidence.\n\nThe 19th Party Congress, especially Xi’s\nreport, is an epic narrative of what China has\naccomplished, what China has yet to achieve,\nand what China envisages as necessary to be\na great nation. Xi, now, carries the authority;\nhe also bears the burden.\n\nSetting that new target date of 2035 for\nChina to achieve basic modernization, Xi\nsees China as standing at a new historic\nstarting point and socialism with Chinese\ncharacteristics as exploring new horizons.\nChina has entered a new era and the road\nahead leads, apparently, to great nation sta-\ntus by 2050.\n\nThe author is a public intellectual, interna-\ntional corporate strategist, and China expert/\ncommentator.

I thought I might send \nmy questions to you tonight, so you'd have them first thing tomorrow. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031099 \nWould you like to comment on the following: \n1. You've said that the women pressing suits against Mr. Epstein \"have lied repeatedly, and in \nno way shape or form were they victims. They were at his place freely and voluntarily. And one \nof them showed Epstein a fake ID.\" What do you have to say now that Mr. Epstein has \nadmitted in his federal plea bargain that he did conspire to entice minors to engage in \nprostitution? Accepting that these women came voluntarily, isn't Mr Epstein still guilty of \nstatutory rape? \n2. Brad Edwards, an attorney who represents three of the women, recently served a \nSubpoena to Testify at a Deposition on Epstein's former girlfriend, Ghislaine \nMaxwell. The Subpoena asks that Maxwell produce \"a list of all girls\" that visited \nJeffrey Epstein's homes in Palm Beach and Manhattan, or flew on his \nplanes. Edwards said in an interview that Maxwell was \"second-in-command of \nEpstein's criminal enterprise.\" He added, \"She was on Epstein's plane, transporting girls \nfor the purpose of having sex with other people. She kept a computer database of hundreds of \ngirls and oversaw the schedule of girls who came to Epstein's homes.\" \n3. A suit filed last May by \"Jane Doe 102\" against Epstein alleges that, after recruiting her as a 15-\nyear-old girl to give Epstein massages, Maxwell and Epstein took part in \"sexually assaulting, \nbattering, exploiting, and abusing Plaintiff.\" \n4. The same suit alleges that Epstein \"lured\" the girl \"every day for next two weeks\" to his \nhouse. The suit claims that she eventually became a \"sex slave\" to Epstein, traveling with him \naround the world. \"In all of these locations, she was required to engage in sex acts with him and \nother women - including other minors.\" \n5. Did Jane Doe 102 — who now lives in Australia — go on the 2002 trip where \nPresident Clinton flew on Mr. Epstein's Boeing 727? \n6. \"Most of these acts of abuse occurred during a time when defendant [Jane Doe 102] knew \nthat the plaintiff was approximately 15, 16 and 17 years old and, after years of daily sexual \nexploitation continued into her adulthood ... until she fled at age 19,\" \n7. When Maxwell and Epstein celebrated Jane Doe 102's 16th birthday with her, Epstein joked that \nhe would have to \"trade her in\" because she was getting too old for him. \n8. Not only was Jane Doe 102 required to satisfy Epstein's \"every sexual whim,\" but she also was \nexploited by Epstein's adult male peers. They included \"royalty, politicians, academicians, \nbusinessmen and others in various locations around the world.\" \n9. The Palm Beach Post and lawyers representing Epstein's alleged victims have called his federal \nnon-prosecution agreement a \"secret,\" \"backroom,\" \"sweetheart\" deal, noting that none of his \nalleged victims was consulted. Several critics have claimed Epstein \"bought\" the agreement, using \npolitically-connected lawyers. Would he like to comment? \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031100 \n10. Is Epstein cooperating with federal suit against Bear Steams hedge fund managers Ralph Cioffi \nand Matthew Tannin? Will he testify in their cases? \n11. Mr Epstein was deposed on this week, on Thursday. Is it true that he answered almost every \nquestion by invoking his Fifth Amendment rights? \n12. Defense attorney Brad Evans has filed a motion to freeze Mr Epstein's assets. Has Mr. \nEpstein moved his money from the US offshore or abroad, or does he intend to, in order to \nprotect his assets from possible damage claims? \n13. What did Mr. Epstein do during his work release program while serving time. Reports have \nsaid he engaged in \"scientific research.\" If so, what was he researching? \n14. Has Mr. Epstein returned to pursuing his investment business? Is Mr Epstein still on \nprobation? \n15. Is Mr. Epstein permitted to leave Florida or the United States? Do authorities hold his \npassport? \nYou can reach me via e-mail or at 212-210-1536 or 917-952-4052. We close our column at 3 \npm on Friday but can add comments as late as 3 pm on Saturday.

Reiter won't\ndiscuss the case or the broadsides aimed at him. But others almost uniformly use one\nword to describe the chief: professional.\n\n\"I have always been impressed by Mike's professionalism and his leadership,\" said Rick\nLincoln, chief of the Lantana Police Department and a Palm Beach County cop for 32\nyears. \"The town of Palm Beach has a very professional police department. We all\nconsider Mike to be our peer and a man of integrity.\" Juno Beach Police Chief H.C.\nClark II agreed. Although he doesn't know Reiter well, he has met with him on\ncountywide law enforcement issues. \"I've never seen him lose his cool. I've never seen\nanything but a professional demeanor from him.\"\n\nReiter joined the Palm Beach Police Department in 1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year patrol\njob at the University of Pittsburgh. His personnel jacket shows consistently excellent job\nevaluations. Posh Palm Beach is no hotbed of crime, and in his first year on the job, a\nresident confined to his home with a sick child thanked Reiter for delivering a few Cokes\nto the house. Reiter refused payment for the beverages. Another resident thanked Reiter\nfor shutting off his car's headlights in his driveway, saying a valet must have been at\nfault. Reiter worked everything from road patrol to organized crime, vice and narcotics.\nAnd he's no novice at investigations involving the island's rich and famous. He was the\nlead detective probing the drug overdose death of David Kennedy in 1984. He also was\none of the officers who worked the investigation of William Kennedy Smith, who was\ncharged in 1991 — and later acquitted — with raping a woman at the Kennedy family\ncompound in Palm Beach.\n\nReiter, who has a master's degree in human resource development from Palm Beach\nAtlantic University, also has attended the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Va., and\nmanagement courses at Harvard. He's been active in countywide interagency law\nenforcement organizations and has a \"top secret\" national security clearance.\n\n\"He has a perspective that's broader than just addressing the needs of the town,\" said\nTown Manager Peter\n\nElwell, who promoted Reiter from assistant chief to chief in March 2001.

We think petitioners have the better reading of the\nstatute.\n\nA\n\nThe language of the IOIA more naturally lends itself to\npetitioners’ reading. In granting international organiza-\ntions the “same immunity” from suit “as is enjoyed by\nforeign governments,” the Act seems to continuously link\nthe immunity of international organizations to that of\nforeign governments, so as to ensure ongoing parity be-\ntween the two. The statute could otherwise have simply\nstated that international organizations “shall enjoy abso-\nlute immunity from suit,” or specified some other fixed\nlevel of immunity. Other provisions of the IOTA, such as\nthe one making the property and assets of international\norganizations “immune from search,” use such noncom-\nparative language to define immunities in a static way. 22\nU.S. C. §288a(c). Or the statute could have specified that\nit was incorporating the law of foreign sovereign immunity\nas it existed on a particular date. See, e.g., Energy Policy\nAct of 1992, 80 U.S. C. §242(c)(1) (certain land patents\n“shall provide for surface use to the same extent as is\nprovided under applicable law prior to October 24, 1992”).\nBecause the IOIA does neither of those things, we think\nthe “same as” formulation is best understood to make\ninternational organization immunity and foreign sover-\neign immunity continuously equivalent.\n\nThat reading finds support in other statutes that use\nsimilar or identical language to place two groups on equal\nfooting. In the Civil Rights Act of 1866, for instance,\nCongress established a rule of equal treatment for newly\nfreed slaves by giving them the “same right” to make and\nenforce contracts and to buy and sell property “as is en-\njoyed by white citizens.” 42 U.S. C. §§1981(a), 1982. That\nprovision is of course understood to guarantee continuous\nequality between white and nonwhite citizens with respect\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028549\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. P’ve just been. You will never\nthink the same way about anything again.”\n\nSo spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up everywhere at the moment\nas the alleged “procurer” of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEpstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of another\ninvestigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with allegations that he molested\nthem when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British newspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein’s\nfriendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to publicly disassociate himself from his old pal.\n\nI wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called “The Talented Mr. Epstein.” It was largely a business piece that focused on his\nmysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les Wexner, the chairman of Limited\nBrands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail\nsentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of $450 million.\n\nThe piece alluded to Epstein’s great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women with whom he had\nsexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn’t really go there, focusing instead on the issue that remains a mystery—how\nJeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers.\n\nThis is not to say I didn’t hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on the intriguing\nfinancial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same ones, different ones. And their stories are bone-\nchilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one case, flown—to ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he?\nAnd the British, especially, want to know: Who is she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all,\nmy 2003 Vanity Fairstory that really brought him into the limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself.\n\nBizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept running into both of\nthem, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of young women with him who stand two feet\nbehind him, as if serving a monarch. “Do they speak?” I remember asking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He\nlaughed. “Not like vou, Vicky,” was his riposte.\n\nIremembered that when we’d once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn’t studied math\nsince I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at home via messenger. It was a\nbook: “Math for idiots.”\n\nSo he is not without humor, even though he doesn’t drink or smoke, and hates restaurants.\n\n“Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects,” newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He was certainly\npreaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few moments in his company and\nyou know this to be true.\n\nWhen I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that “Andy’—as Jeffrey\ncalls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange title is. Because if one thing’s\nfor sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he’s talking about far more than “Andy” does. Which is\nwhy Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other financiers hang out with him.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030460\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

However, the NFL season is\nover, the election surprise is slowing fading, competitive pressure is rising (particularly\nInstagram), and new monetization initiatives will take time, so we are more cautious on\n2Q. The high level of executive churn also raises an element of strategic uncertainty\nthat could continue to weigh on sentiment. While it’s possible Twitter could see\nmoderate residual benefit from recent YouTube/Google Display Network boycotts, we\ncontinue to believe MAU growth acceleration is key to improving sentiment, and we\ncontinue to expect other platforms to grow much faster. The biggest upside driver for\n1Q could be conservative guidance, which implied revenues would be down 17% y/y at\nthe midpoint in 1Q.\n\nLonger-term, our primary concerns are user growth, rising competition in video, and lack\nof positive advertiser feedback. Despite execution on the live streaming initiative in\n2016, MAU impact was underwhelming and we see risk of rising costs and/or content\nloss in 2017. At this point, it’s unclear how aggressively management will push live\nstreaming in 2017, and early exploration of potential subscription revenue streams\n(enhanced Tweetdeck offering beta) could suggest potential strategic shifts. On the\nadvertiser side, we are still hearing limited traction with Twitter’s ad platform changes\nand ROI measurement, and it seems experimental dollars are being moved to Snap.\n\nThe biggest risk to our Underperform rating, in our view, is the underlying value of the\nTwitter platform for users and potential Artificial Intelligence (Al} signals. We remain on\nthe sideline for now, with ever-present M&A potential providing some element of a floor\nto the stock. We think 3x 2017 revenues plus cash ($12/share in total) is a valuation an\nacquirer could see as very reasonable given stabilizing DAU trends and value of Twitter\ndata.\n\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Mgmt focus on engagement, investors on users\n\nMAU growth likely remains the primary focus in terms of metrics investors consider.\nWhile DAU growth could continue to growth at high single digits, we do not see much\nupside potential to low single digit MAU growth (we model 322mn, 4% y/y), which lags\nin comparison to Facebook’s recent17% y/y growth. We expect engagement metrics in\ngeneral (tweet impressions, DAU growth, time spent) to be solid, though it’s possible\nlack of NFL and fading US election catalysts could have some negative effect. In terms\nof monetization, our ARPU estimate for $1.67 implies a 14% y/y decline, which reflects\nboth weaker Twitter pricing trends and potential competitive pricing pressures.\n\nBiggest 1Q issues/risks:\n¢ MAU growth could slip: We model 4% y/y MAU growth to 322mn, but fading NFL\nand election tailwinds could lead to weaker user growth trends in 2Q.\n\n¢ Competition could impact pricing: Management noted elevated competition in\nmid-January (shortly after Snap’s ad API update}, which may have continued\nthroughout the quarter and impacted pricing more than anticipated.\n\n- Live streaming pipeline in question: Amazon recently announced a deal with the\nNFL to steam game content, replacing Twitter.\n\n¢ Ad product wind-down could impact revenue: Management indicated that it is\nreevaluating lower return ad formats, and a decision to wind down certain formats\n(like direct response, promoted tweets) could further impact 2Q guidance.\n\nBankof America\n\nMerrill Lynch Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April2017 43\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014929\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Ben will thus begin by expressing his thanks to his primary\nco-authors, Cassio Pennachin (collaborator since 1998) and Nil Geisweiller (collaborator since\n2005). Without outstandingly insightful, deep-thinking colleagues like you, the ideas presented\nhere — let alone the book itself— would not have developed nearly as effectively as what has\nhappened. Similar thanks also go to the other OpenCog collaborators who have co-authored\nvarious chapters of the book.\n\nBeyond the co-authors, huge gratitude must also be extended to everyone who has been\ninvolved with the OpenCog project, and/or was involved in Novamente LLC and Webmind Inc.\nbefore that. We are grateful to all of you for your collaboration and intellectual companionship!\n\nBuilding a thinking machine is a huge project, too big for any one human; it will take a team\nand I’m happy to be part of a great one. It is through the genius of human collectives, going\nbeyond any individual human mind, that genius machines are going to be created.\n\nA tiny, incomplete sample from the long list of those others deserving thanks is:\n\ne Ken Silverman and Gwendalin Qi Aranya (formerly Gwen Goertzel), both of whom listened\n\nto me talk at inordinate length about many of the ideas presented here a long, long time\n\nbefore anyone else was interested in listening. Ken and I schemed some AGI designs at\n\nSimon’s Rock College in 1983, years before we worked together on the Webmind AI Engine.\n\nAllan Combs, who got me thinking about consciousness in various different ways, at a very\n\nearly point in my career. I’m very pleased to still count Allan as a friend and sometime\n\ncollaborator! Fred Abraham as well, for introducing me to the intersection of chaos theory\nand cognition, with a wonderful flair. George Christos, a deep AI/math/physics thinker from\n\nPerth, for re-awakening my interest in attractor neural nets and their cognitive implications,\n\nin the mid-1990s.\n\ne All of the 130 staff of Webmind Inc. during 1998-2001 while that remarkable, ambitious,\npeculiar AGI-oriented firm existed. Special shout-outs to the \"Voice of Reason\" Pei Wang\nand the \"Siberian Madmind\" Anton Kolonin, Mike Ross, Cate Hartley, Karin Verspoor and\nthe tragically prematurely deceased Jeff Pressing (compared to whom we are all mental\nmidgets), who all made serious conceptual contributions to my thinking about AGI. Lisa\nPazer and Andy Siciliano who made Webmind happen on the business side.

Epstein's legal team included West Palm Beach defense\nattorney Jack Goldberger, Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz, who defended O.J. Simpson\nagainst murder charges, and Kenneth Starr, the prosecutor who pursued then-President Bill Clinton for lying\nabout sex with young women.\n\nPalm Beach police spent 11 months investigating Epstein before State Attorney Barry Krischer sent the case to\na grand jury, instead of charging Epstein so the man who once boasted of accepting only billionaire clients\ncould face a trial. The police had taken a high school transcript, class schedules and phone messages from\nEpstein's home that showed he knew the girls were underage. Yet Mr. Krischer was more swayed by Epstein's\nlawyers, who attempted to impugn the girls' character by showing they had chatted on myspace.com about\nsmoking marijuana and drinking. He should have let a jury decide whether the victims - and Epstein - were\ncredible.\n\nUltimately, one charge against Epstein finally reflected the age of one victim, and the plea agreement left\nEpstein labeled a sex offender. With that additional charge, if Epstein had been convicted at a trial, he could\nhave been sentenced to anything from probation to 15 years in prison, Assistant State Attorney Lanna\nBelohlavek said, adding that the recommended guideline sentence was 21 months.\n\nEpstein also won't have to certify to the court that he is receiving counseling, typically required of sex\noffenders, because he has a private psychiatrist. But without court supervision, who will ensure Epstein is in\nfact being treated?\n\nThe plea deal also drops a federal investigation of Epstein. If a federal investigation was warranted, how does\ndropping it before completion benefit the public?\n\nEpstein preyed on girls and denied it. For three years, his wealth and the influence of his lawyers bought him\nthe protection the state attorney owed to the victims.\n\nPolice chief's reputation helps discredit attacks\n\nBy Larry Keller\nPalm Beach Post Staff Writer\n\nMonday, August 14, 2006\n\nIn the case of Palm Beach financier Jeffrey Epstein, it seems, at times, as if two men are accused of\nwrongdoing: Epstein and Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter.\n\nEpstein, 53, was indicted last month on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution solely because of Reiter's\n\"craziness,\" one of Epstein's lawyers said. His department disseminated \"a distorted view of the case\" and\nbehaved in a \"childish\" manner when the grand jury didn't indict Epstein on the charges it sought, another\nEpstein lawyer complained. To hear the Epstein camp tell it, Reiter, 48, is a loose cannon better suited to be the\nsheriff of Mayberry. They whisper that he's embroiled in a messy divorce.\n\nReiter did in fact file for divorce from his wife, Jill, last year, after 24 years of marriage. They have a son, 18,\nand a daughter, 14. The couple is scheduled to go to mediation next week, Aug. 16. Nothing in the court file\nsuggests their split is particularly ugly.\n\nReiter incurred the wrath of the Epstein camp as well as the state attorney's office for two reasons. First, he\npressed for Epstein to be charged with the more serious crimes of sexual activity with minors. Second, he\nslammed State Attorney Barry Krischer in blunt language seldom used by one law-enforcement official\nconcerning another because of what he perceived as that office's mishandling of the case.\n\nIn a letter to Krischer written May 1, Reiter called his actions in the Epstein case \"highly unusual.\" He added,\n\"I must urge you to... consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your disqualification from the\nprosecution of these cases.\"\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030312\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Victims never got that opportunity when Epstein faced criminal charges, because\nAlex Acosta — then the lead prosecutor, now the Secretary of Labor — let Epstein off with\na ridiculously lenient sentence. Despite having committed hideous sex offenses with dozens\nof minors, Epstein received a sentence of 13 months in jail, during which he was often free\nduring the day.\n\nEpstein’s decision to buy his out of the civil lawsuit, one that he had the nerve to initiate,\nbenefits Acosta. The trial would have provided non-stop headlines, coupled with frequent\nreferences to the sweetheart deal Acosta gave him. As Randy Schultz puts it, the trial would\nhave been the occasion for a long overdue public shaming of Acosta. Now, he avoids this\nconsequence.\n\nBut this doesn’t mean Acosta is out of the woods. He faces calls for his ouster from the\nTrump cabinet.\n\nSome calls are from the usual suspects. Michelle Goldberg of the New York Times has\nwritten a piece so obnoxious that it almost makes me want to see Acosta ride out the storm.\n\nBut some conservatives are also advocating Acosta’s departure. Concerned Women for\nAmerica 1s a stalwart conservative organization. It describes itself, accurately, as “focus[ed]\non seven core issues: the family, the sanctity of human life, religious liberty, education,\nsexual exploitation, national sovereignty, and support for Israel.” (Emphasis added)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030983\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He called the attacks “an act of war’ and said we should “respond in\nkind.” We did move troops and tanks to the border. But my view, which Rabin\nshared, was that a major ground operation would risk miring ourselves more\ndeeply without fundamentally improving the situation. Hizbollah was the kind\nof nonconventional enemy | had in mind when Id taken stock of Israel’s\nchanging security imperatives on becoming chief of staff. It was a small force,\nentrenched and well armed, increasingly supported by Iran and Syria. Its tactics\nrested on quick-hit attacks on our soldiers in south Lebanon. Far from fearing\nmilitary retaliation, Hizbollah knew that short of a 1982-scale war — and maybe\neven then — it would survive. It also didn’t care whether Lebanese civilians died\nin the crossfire. In fact, like the PLO fighters who had controlled the area before\n1982, Hizbollah deliberately fired into Israel from civilian areas.\n\nNeither Rabin nor I had abandoned the idea of a large-scale military\noperation at some point, particularly if the cross-border rocket fire didn’t\nsubside, which for a while it did. But we were determined that, if and when we\ndid decide to strike, we would avoid anything on the scale of the 1982 war. It\nwould have to be with a clear, finite and achievable goal.\n\nThat point finally arrived in the summer of 1993. In addition to renewed\nKatyusha strikes, there was a series of deadly Hizbollah attacks in the first two\nweeks of July inside the security zone. Each used what was becoming the tactic\nof choice: a remotely detonated bomb by the side of the road on which our\nmilitary vehicles were travelling, followed by an ambush of soldiers who\nsurvived the blast. Six Israelis had been killed in all, making it the largest\nmonthly toll in three years. When I went to see Rabin with our plan for a\nmilitary response, I recognized the risks. It would be the largest military\noperation in Lebanon since the war. But I believed we could limit civilian\ncasualties, and that it was the only approach that might lead to a significant\nreduction in the missile attacks on northern Israel. I began with the assumption\nthat, left to its own devices, Hizbollah would have no incentive to stop firing.\nSince the two Arab governments with the potential to rein in the attacks —\nLebanon’s and above all Syria’s — were showing no interest in doing so, we had\nto find a way to hold them to account.\n\nThe operation I proposed was intended to send a message to Beirut and\nDamascus. It would not be a ground invasion as in 1982. Most of the attacks\nwould be from the air, in two stages. The first would target Hizbollah, both in\nsouthern Lebanon and in the Bekaa Valley further north, near the border with\n\n251\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011722\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Scripts are practiced. We can prepare for them if\nthat makes people happy. We can tell a child what will happen when\nhe rides in an airplane for the first time, but it isn’t so that he can do\nwhat he is supposed to do so much as to make him more comfortable\nand less surprised by noises or procedures that might be upsetting.\nThe only way to really learn a script is to do it again and again.\n\nSo what does this tell us about teaching scripts? What if we don’t\nhave the time to allow a student to practice? This is, of course, what\nhappens in job-training situations. We tell someone what to do and\nhope they very quickly will learn how to do it. We can’t afford weeks\nof practice. So how do we teach scripts in that case?\n\nThe answer to this depends on the number of mistakes that it\nis possible to make while executing a script. The real issue in script\nexecution is, after all, not knowing the next steps, but knowing what\nto do (or what not to do) when the script begins to falter in some\nway. This means that a teacher (or a course designer) must have one\nquestion in mind when thinking about teaching a script: What are\nthe most common (and most important) mistakes that are made by\nnovices when they execute this script?\n\nTo teach people to avoid mistakes in a script, or to teach them to\nget out of difficult situations properly, one must practice those situa-\ntions. This means that script teaching must focus around errors and\nthat it is the job of a teacher to systematically make sure that every-\nthing that could go wrong, does go wrong in any practice situation.\nTeaching scripts means helping the student form a case base of errors\nand a case base of how to handle them. Here again, this cannot be\ntaught consciously. Script failures must be taught through practice.\nThe students must build up their own case bases by experiencing the\nproblem and then either think their way out of it, or learn standard\nsolutions as a way out of it by practicing them. So, we can speed up\nthe script-learning process by creating a simulation that has every im-\nportant mistake built into it waiting for the student to trip up and\nmake that mistake.\n\nWhen a script isn’t known and predictions need to be made, the\nusual human procedure is to adapt on old script to serve as a tempo-\nrary new one.

Third, to the extent that\ndesperation for social connections leads\nchronically lonely individuals to\nmisguidedly vest their interest in those\nwho are unlikely to meet their\nrelationship needs, they may need to\nlearn how to be selective and choose\nfriends and groups with whom\nreciprocally rewarding relationships can\nbe expected. This decision is critical to\nsuccess. Research indicates that the\npeople with whom we are most likely to\nform positive, lasting relationships are\nthose who have similar attitudes, beliefs,\nvalues, interests, and activities to our\nown. Therefore, people should not seek\nfriendships based on physical\nappearance, status, popularity, or\nconvenience, but rather on attitudes,\nbeliefs, values, and behaviors. Finally,\nbecause chronically lonely people expect\nto be disappointed with themselves and\nothers in their relationships, they may\nbenefit from training and practice in\ntaking a more optimistic perspective, in\nexpecting the best from themselves and\nfrom others. We play a much more\nimportant role in shaping our social\nenvironment than we often realize.\n\nAlthough no intervention to date\nhas incorporated all of these elements, at\nleast one randomized trial has\ndemonstrated that an intervention based\nupon volunteerism (Experience Corps)\ncan increase social activity in older\nadults (19). In this trial, older adults are\npaired with grade-school children and\ndedicate at least fifteen hours per week\n\n135\n\nPage\n\nthroughout the school year to assist the\nteachers in supporting and encouraging\nchildren in reading, writing, and\nmathematics. This strategy engages at\nleast two of the principles that emerged\nout of Cacioppo and Patrick’s theoretical\nframework (5)—the provision of a\n“safe” venue for making social\nconnections (i.e., the classroom of non-\nthreatening children), and the shifting of\nolder adults’ attention away from their\nown concers and toward the needs of\nsomeone else. In addition, this strategy\ncapitalizes on Erikson’s notion of\ngenerativity (1.e., helping future\ngenerations) (20). Interventions of this\nform deserve further assessment (21).\n\nConclusion\n\nWe began this chapter by noting\nthat loneliness is not uncommon and,\nalthough unpleasant, may prompt\nindividuals to attend to and repair their\nsocial connections. Loneliness affects\ncognition as well as well-being,\nhowever, and when loneliness persists it\nis a risk factor for myriad health\nproblems. Previous reviewers have\nsuggested that loneliness can be reduced\nthrough interventions that emphasize\nsocial skills development and group-\nbased activities. By quantitatively\nanalyzing twenty-two well-designed\nstudies, we found no evidence that these\nstrategies were any more effective in\nreducing loneliness than increasing\nsocial opportunities or social support, or\nmodifying maladaptive social\ncognitions, whether in a group or\nindividual context. A larger number of\nintervention studies may be needed to\ndetermine the relative efficacy of these\nintervention strategies. In the interim, it\nis clear from this review that global\nimpressions and intuitions will not\nsuffice when trying to reduce loneliness.\nFuture interventions should\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021381\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

She proceed to the back of the store\nwhere there was a public space called the Box Jelly. It was used mainly for counterculture events.\nFolding chairs and work tables had already been set up, Snowden was there waiting for her with\nLindsay Mills, who he introduced to Sandvik as his girlfriend. He told her that she was there to\nfilm the event.\n\nMills did not mention this Crypto party in her blog. But that Snowden brought her and\nintroduced her to Sandvik suggests that he did not keep secret from her his activities to further\nTOR.\n\nThe event started at six PM sharp. By Sandvik’s count, about twenty people gradually filled the\nroom. Some of them were from the local “Hi-Cap” computer club and other attendees were from\nSnowden’s NSA base. Snowden began the presentation by giving reasons why Internet users\nneeded to defend their privacy by using both encryption and TOR software. According to one\nattendee who asked not to be identified by name, Snowden, while not revealing that he worked\nfor the NSA, spoke with such precise knowledge about government surveillance capabilities that\nhe suspected Snowden worked for the government. Snowden next introduced Sandvik, who\ntook the podium and discussed the work of the TOR project, stressing the importance of\nexpanding the TOR network. Following their presentations, Snowden and Sandvik took\nquestions from the audience.\n\nThe Oahu crypto party, according to Sandvik, ended about 10 PM. No one objected to Mills\nmaking a video of the meeting even though it was dedicated to the idea of protecting privacy.\nThe video was not posted on the Internet so presumably Snowden wanted it for his own\npurposes. Afterwards, Sandvik went to a local diner called Zippy’s for a late dinner. She left\nHawaii two days later.\n\nEven though a number of the prominent hacktavists he invited were unable to attend,\nSnowden declared the Crypto party a huge success in his after-hours report. One of the people\nSnowden invited under the alias Cincinnatus was Parker Higgins, who was a prime mover in the\npreviously-mentioned Electronic Freedom Foundation. He now lived in California where he had\nfounded the San Francisco Crypto Party. (Higgins would make headlines in 2013 by flying a\nchartered blimp over the NSA’s secret facility in Utah and photographing it from the air).\nDespite Snowden’s efforts, Higgins wrote him that he was unable to attend the December Crypto\nParty because of the high price of the airfare that month between San Francisco and Honolulu.\n(Higgins was hardly poor: his family home in Oahu had been rented to President Obama for two\nof his vacations in Hawaii.) As a consolation, Higgins told Snowden that he would try to attend\nSnowden’s next Crypto Party, which was scheduled for February 23, 2013.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020227\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He said that he had read Greenwald’s account in Sa/on that past April, a\nblog in which Greenwald detailed the 40 times in which Poitras was searched by US authorities.\nThe story also said that Poitras believed that she was on a special watch-list and under constant\nUS government surveillance. She had come under such scrutiny by US authorities, it turned out,\nbecause of her documentary about American military abuses of civilians in Iraq in 2005 entitled\n“The Oath”. While filming it she was at a place close to an insurgent ambush of US troops in\nIraq. Her presence at the ambush site led Army intelligence officers to suspect (without any\nevidence) that she might have been tipped off by the insurgents. She firmly denied the charge and\nthe government never substantiated it. Even so, because of this incident, she was kept on a list\nthat caused authorities to search her at airports. As a result, she took elaborate counter-measures\nto evade any possible surveillance of her communications.\n\nSnowden knew about this incident because Greenwald described them in a great detail in a blog\nthat Snowden read (as he later told Greenwald.) “Poitras is now forced to take extreme steps —\nones that hamper her ability to do her work, “Greenwald wrote: “She now avoids traveling with\nany electronic devices. She uses alternative methods to deliver the most sensitive parts of her\nwork — raw film and interview notes — to secure locations. She spends substantial time and\nresources protecting her computers with encryption and password defenses. Especially when she\nis in the U.S., she avoids talking on the phone about her work, particularly to sources. And she\nsimply will not edit her films at her home out of fear — obviously well-grounded — that\ngovernment agents will attempt to search and seize the raw footage.” She claimed, as she told\njournalists, she was the victim of “Kafkaesque government harassment.”\n\nSnowden was duly impressed with her concerns about government surveillance. She fully\nsubscribed to his view that that government surveillance was ubiquitous. Indeed, he later\ndescribed her as “more paranoid when it comes to electronic security than I can be.” He meant it\nasacompliment. Such functional paranoia or, “operational security,” as Greenwald would call\nthe precautions that she took, dove-tailed with Snowden’s growing conviction that universal\nencryption was necessary to defeat the surveillance state. It also made her the perfect channel for\nSnowden to safely pass some of the classified documents he stole to Greenwald and other\njournalists.\n\nIt was not difficult to get her to cooperate in his plot. He played on her well-known concern\nabout government surveillance. He wrote, for example, “The surveillance you’ve experienced\nmeans you have been ‘selected’—a term which will mean more to you as you learn how the\nmodern SIGINT system works.” Just as she had been “chosen” by her work to act as his conduit,\naccording to Snowden, she had been chosen by the NSA as a target because of her work.

Further, there is evidence that each module carries out temporal predictive\npattern recognition as well as static pattern recognition. Audition likely utilizes a similar\nhierarchy. Olfaction may use something more like a Hopfield attractor neural network, as\ndescribed in Chapter 13. The networks corresponding to different sense modalities have\nmultiple cross-linkages, more at the upper levels than the lower, and also link richly into\nthe parts of the mind dealing with other functions.\n\ne Motor Control: This appears to be handled by a spatiotemporal hierarchy as well, in which\neach level of the hierarchy corresponds to higher-level (in space and time) movements. The\nhierarchy is very tightly linked in with the perceptual hierarchies, allowing sensorimotor\nlearning and coordination.\n\ne Memory: There appear to be multiple distinct but tightly cross-linked memory systems,\ncorresponding to different sorts of knowledge such as declarative (facts and beliefs), proce-\ndural, episodic, sensorimotor, attentional and intentional (goals).\n\ne Knowledge Representation: There appear to be multiple base-level representational\nsystems; at least one corresponding to each memory system, but perhaps more than that.\nAdditionally there must be the capability to dynamically create new context-specific repre-\nsentational systems founded on the base representational system.\n\ne Language: While there is surely some innate biasing in the human mind toward learning\ncertain types of linguistic structure, it’s also notable that language shares a great deal of\nstructure with other aspects of intelligence like social roles [CB00] and the physical world\n[Cas07]. Language appears to be learned based on biases toward learning certain types of\nrelational role systems; and language processing seems a complex mix of generic reason-\ning and pattern recognition processes with specialized acoustic and syntactic processing\nroutines.\n\ne Consciousness is pragmatically well-understood using Baars’ “global workspace” theory,\nin which a small subset of the mind’s content is summoned at each time into a “working\nmemory” aka “workspace” aka “attentional focus” where it is heavily processed and used to\nguide action selection.\n\ne Thinking is a diverse combination of processes encompassing things like categorization,\n(crisp and uncertain) reasoning, concept creation, pattern recognition, and others; these\nprocesses must work well with all the different types of memory and must effectively inte-\ngrate knowledge in the global workspace with knowledge in long-term memory.\n\ne Social Intelligence seems closely tied with language and also with self-modeling; we model\nourselves in large part using the same specialized biases we use to help us model others.\n\na Oe\n\nNone of the points in the above bullet list is particularly controversial, but neither are any\nof them universally agreed-upon by experts. However, in order to make any progress on AGI\ndesign one must make some commitments to particular cognition-theoretic understandings, at\nthis level and ultimately at more precise levels as well. Further, general philosophical analyses\nlike the patternist philosophy to be reviewed in the following chapter only provide limited\nguidance here. Patternism provides a filter for theories about specific cognitive functions — it\nrules out assemblages of cognitive-function-specific theories that don’t fit together to yield a\nmind that could act effectively as a pattern-recognizing, goalachieving system with the right\ninternal emergent structures. But it’s not a precise enough filter to serve as a sole guide for\ncognitive theory even at the high level.\n\nThe above list of points leads naturally into the integrative architecture diagram presented\nin Chapter 5. But that generic architecture diagram is fairly involved, and before presenting\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012939\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We have used the\nphrase “invisible forces” to describe the\nmechanisms that account for these\neffects that we essentially take for\ngranted, and to suggest by analogy that\nthey can be investigated rigorously just\nas other phenomena, such as gravity or\nautonomic regulation, that also are not\nimmediately present to our visual or\nother senses can be studied.\n\nHuman minds are unparalleled at\ndiscerning patterns in what they see\nagainst a background of noise and\nvariation, and they are equally adept at\nattributing meaning to them. As the\nessays in this volume demonstrate\nrepeatedly, we readily ascribe patterns\nwe encounter (or seek to encounter) to\ninvisible forces of nature, of God, of\nkinship, of genes, of culture, of love, of\nsocial connection. A common premise\nunderlying the work of the network is\nthat what we know (or what we think we\nknow), and how we come to know it, are\nsocial endeavors embedded in a shared\nview of both the world and how one\ntalks meaningfully about the world.

These forces operate at\nseveral different levels, from the\nmolecular, to individual bodily\nfunctions, to social groups, to societies,\nto species. They include such disparate\nideas as evolutionary selective pressure\nfavoring social connectedness,\nanthropomorphism, loneliness, social\nconnection, emergent phenomena,\nconnection to a higher being,\ntranscendence, empathy, language as\ncarrier for meaning, belief, collective\nwill, group synchrony, autonomic\nregulation, and neural resonance. These\nforces interact with one another, too:\nloneliness, for instance, acting as an\ninternal signal of the inadequacy of\none’s bonds of social connection, with\nconsequent effects on health, mediated\nthrough autonomic regulation, or the role\nof belief in mediating scientific\nobjectivity and empathy.\n\nIt is tempting to view individuals,\nboth souls and bodies, as arising from\nlower-level forces within, such as the\noperation of specialized neurons and\nregulatory biological processes.

The solvent\ndelivery unit pumps the solvent through the LC system while the sample injector\nintroduces the sample into the solvent flow (known as the mobile phase). The\nchromatography column then separates the sample into its components for analysis by\nthe detector, which measures the presence and amount of constituents. The data\nacquisition unit then records and stores the information from the detector. The\nunderlying principles of GC are similar to those of LC, with the key difference being that\nthe mobile phase is a gas instead of a liquid.\n\nLC Is Often Combined With Mass Spec\n\nTo obtain the mass spectrum of a single compound in a mixture, the individual\ncomponents must be separated prior to MS analysis. Separation is necessary for\nunambiguous identification because multiple compounds present simultaneously create\nan overlapping or mixed spectrum. The most common separation techniques used in\ncombination with MS are gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC). LC\nand MS from different vendors can be combined. LC is more commonly used as high\ntemperatures required for GC make it incompatible with the compounds under analysis -\nthis is a key reason why some cannabis testing labs prefer testing THC using liquid\nchromatography (to be clear, analysis using gas chromatography requires heating THC\nwhich changes its properties).\n\nChromatography Market Estimates\n\nFigure 14 Overall Chromatography Market (SMM) Figure 15 Chromatography Market Shares\n$9,400\n$9,200 +\nAgilent, 17%\n$9,000 +\n$8,800 +\nOther, 36%\nw\n& $8,600 +\n= $8,400 - Waters, 16%\n$8,200 + .\n$8,000 +\n$7,800 Shimadzu, 8%\n, 7 T Fi\nMerck KGaA/ a a\n$7,600 4 T T T T Sigma Aldrich,\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018E 10%\nSource: Company reports and Cowen and Company Source: Company reports and Cowen and Company\n\nFigure 16 Chromatography Market by Configuration\n\nH/UPLC GC IC LPLC Flash Other\n‘Market Leaders WAT A TO GE Teledyne\nA Shimadzu Metrohm BIO Biotage\nSource: Company reports and Cowen and Company\nCOWEN.COM 23\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024839\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This, too, can depend on the particu-\nlar domain of inquiry. Reasoning from all this takes practice as well.\nDetermining cause is a critical cognitive process that underlies nearly\nall thinking.\n\nHOW TO TEACH JUDGMENT\n\nHow do we get good at making a judgment? Judgments are a kind of\nprediction, of course. When a judge sentences a criminal, he is, in a\nsense, making a prediction about what will happen in the rest of this\nperson’s life. But he also is making decision that is no way a predic-\ntion, but simply serves as punishment. Similarly, when we decide that\na certain restaurant is our favorite, we are predicting something about\nhow much we will enjoy future experiences, but we also are making\na decision that may or may not matter to others, that is, a recom-\nmendation. Recommendations are also predictions, but they have a\ndifferent feel. When a boss decides whom to promote, he is predicting\nsomething about future behavior but, again, the prediction isn’t the\nkey point. A judgment is a decision that has some import.\n\nNevertheless, as different as judgments and predictions may or\nmay not be, the process of teaching them is identical. Good judg-\nment is learned by making judgments and analyzing the results or\ntruth of those judgments as more information becomes available. Af-\nter a judgment is made it too becomes one of one’s cases and stories.\nCases about judgment can be learned only by making simple judg-\nments and getting smarter about the process over time on the basis\nof experience.\n\nJudgments can be made in two ways that matter here. Either some-\none can decide to do one thing versus another thing based on ethical,\nmoral, avaricious, or emotional grounds, or for many other reasons.\nJudgments aren’t so different from decisions in this aspect. Teaching\nsomeone to make a judgment of this sort, between A and B, can be\ndone by putting students in situations in which such judgments need\nto be made and then going over with them how they decided and\nwhat they may have left out of their thinking.\n\nA different kind of judgment is made when one judges the behav-\nior of others. Judges do this, of course, as do compliance officers in\ncompanies, and teachers with respect to student mistakes.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023875\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Shihabi had served as Syria’s\nliaison officer with the UN force set up along the cease-fire line after the 1948\nwar. “Go check with the UN,” he said at our first meeting. “You'll see almost\nall the exchanges of fire in the late 1950s were provoked by Israel.” I didn’t\nrespond directly, though I did note it was the Syrians who had tried to divert\nwater from the Jordan River in the early fifties. “You did it first,” he retorted.\nSo it continued. Only later did we learn that while Muallem had sent back a\ngenerally encouraging impression from our garden talks, and his conclusion that\nIsrael was ready for substantive talks, he had neglected to convey our\nexpectation that any early progress would occur in informal exchanges. The\nresult was probably to raise General Shihabi’s expectations, which made him\nreluctant to show any real engagement.

We did not want to put\nconcessions on the record before we got an indication that the Syrians were\ngenuinely ready for peace talks.\n\nStill, the fact that we’d established the precedent of a “chief-of-staff\nchannel” was a step forward.

There was every sign that Hizbollah in Lebanon; and Hamas,\nIslamic Jihad and their supporters in Gaza and the West Bank, would escalate\nviolence and terror.

The next day,\nJanuary 4, 2017—little more than two weeks before the inauguration of his friend Donald\nTrump as the forty-fifth president—Ailes would be heading to Palm Beach, into a forced,\nbut he hoped temporary, retirement.\n\nSnow was threatening, and for a while the dinner appeared doubtful.

One of those phrases is \"topping from the bottom.” The\nother phrase is \"service top.”\n\n\"Topping from the bottom” indicates a person who exercises power in the relationship,\ndespite being in the \"bottom\" position. There's nothing wrong with doing that, as long as\nboth partners consent. But some people talk about \"topping from the bottom” like it's bad\n-- as if power ought to belong to one side or the other; as if the bottom should never\nexpress preferences or make decisions about what's going on. Which is ridiculous.\n\nI'll grant that it can be annoying if I'm trying to be a top, and my partner isn't listening or\nisn't doing what I want. But in those cases, it's important to pay attention to what is\nactually going on. Is my partner resisting because he actually doesn't want to do what\nwe're doing? In that case, I should respect his preferences. Or maybe my partner is\nresisting because he wants me to punish him. Or maybe we just have bad chemistry!\nWhatever. The point is, \"topping from the bottom” isn't inherently a bad thing. \"Topping\nfrom the bottom\" doesn't make the bottom into a \"bad submissive\" or whatever. It just\nmeans that either the person is trying to communicate, or the person is looking for a\ncertain kind of push-pull dynamic.\n\nSimultaneously, there's the phrase \"service top.\" It's basically the same thing in reverse. A\n\"service top\" is a top who enjoys topping in line with his partner's desires. And once\nagain, some people act like this is a bad thing -- as if service tops \"aren't dominant\nenough.” But it's not inherently a bad thing! Ifa service top is doing things just because\nher partner likes them... then good for her!\n\nI sometimes use phrases like \"topping from the bottom\" and \"service top\" to describe\ndynamics of a relationship: to talk about what is actually going on. But that's because I\ndon't think there's anything wrong with topping from the bottom or being a service top. I\ntry to avoid joking around about it unless I know that the person I'm talking to is not\nsensitive about the topic. And I really don't like it when people use those phrases while\nrole policing.\n\nBDSM can carry an incredible emotional charge, and a lot of the time, people will want\ncomfort and snuggles after doing BDSM together. Sometimes, part of that comfort and\nsnuggles includes reassuring the partner: \"I know you just beat the shit out of me until I\ncried; I enjoyed it -- I still like you and think you're a good person.\" Or, \"I know you\ncalled your safeword while I was hurting you; I still think you're a beautiful submissive\nand you did a great job -- in fact I love it when you call your safeword because it helps\nme understand you better.\" I think that in these cases it's totally okay to say something\nlike, \"You're such a good submissive.\" But it's so important to keep in mind that there\nisn't some kind of submission that's inherently \"better\" than any other kind -- or\ndominance that's \"better\" -- or sadism, masochism, whatever.\n\nAnd here is the part of the entry where I pull aside the mask and reveal that even though I\nclaimed I wouldn't talk about consent... I was secretly talking about consent all along!\n\nThe consent problem here is that role policing can be used to mess with people's\nconsent, because role policing can be used to pressure people.

Recall\nthat they partitioned the floor to document the exploratory motion in the context of a\nsequence of location transitions, readying the data for the computation of some of\nthe measures previously described.

This portfolio shift in positioning is happening but, in our view, is in its early\nstages.\n\nWe have moved from a \"get paid to wait\" core portfolio theme to a more cyclical and value-\noriented theme in multi-asset and all-equity portfolios primarily due to increased business and\nconsumer confidence, which should lead to higher earnings than originally expected.\n\n° Therefore, we have raised our exposure to equities versus fixed income to a moderate overweight and our new tactical\nasset allocation view is overweight equities versus its strategic benchmark.\n° We are now further underweight fixed income versus equities, underweight versus its strategic benchmark rather than\n\nneutral, and have lowered cash to neutral from overweight.\nWithin the asset classes, we have made a number of changes consistent with our view from earlier\nthis year and one that has accelerated post-election.\n\n° We are now moderately overweight U.S. small capitalization equities and neutral non-U.S. developed markets.\ne We maintain our preference for U.S. high-quality large caps and continue to overweight emerging markets.\n° We continue to favor value over growth and more cyclical areas (such as financials and consumer discretionary) versus\n\ndefensives (such as utilities and consumer staples).\nIn fixed income, we have moved from a balanced view to a larger underweight versus the strategic\nbenchmark.\n\n° However, fixed income still represents an important portfolio diversifier—and a volatility dampener in unforeseen\nworst-case scenarios—and should be viewed primarily as a cash flow producer versus a total return asset, given the expectations\nfor higher yields.\n\n° In addition, we have lowered Treasuries to a further underweight but maintain our neutral rating on high yield and\nunderweight on international fixed income.\n\n° Municipal bonds have corrected to levels that are becoming attractive again, and we are still favorable on investment\ngrade corporate credit.\n\n° We maintain our neutral rating on real estate and commodities, but we prefer metals and oil to gold.\n\nIn addition, the pro-cyclical improvement has started to break down the elevated correlation among\nand within asset classes since earlier in 2016. We expect this adjustment to continue in 2017 as\neconomic volatility picks up and asset class volatility follows suit. Transitions to late-cycle phases\ntend to invite a higher level of volatility as inflation rises and central bank policies shift to nudging\n\nshort rates higher.\n\nIn this environment, alternative investments, namely hedge funds, should outperform industry\nbenchmarks, in contrast to recent underperformance.

When you interviewed Brad two years ago you asked that i not tell him what a disaster lay before\nhim. what would you like me to tell Barry?\n\nThere is a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work that i\noutlined in my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years of mess on top. ( you can send it again if you\nlike ). Brad wechsler was never up to the task . sorry, I realize I have been saying the very same thing for a\nlong time. he was a not a step up from Eileen but a step sideways. in the beginning there was Eileen and\nTom and Ralph Lerner. all your hand picks. then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was chosen from a pool of 2\npeople. each that would be limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes i personally augmented his comp in order to get\nhim ) I did say hire both Lisa to do the bookkeeping and joslin tax, | He complained for over a year , re his\ndirection by eileen and ada , and then brad. His breakdown was not a surprise after months and moths of\nwarnings. Though disabled, he ran your office this year. with john and joe. He ran amok, and as i told\nyou he rarely failed to remind me in our conversations that you told him that he works for you and not for\nme and that brad needs to pays him .\n\n. Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc. :\n\nI have taken heat for years over the fact that 1 gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up\n\nquestions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. (that was Eileen _) but\nsomehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . _ when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the task, you\nbellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year , that by trying to protect\nyou from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his work. it then turns out\nthat he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and continued to make a really\ndangerous mess.. Joshn castrucci, in your eyes, was also my doing , though email after email said , I take no\nresponsibility for him,and 1YOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM |!!! , your response was that was my opinion\nwas only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan you told me he was gone. however he\ntoo is still there, and a waste of money and space.\n\nMy time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the foreign\nfunds repatriation plan that 1 had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions to make re\nmy time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit much time and\nmake any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced mess.\n\nThat being said, the tasks at hand are the following.\n\nYou have abomb of colored string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be very carefully\nunwound , even the substitution of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s It would\nbe much preferable if Wechsler was not his replacement. do you have any person you trust ??!. Iam\nconcermed re brad taking barrys place re XXXX. In the beginning Barry will need to find and learn\nACCURATE .. org charts. books , balance sheets . trust valuations. are alla part.

Craig Venter Institute (CVD, a not-\nfor-profit, research organization with approximately 300\nscientists and staff dedicated to human, microbial, plant,\nsynthetic and environmental genomic research, and the\nexploration of social and ethical issues in genomics.\n\nDr. Venter is also Founder and CEO of Synthetic\nGenomics Inc (SGI), a privately held company dedicated\nto commercializing genomic-driven solutions to address\nglobal needs such as new sources of energy, new food and\nnutritional products, and next generation vaccines.\n\nDr. Venter began his formal education after a tour\nof duty as a Navy Corpsman in Vietnam from 1967 to 1968.\nAfter earning both a Bachelor’s degree in Biochemistry and a\nPh.D. in Physiology and Pharmacology from the University of\nCalifornia at San Diego, he was appointed professor at the State\nUniversity of New York at Buffalo and the Roswell Park Cancer\nInstitute. In 1984, he moved to the National Institutes of\nHealth campus where he developed Expressed Sequence Tags\nor ESTs, a revolutionary new strategy for rapid gene discovery.\nIn 1992 Dr. Venter founded The Institute for Genomic\nResearch (TIGR, now part of JCVI), a not-for-profit research\ninstitute, where in 1995 he and his team decoded the genome\nof the first free-living organism, the bacterium Haemophilus\n\ninfluenzae, using his new whole genome shotgun technique.\n\nIn 1998, Dr. Venter founded Celera Genomics\nto sequence the human genome using new tools and\ntechniques he and his team developed. This research\nculminated with the February 2001 publication of the human\ngenome in the journal, Science. He and his team at Celera\nalso sequenced the fruit fly, mouse and rat genomes.\n\nDr. Venter and his team at JCVI continue to blaze\nnew trails in genomics. They have sequenced and analyzed\nhundreds of genomes, and have published numerous\nimportant papers covering such areas as environmental\ngenomics, the first complete diploid human genome, and the\ngroundbreaking advance in creating the first self-replicating\nbacterial cell constructed entirely with synthetic DNA.\n\nDr. Venter is one of the most frequently cited\nscientists, and the author of more than 250 research articles.\nHe is also the recipient of numerous honorary degrees,\npublic honors, and scientific awards, including the 2008\nUnited States National Medal of Science, the 2002 Gairdner\nFoundation International Award, the 2001 Paul Ehrlich and\nLudwig Darmstaedter Prize and the King Faisal International\nAward for Science.

Yet that path leads only to further the cause of the enemy.\n\n5. Perhaps most telling of all of McDonough’s statement is the word “never.” To claim we will never be at war\nwith Islam regardless of what Islam or Muslims worldwide do to us is the height of Dhimmitude—a phrase coined\nby Bat Yeor, an expert on Dhimmi behavior throughout Islamic history. In Islam, a Dhimmi is generally a Jew or\nChristian (there are others) who has agreed to accept a lesser and humiliating status with duties including the\npayment of a special tax, in exchange for life in an Islamic controlled land. It is a protection contract: you can\nlive as long as you abide by these conditions. In claiming that we could “never” be at war with Islam, McDonough\nhas staked out Dhimmi status for all non-Muslims in the U.S. and has put words to the famous act of Obama in\nbowing to the King of Saudi Arabia.\n\nBy denying that we are at war with Islam, McDonough has admitted that those words have meaning, just that\nthey do not fit U.S. policy. By denying that the U.S. would ever be at war with Islam, McDonough has sent the\nmessage of unconditional surrender in advance. This is pure Control Factor maneuvering and threatens our nation\nworse than the underlying threat itself. Put simply, our Constitution does not afford us easy ways to combat the\nthreat we face- we can fight certain types of terrorism in certain (albeit still under great dispute) ways yet we\nhave no effective means to combat the Civilization Jihad and are fast losing leverage to resist the International\nInstitutional Jihad.

Regulatory Procedures\n\nA. Regulatory Flexibility Act\n\nThe Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980\n(RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., requires\nagencies promulgating final rules to\nprepare a final regulatory flexibility\nanalysis and to develop alternatives\n\n188 San Diego Bldg. Trades Council v. Garmon,\n359 U.S. 236, 244 (1959)\n\n189 Because I find the rule is invalid, I find it\nunnecessary to comment on the content of the\nnotice or the consequences, other than finding an\nunfair labor practice, if an employer fails to post the\nrequired notice. For the reasons stated in my\ndissenting opinion in /. Picini Flooring, 356 NLRB\nNo. 9 (2010), I also disagree with the rule’s\nrequirement that certain employers must also\nelectronically distribute the notice.\n\nwherever possible, when drafting\nregulations that will have a significant\nimpact on a substantial number of small\nentities. The focus of the RFA is to\nensure that agencies ‘‘review draft rules\nto assess and take appropriate account\nof the potential impact on small\nbusinesses, small governmental\njurisdictions, and small organizations,\nas provided by the [RFA].” E.O. 13272,\nSec. 1, 67 FR 53461 (‘Proper\nConsideration of Small Entities in\nAgency Rulemaking’’). However, an\nagency is not required to prepare a final\nregulatory flexibility analysis for a final\ntule if the agency head certifies that the\nrule will not, if promulgated, have a\nsignificant economic impact on a\nsubstantial number of small entities. 5\nU.S.C. 605(b). Based on the analysis\nbelow, in which the Board has\nestimated the financial burdens to\nemployers subject to the NLRA\nassociated with complying with the\nrequirements contained in this final\ntule, the Board has certified to the Chief\nCounsel for Advocacy of the Small\nBusiness Administration (SBA) that this\nrule will not have a significant\neconomic impact on a substantial\nnumber of small entities.\n\nThe primary goal of this rule is\nnotifying employees of their rights\nunder the NLRA. This goal is achieved\nthrough the posting of notices by\nemployers subject to the NLRA of the\nrights of employees under the NLRA.\nThe Board will make the notices\navailable at no cost to employers; there\nare no information collection, record\nkeeping, or reporting requirements.\n\nThe Board estimates that in order to\ncomply with this rule, each employer\nsubject to the NLRA will spend a total\nof 2 hours during the first year in which\nthe rule is in effect. This includes 30\nminutes for the employer to learn where\nand how to post the required notices, 30\nminutes to acquire the notices from the\nBoard or its Web site, and 60 minutes\nto post them physically and\nelectronically, depending on where and\nhow the employer customarily posts\nnotices to employees. The Board\nassumes that these activities will be\nperformed by a professional or business\nworker, who, according to Bureau of\nLabor Statistics data, earned a total\nhourly wage of about $32.20 in March\n2011, including fringe benefits.19° The\n\n199 Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of\nLabor Statistics, “Economic News Release,” Table\nB-8, June 3, 2011 (available at http://www.bis.gov).\n(The Board is administratively informed that BLS\nestimates that fringe benefits are approximately\nequal to 40 percent of hourly wages. Thus, to\ncalculate total average hourly earnings, BLS\nmultiplies average hourly wages by 1.4. In March,\n2011, average hourly wages for professional and\n\nBoard then multiplied this figure by\n\n2 hours to estimate the average costs for\nemployers to comply with this rule\nduring the first year in which the rule\nis in effect. Accordingly, this rule is\nestimated to impose average costs of\n$64.40 per employer subject to the\nNLRA (2 hours x $32.20) during the first\nyear.191 These costs will decrease\ndramatically in subsequent years\nbecause the only employers affected\nwill be those that did not previously\nsatisfy their posting requirements or that\nhave since expanded their facilities or\nestablished new ones. Because the final\nrule will not require employers to post\nthe notice by email, instant messaging,\ntext messaging, and the like, the cost of\ncompliance should be, if anything,\nsomewhat less than the Board\npreviously estimated.\n\nAccording to the United States Census\nBureau, there were approximately 6\nmillion businesses with employees in\n2007. Of those, the SBA estimates that\nall but about 18,300 were small\nbusinesses with fewer than 500\nemployees.192 This rule does not apply\nto employers that do not meet the\nBoard’s jurisdictional requirements, but\n\nbusiness workers were $23.00. Table B-8.\nAccordingly, the Board multiplied that number by\n1.4 to arrive at its estimate of $32.20 average hourly\nearnings, including fringe benefits.) In the NPRM,\nthe Board estimated hourly earnings of $31.02,\nbased on BLS data from January 2009. 75 FR 80415.\nThe estimate has been updated to reflect increases\nin hourly earnings since that time. Those increases\nhave been relatively minor, and do not affect the\nBoard’s conclusion that the economic impact of the\nrule will not be significant; see discussion below.\n191 The National Roofing Contractors Association\nasserts (without support) that “federal agencies\nhave a notoriously poor track record in estimating\nthe costs of new regulations on businesses”; it\ntherefore predicts that “the actual cost for many\nemployers could be considerably higher.” The\nBoard recognizes that some employers, generally\nfirms with extensive and/or multiple facilities, may\nincur initial compliance costs in excess of the\nBoard’s estimate. For example, a company with\nmultiple locations may require more than 30\nminutes to physically post the notices on all of its\nvarious bulletin boards. The Board’s estimate,\nhowever, is an average for all employers; many\nsmall employers, especially those with only one\nfacility and/or limited electronic communication\nwith employees, may incur lower compliance costs.\nIn this regard, however, contrary to numerous\ncomments, such as that of St Mar Enterprises, Inc.,\nthe Board does not expect that the rule will be\n“very burdensome” for businesses with more than\none facility. Normally, such firms should have to\nlearn about the rule’s requirements and acquire the\nnotices only once, no matter how many facilities are\ninvolved. The same should be true for electronic\nposting: downloading the notice and posting it on\nan employer’s Web site normally should have to be\ndone once for all facilities. Thus, the only\nadditional costs involved for multi-facility firms\nshould be those of physically posting the notices at\neach facility.\n192 Source: SBA Office of Advocacy estimates\nbased on data from the U.S. Department of\nCommerce, Bureau of the Census, and trends from\nthe U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor\nStatistics, Business Employment Dynamics.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022313\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Thus, it is\nproper for the Board to consider a\nknowing and willful failure to post the\nnotice as evidence of unlawful motive.\nHowever, the Board has noticed that\nit employed somewhat inconsistent\nlanguage in the NPRM regarding the\nconsideration of failure to post the\nnotice as evidence of antiunion animus.\nThus, the caption of paragraph\n104.214(b) reads: “Knowing\nnoncompliance as evidence of unlawful\nmotive.’ However, the paragraph itself\nstates that “If an employer has actual or\nconstructive knowledge of the\nrequirement to post the notice and fails\nor refuses to do so, the Board may\nconsider such a willful refusal as\nevidence of unlawful motive in a case\nin which motive is an issue.”’ (Emphasis\nadded in both cases.) 75 FR at 80420. In\nthe preamble to the NPRM, the Board\nreferred only to knowing noncompliance\nas evidence of unlawful motive. 75 FR\nat 80414-80415. On reflection, the\nBoard wishes to clarify this provision to\nstate that, to be considered as evidence\nof unlawful motive, an employer’s\nfailure to post the notice must be both\nknowing and willful—i.e., the employer\nmust have actual (as opposed to\nconstructive) knowledge of the rule and\nyet refuse, on no cognizable basis, to\npost the notice. The Board is revising\nthe language of the rule accordingly.\nThe comment that prompted these\nrevisions urges that there should be no\nadverse consequences for the employer\nthat does not post the notice because it\nhas a good-faith (but, implicitly,\nerroneous) belief that it is not covered\nby the NLRA.62 The Board rejects this\ncontention as it pertains to finding the\nfailure to post to be an unfair labor\npractice or grounds for tolling the 10(b)\nperiod. Failure to post the notice\ninterferes with employees’ NLRA rights\nregardless of the reason for the failure;\ngood faith, though commendable, is\nirrelevant.163 Additionally, tolling is\n\n162 One example could be an employer that\nbelieves that it is subject to the Railway Labor Act\nand not to the NLRA.\n\n163 This is so in other areas of NLRA law. For\nexample, an employer who coercively interrogates\nor disciplines an individual concerning his or her\nunion activities violates the NLRA if the individual\nis a statutory employee, even though the employer\nmay have honestly believed that the individual was\na statutory supervisor and not protected by the\nNLRA. Also, absent compelling economic\ncircumstances, an employer that is testing the\nBoard’s certification of a newly-selected union in\nthe court of appeals makes unilateral changes in\nunit employees’ terms and conditions of\nemployment at its peril; if the court affirms the\ncertification, the unilateral changes violate NLRA\nSection 8(a)(5) even if the employer believed in\ngood faith that the certification was inappropriate.\n\nconcerned with fairness to the\nemployee, and these fairness concerns\nare unaffected by the employer’s good or\nbad faith; as previously noted, notice\nposting tolling is fundamentally\ndifferent from tolling based upon\nemployer misconduct. However, an\nemployer that fails to post the notice\nonly because it honestly but erroneously\nbelieves that it is not subject to the\nNLRB’s jurisdiction does not thereby\nindicate that it is hostile to employees’\nNLRA rights, but only that it believes\nthat those rights do not apply in the\nemployer’s workplace. In such a case,\nthe employer’s good faith normally\nshould preclude finding the failure to\npost to be willful or evidence of\nantiunion animus.\n\nACC contends that even though the\ntule states that only a “willful” failure\nto post the notice may be considered\nevidence of unlawful motive, in practice\nthe Board will always infer at least\nconstructive notice from the publication\nof the rule in the Federal Register and\nthe maxim that “ignorance of the law is\nno excuse.” 164 The Board rejects this\ncontention. The quoted maxim means\nonly that an employer’s actual lack of\nknowledge of the rule would not excuse\nits failure to post the notice. It would,\nhowever, undercut any suggestion that\nthe failure to post was willful and\ntherefore indicative of unlawful motive.\n\nContrary to numerous comments,'®>\nfinding a willful failure to post the\nnotice as evidence of animus is not the\nsame as adopting a ‘‘presumption of\nanimus” or “‘presumption of unlawful\nmotive.” There is no such presumption.\nThe Board’s general counsel would have\nthe burden of proving that a failure to\npost was willful. In any event, a willful\nfailure to post would not be conclusive\nproof of unlawful motive, but merely\nevidence that could be considered,\nalong with other evidence, in\ndetermining whether the general\ncounsel had demonstrated unlawful\nmotive.166 Likewise, contrary to the\ncontentions of ALFA and AHCA, the\nBoard will not assume that any failure\n\nMike O’Connor Chevrolet, 209 NLRB 701, 703\n(1974), enf. denied on other grounds 512 F.2d 684\n(8th Cir. 1975).\n\n164 See also comment of American Health Care\nAssociation (AHCA).\n\n165 See, e.g., comments of FMI and COLLE.\n\n166 The Georgetown law students ask whether, if\nfailure to post the notice may be found to be an\nunfair labor practice and also may be considered\nevidence of antiunion animus, such a failure could\n“satisfy an element of its own violation.” The\nanswer is no, because the failure to post, whether\nknowing or inadvertent, would be an unfair labor\npractice regardless of motive; knowing and willful\nfailure to post would be relevant only in cases such\nas those alleging unlawful discipline, discharge, or\nrefusal to hire, in which motive is an element of the\nviolation.\n\nto post the notice is intentional and\nmeant to prevent employees of learning\ntheir rights.\n\nD. Other Comments\n\nThe Board received many comments\nasserting that if the proposed\nenforcement scheme for failure to post\nthe required notice is adopted, union\nadherents will tear down the notices in\norder to harass employers and,\nparticularly, to vitiate 10(b).167 These\ncomments express the concern that\ntolling the 10(b) period will lead to a\nflood of unfair labor practice charges,\nand that, to avoid that eventuality,\nemployers will have to incur significant\ncosts of policing the postings and/or\ninstalling expensive tamper-proof\nbulletin boards.168 In the absence of\nexperience with such postings, the\nBoard deems these concerns speculative\nat this time. If particular employers\nexperience such difficulties, the Board\nwill deal with them on a case-by-case\nbasis. However, as explained above,\ntolling is an equitable matter, and if an\nemployer has posted the notice and\ntaken reasonable steps to insure that it\nremains posted, it is unlikely that the\nBoard would find tolling appropriate.\n\nCalifornia Chamber and NCAE ask the\nBoard to specify the ‘‘additional\nremedies” that may be imposed in the\nevent of a notice posting violation.\n104.213(a). The Board has broad\ndiscretion in crafting remedies for\nviolations of the NLRA. NLHB v. Seven-\nUp Bottling Co. of Miami, 344 U.S. 344,\n346 (1953). The remedies imposed in a\ngiven case depend on the nature of the\nviolations and the particular facts in the\ncase. The Board declines to speculate as\nto every possible remedy that might be\nimposed in every imaginable set of\ncircumstances.\n\nSeveral comments protest that\nemployers could be fined for failing to\npost the notice; several others contend\nthat the Board should levy fines instead\nof imposing the proposed remedies.

[I]t is when the\ndomestic currency appreciates, financial conditions in that country loosen,\nand CIP deviations narrow... [A] strengthening of US dollar has adverse\nimpacts on bank balance sheets, which, in turn, reduces banks’ risk bearing\ncapacity.’ The findings of this paper are consistent with two of the points\nmade above, that we may re-enter a phase that is not that positive for EM\ncurrencies and that the dominance of the dollar as an international currency\nis having unintended consequences for the rest of the world, out of line with\nthe local fundamentals.\n\nTrump and Europe.

We read the interview you gave a few years back. There can\nbe no doubt that we absolutely appreciate the probably unwanted media attention that your previous\ninterview drew. We are not at all looking for a second round of that. We are not the media. We do not\nneed any public interview.

We just want to speak with you.\n\ncame back to the United States to help others similarly victimized. Specifically, she started a non-\nprofit charity to help sex abuse victims. She very bravely told her story with the goal of starting a new life\nhelping others. Unfortunately, Ms. Maxwell told the world that was lying, which has thus far had\nthe impact of destroying E's charity. We are in litigation with Ms. Maxwell where we have to prove\nsomething that should be very simple - that I is in fact telling the truth in her story of being\nrecruited by Ms. Maxwell to travel and \"work\" for Mr. Epstein. We know she is being truthful. We also\nknow that there are numerous witnesses who also know she is. But many of the witnesses still work for\nMr. Epstein or cannot be located.\n\na. as well as any others similarly situated - deserves the truth. And that is all we are trying to\ncapture for her. We promise not to let anyone in the media know we are talking to you. We are not\nlooking to drag you into anything. We are not looking for anything at all more than the truth, and Virginia\nhas told us that of all the people who worked for Mr. Epstein you were the most likely to help.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022996\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We headed straight downstairs just past\nthe massage room and gym there is an indoor heated pool, shower and\nspa. First Jeffrey wanted to warm up in the spa underneath a decorated\nceiling of clouds and blue skies. Starting the massage in the spa | rubbed\nhis feet while he reclined into the spa’s jets. We spoke of the museum and\nsome of the knick-knacks I had bought and I thanked him for the\nturquoise earrings and necklace he had got for me as a gift, joking about\nnot ever knowing what to get for him, being that he was richest man I'd\never known. By no far means did we ever have any kind of a mutua\nrespectful bond between us, but there was a significant softer side he\nbegan to share with me that was different from how he treated his other\ngirls. Maybe it was my feet that filled the shoes for that time being, or the\nfact my novelty hadn’t worn off yet, but what ever it was 1 was getting\nconfused from the double-sided life I was leading.\n\nHe got up from the spa tub shortly thereafter and asked me to come\nwash him in the shower. It was nothing unordinary to me, I was used to\nhis need to be nurtured and pampered. | performed his request with a\ncheerful mannerism, letting him think I was taking care of him out of my\nsheer sweetness. | got the towels ready for him to get out of the shower\nand towel dried him, patting his skin instead of rubbing as previously\ninstructed. “You know you have a very maternal instinct, you'll make a\nfine mother someday”, he would constantly acclaim at my gentleness. “I\nhope so” I replied, 1 would love to have my own babies one day, but not\nany time soon”. Laughing at the very thought of that.\n\nWe walked up the steps and through the French doors into the gym’s\nadjoining massage room, It was smaller room than in his other houses,\nplacing the emphasis on the large massage bed in the center. I grabbed\nanother clean towel to keep him warm while I prepared the music, lights,\nand oils. He liked me to use mostly lavender or other aromatherapy\nscents, which reminded me of woodlands in the spring. Always enjoying\nthe beginning of the massage, I put my heart and soul into training in my\nprofession. I could just close my eyes I would see only with my hands the\nareas that needed the most work, and even though I wasn’t a professional\nyet, Jeffrey could feel and told me there wasn’t many that could please\nhim during a massage being untrained. I’m sure now it was just\n\n47\n\n©] Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004180\n\nsomething he’d say nice to all the girls, but in the time I had known him I\ncould honestly say it wasn’t like him to compliment girls in any other\nway than regards to a sexual performance or their looks. I was flattered at\nhis praise and when the massage was over, so were the sentiments. I was\nback to being used for my body and what I could do with it.\n\nWith him satisfied and off for a nap, I could go do what ever I wanted,\nlike usually 1 would go down to the stables or something adventurous, but\ntoday T was ina melancholy mood, just wanting to relax and unwind\nmyself in a giant tub in my bathroom. | got out some of the oils I used on\nJeffrey putting them in the steaming water and popped two of my Xanax\npills, forgetting about my troubles and focusing on the quiet moment at\nhand, just wanting to soak up the peacefilness of it. Nearly slipping away\nto sleep in the tub, I was startled when I got the call on the intercom to\ncome down for dinner.\n\nEverybody seemed in good spirits at dinner, which helped to lift mine.\nWe all ate our meals and went into the movie room to watch a newly\nreleased movie. It was a ritualistic scenario, most nights that everyone\nwas at ease we would all sit in one of his various located movie rooms\nand hang out together. Just as he always would Jeffrey asked Emmy and\nme to both grab a foot during the movie that night and just keep\nmassaging through the film. We were always on call for duty, no matter\nwhere we were or what ever time it was. He would just plop a foot up or\npass over his hand at any given time and require a massage, even if the\nfilm went on for over two hours, I would still be required to sit on the\nfloor rubbing his feet or hands, and even his scalp at times. After the\ncredits had rolled Ghislane got up to close the door to the room and I\nknew she had received the signals herself and would proceed to\nmanipulate, violate, and use us to satisfy Jeffrey’s urges once more before\nhe went to bed.\n\nThe blue illumination from the empty T.V screen was glaring in the\ntenebrous room as we watched her undress in a light that relied on the\nreflection of the moon through the windows peek to show it’s proceeding\ndisplay. She walked back to the sofa where I was sitting at Jeffrey’s feet\nstill rubbing away and uncovered her shirt displaying ample bosoms for\nhis appeal. Approaching me like a lioness hunting her prey she stood me\nup and led me to the other couch across from Jeffrey and situated herself\non top of me, sliding her fingers through my dress to unbutton my attire,\nrevealing my girlish figure and two small peaks. Pushing my head into\nher breasts I was being fondled by Emmy at the same time, which took\nher cue when she saw Ghislane look in my direction. From an occasional\nglance upwards, [ could see that Jeffrey was up to his methodical foreplay\nstroking his manhood while watching the build up to his main event.\nThey both took turns making me moan from their touches and when\n\n48\n\n{] Copyright Protected Material\n\nGLUPFREO04 181\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021168\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Ideally, the process which had begun with Oslo\nmight start to disentangle it, though I remained far from confident that anything\nresembling full peace would come any time soon.\n\nRabin, and even more acutely Shimon Peres, believed it was important to\npress ahead with the opening phase of the handover of Israeli authority mapped\nout by Oslo. In May 1994, a draft of the so-called “Gaza and Jericho First”\nagreement was completed. Once it was ratified, the five-year interim period\nwould begin, with further withdrawals and parallel negotiations on the\n“permanent status” of the territories. In this first step, Israel would transfer civil\nauthority in Gaza Strip and the Jordan Valley town of Jericho to the\nPalestinians, and local security would be in the hands of a newly created\nPalestinian police force.\n\nMy primary concern, and my responsibility, was the security provisions in\nthe agreement, since the Israeli army retained its role in charge of overall\nsecurity. When I went to see Rabin a few days before the cabinet meeting to\napprove the Gaza-Jericho agreement, I told him I was worried that it left room\nfor potentially serious misunderstandings, friction and even clashes on the\nground. There was no clear definition of how our soldiers would operate\nalongside the new local police in the event of a terror attack, violence by Hamas\nor Islamic Jihad, or, for that matter, a car crash involving an Israeli and a\nPalestinian.

But there\nare circumstances where catharsis is completely acceptable. Lots of perfectly decent men\nhave urges towards violent dominance; what do they do about it? How much do they\nagonize, like Christian Grey in Fifty Shades of Grey, and how much do they explore their\ndesires in a consensual and reasonable way?\n\nI always thought that the late-90s movie Fight Club was fascinating primarily because of\nits lens on masculinity and violence. It's not just about the violence men to do each other,\nbut to themselves. Quotes include \"You have to give up; you have to know that someday\nyou're gonna die,\" and \"The first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club.”\nI first watched it before I knew much about S&M, but now whenever I think about it, I\nthink about how the idea of a fight club -- where people would get together and fight, for\ncatharsis and community -- is so very reminiscent of how a lot of people experience\nS&M. Fight Club even has safewords. Someone says stop, you stop. I obviously don't\nsupport the endpoint of the Fight Club story (1.e., blowing up buildings), but the idea of\nestablishing a men's community via a fight club seems reasonable to me.\n\nSo, what are the practicalities of dealing with aggressive or dominant tendencies in the\nsexual arena? As an S&M person, I've experimented with dominance as well as\nsubmission, but because violence is so associated with masculinity, I turned to some\negalitarian male S&Mers for advice. I believe that even for non-S&M people, their\nperspectives make a really good lens for ideas of gender and violence and power. Of\ncourse, the first thing one of my friends told me was: \"I'm not sure I really see dominance\nin general as being particularly masculine. I don't really think it's a gender associated\nthing.”\n\nThat gentleman, who comments around the Internet under the name Scootah, went on to\nadd: \"I've certainly worried about my kinks in the past. I mean fundamentally, I get\nreally, really turned on by grabbing someone by the hair, throwing them into the wall,\nbackhanding them, etc. That's a pretty disturbing thought for an egalitarian who's worked\nwith abuse victims. I spend a lot of time considering the ethics of my kinks; my partners’\nenthusiastic consent is a major priority.\"\n\nJay Wiseman, author of the famous S&M primer $101, talks about his own early fears\ntowards the beginning of that book. He writes about how he began having sadistic\nfantasies, and went to the public library to research them. All he could find was portraits\nof serial killers, which scared the hell out of him. He writes:\n\nI decided to keep myself under surveillance. I made up my mind that I was not going to\nhurt anybody. If I thought I was turning into someone that would harm somebody else,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018551\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This report is intended for amanda.ens@baml.com\nUS\nExtract alpha from summer SPX range as policy and positioning “collar” equities\nWith the Federal Reserve last week appearing more emboldened to normalize monetary\npolicy, risk asset bears have come out in force. While we agree that a changing Fed\nreaction function is likely not supportive of substantial equity upside, we think the\n“Yellen put” still exists, albeit with a lower strike. Hence, we see monetary policy as\nproviding a near-term “collar” (long put/short call) on a US equity market already prone\nto getting trapped in record-tight trading ranges. Further impetus for a summer rangetrade\nshould come from (i) fiscal policy, as gridlock caps equity upside but policy hope\nfloors the downside, and (ii) positioning, where the risk of continued “fragility events”\n(potentially exacerbated by stretched quant fund/short vol positioning) meets cashed-up\ninvestors still accustomed to buying dips. As a risk-limited range trade, we like buying\nin-the-money down and out puts on the S&P. For example, an SPX Sep 2475 put that\nknocks out at 2300 (6% OTM) indicatively costs 70bps (spot ref 2451), a 60% discount\nto the 2475 / 2300 put spread.\nEurope\nLong EU banks dispersion: Buy Dec17 call on a basket, sell worst-of call\nWe recommend positioning for greater dispersion in EU bank sector returns via buying a\nDec17 105% call on an equally-weighted basket of Santander, BNP, ING, Intesa and\nDeutsche Bank, part-financed by selling a worst-of call on the same basket for 1.8%\n(net) indic., as: 1) improving macro/earnings, sensitivity to rates and regulatory\nheadwinds are likely to lead to greater differentiation within banks, 2) the entry point is\nattractive given historically low implied vol (13 th 8y+ percentile) and high implied\ncorrelation (81% bid vs latest 6M realised correl of 66%), 3) historical risk-reward at\ncurrent pricing is attractive (avg. P&L of +8.4% when positive vs -1.8% when negative),\nand 4) the trade can be considered as a cheap call on EU equities as it has a similar\npayoff profile but with greater benefit relative to its cost.\nAsia\nBuy depressed China vs. US risks through corridor variance spreads\nAs global central banks have taken on more hawkish tones, the uncertainty surrounding\npolicy tightening will be more positive for EM volatility than for DM volatility.\nAdditionally, our strategists have a more bearish outlook for the Chinese banking sector\n(which makes up a majority of the HSCEI index) amid rapidly rising leverage, complex\nshadow banking, and excessive home price inflation. Since we believe the global\nsynchronized monetary tightening will impact HSCEI volatility more than SPX volatility,\nwe recommend owning HSCEI-SPX 70/110% corridor variance at 5 vol points, a 3 vol\npoint discount to a vanilla variance spread. The entry point is attractive as the HSCEI-\nSPX 18-month variance swap spread has fallen back to the lower-end of its 5-year\ntrading range, the trade has a positive carry, and it benefits during China risk-off events.\n>> Employed by a non-US affiliate of MLPF&S and is not registered/qualified as a research analyst under\nthe FINRA rules.\nRefer to \"Other Important Disclosures\" for information on certain BofA Merrill Lynch entities that take\nresponsibility for this report in particular jurisdictions.\nBofA Merrill Lynch does and seeks to do business with issuers covered in its research reports.

Breakeven rates of inflation narrowed following the Fed communications\ndue to tighter monetary conditions in the face of slowing US economic data, and risk\nasset bears responded in force, suggesting that Janet Yellen had “broken up” with\ninvestors and that it would be prudent to sell “before it’s too late”.\nWe agree that the changing reaction function of the Fed is likely not supportive of\nfurther substantial US equity upside and may be viewed as the Fed now providing a\nshort call option on the S&P 500. However, in our view, it is premature to conclude\nfrom last week’s developments that the “Yellen put” is dead. We see its strike as\ndeclining but would not underestimate Yellen’s dovish inclinations in a shock or the\ncapacity for the Fed to still remain credibly on hold as long as the US economy is not\n“running hot”.\nIn short, we see monetary policy as now providing a “collar” (long put / short call) on a\nUS equity market that has already shown a propensity over the past year for getting\ntrapped in record tight trading ranges. 1 Other factors may also conspire to create a\nsummer range-trade for US equities, namely (i) fiscal policy, where gridlock likely caps\nequity upside but lingering policy hope floors the downside, and (ii) positioning, where\nthe risk of continued “fragility events” (potentially exacerbated by stretched quant\nfund/short vol positioning) meets cashed-up investors still accustomed to buying dips.\nTug of war between fragile market/stretched positioning and cashed-up dip-buyers\nAs we have noted recently, US equities have displayed a historically unusual tendency to\njump rapidly from calm to stress and back (“fragility”), with the recent Tech sell-off and\nrebound the latest example. For example, in the past year, the S&P 500 has seen\n5sigma declines (3 in total—Brexit, Sep-16, May-17) occur 20x more frequently than\nover the prior 90 years or so. The increased frequency of these “fragility events” is in\npart due to vol failing to remain high post a spike as equity market participants continue\nto aggressively “buy the dip” and in the process reset vol lower.\nHistorically low vol alongside consistently upward trending equity markets and low cross\nasset correlations could be creating stretched positioning across markets. For example,\nupward trending equities on historically low vol may be pushing CTA equity positioning\nto near record levels (Chart 7). Risk parity portfolios could be increasing their leverage\ndue to low vol as well as low cross asset correlation (Chart 8). And lastly, inverse VIX\nETPs have seen increased open interest as performance has swelled on the back of\ncontinued declines in vol and attractive term structure risk premia (Chart 9).\nShould vol spike again alongside a reversal in equity price momentum and a rise in cross\nasset correlations, then unwinds from these strategies could exacerbate market fragility.\nHowever, this must be weighed against an investor base that has plenty of cash on hand\n(Chart 10) and their potentially fickle but still-intact tendency to view any equity market\ndip as an alpha opportunity.\n1\nFor example, the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded in its tightest trading range in over\n110 years in Jan-17; this followed a record in the S&P 500 ending Sep-16 for the longest\nstretch of trading within a range of 1.77% since 1928.\n4 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 20 June 2017\nChart 7: A combination of upward trending global equity markets and\nvery low volatility have conspired to push trend following (CTA) equity\npositioning to near record levels. Consequently, the beta of CTA\nstrategies to global equities is also at extreme levels\nChart 8: Owing to low cross asset vol and strong diversification, the\nvolatility of risk-balanced multi-asset portfolios has fallen to historically\nlow levels. Consequently, leverage levels across multi-asset & other\nportfolios that target fixed vol have likely hit their caps\n1.00\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n0.00\n-0.25\n-0.50\n-0.75\n-1.00\nJan-15\nMar-15\nMay-15\nJul-15\nSep-15\nNov-15\nJan-16\nMar-16\nMay-16\nJul-16\nSep-16\nNov-16\nJan-17\nMar-17\nMSCI World (Ratio of trend strength to volatility) (LHS)\nBofAML Model CTA Global Equity Allocation (RHS)\nMay-17\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n-20\n24%\n20%\n16%\n12%\n8%\n4%\n0%\n1972\n1975\n1978\n1981\n1984\n1987\n1990\n1993\n1996\n1999\n2002\n2005\n2008\n2011\n2014\n2017\nModel Risk Parity Leverage (Vol Target: 10% & Max Leverage: 3x) (RHS)\nUnlevered BofAML Model Risk Parity Volatility (LHS)\n3.0x\n2.5x\n2.0x\n1.5x\n1.0x\n0.5x\n0.0x\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.

For example, the SPX Sep 2475 put with a 2300 knock-out (continuous\nobservation) indicatively costs 70bps (spot ref 2451) and offers a 60% discount to the\nvanilla 2475/2300 put spread, which is itself historically cheap (Chart 12).\nIf SPX stays above the 2300 barrier at all points in time before expiry, the structure is\nequivalent to a 2475 put option. If the barrier is instead breached, the maximum loss\nwill be equal to the (low) upfront premium. The 2300 barrier is about 6% out-of-themoney,\nhence “allows” for the elusive 5% correction not seen since Brexit (on a closing\nbasis). However, investors can mitigate the risk of breaching the barrier by either\nmoving it farther down (e.g., a 2245 barrier would indicatively raise the cost from 0.7%\nto 1%), or by only observing it on a close-to-close basis (in turn sacrificing part of the\ndiscount).\n6.0%\n5.5%\n5.0%\n4.5%\n4.0%\n3.5%\nBacktest Actual\n3.0%\n'01 '02 '03 '04 '05 '06 '07 '08 '09 '10 '11 '12 '13 '14 '15 '16 '17\n2400\n2200\n2000\n1800\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\nFMS avg cash balance (%)\nS&P 500 (RHS)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Fund Manager Survey, Bloomberg.

However, we think the tide may be turning as last week, the Fed,\nECB, and BOE all delivered policy announcements with hawkish tones. How far they\nreally go to tighten policy when economic data is weakening still remains unknown.\nHowever, we think the uncertainty surrounding tightening will be more positive for EM\nvolatility than for DM volatility.\nChinese banks: Rapid increase in leverage is a big concern\nThe HSCEI currently has a 70% weight in the financial sector. Recently, BofAML analyst\nWinnie Wu turned very bearish on the sector as (1) leverage has rapidly increased—debt\nto GDP rose by 18% in 2016 and may go above 300% by 2019, (2) shadow banking has\nbecome too big, too complicated, and too levered to easily regulate—even at the\nhighest quality bank, China Merchants, off-balance sheet wealth management products\n(WMP) have grown to 40% the size of on-balance sheet assets from just 18% two years\nago, and (3) excessive home price inflation—low and middle-income households are late\nto the party and a correction in prices could have a systemic effect as property assets\nhave been used as collateral in WMPs.\nSPX: The Fed is now “collaring” the market\nSince the global financial crisis the Fed has been well known for providing a put option\nby its willingness to step in during periods of market stress. However, post the Fed\nmeeting last week, it appears the central bank has decided to cap its monetary support\nas some FOMC members seem worried that financial conditions are too loose.\nEffectively, the market is now “collared” (more so for the SPX compared to EM) as the\ndownside is protected by the Fed put (though with a lower strike price) while the upside\nis capped by log-jammed fiscal policy and positioning, where the risk of quant funds\nselling record equity positions meets cashed-up investors still accustomed to buyingthe-dip.\nThe depressed implied China vs. US risks should reverse\nWith the steep drop in global risk premium, the HSCEI-SPX 18-month variance swap\nspread has fallen back to the lower-end of its 5-year trading range. Since we believe the\nglobal synchronized monetary tightening will impact HSCEI volatility more than SPX\nvolatility, we recommend owning HSCEI-SPX 70/110% corridor variance at 5 vol points,\na 3 vol point discount to vanilla variance spreads. Investors will be exposed to the\nrealized vol spread between HSCEI and SPX as long as HSCEI stays within 70-110% of\nits initial level. Pricing of corridor variance is cheaper than vanilla variance as investors\ncan avoid paying for the rich HSCEI convexity below the 70% barrier. The trade has a\npositive carry and benefits during China risk-off events.\nNote that the potential HSCEI index enhancement will reduce the financial weightings in\nHSCEI from 70% to 50% and lower realized volatility by 1.8 vol points. However, the\nenhancement will be implemented in stages. It will probably start in Dec-17 at the\nearliest and will not be fully implemented by the end of 2018, in our view.\nIndicative pricing (As of 19-Jun-17)\nBuy HSCEI-SPX Dec-18 70/110% corridor variance swap: 5 vol points\n16 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 20 June 2017\nChart 24: The HSCEI-SPX Dec-18 (18-month) variance swap spread is\nback to the lower-end of its 5-year trading range\n20%\n18%\n16%\n14%\n12%\n10%\n8%\n6%\n4%\n2%\n0%\nJan-12\nMay-12\nSep-12\nJan-13\nMay-13\nSep-13\nJan-14\nMay-14\nSep-14\nJan-15\nMay-15\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research Data as of 2-Jan-12 to 16-Jun-17\n18-month constant maturity variance swap spread is used as a proxy of Dec18 variance swap spread\nSep-15\nJan-16\nMay-16\nDec18 HSCEI SPX Variance Spread\nSep-16\nJan-17\nMay-17\nChart 25: The long term HSCEI-SPX realized vol spread has been higher\nthan the current implied corridor variance spread (5%) 98% of the time\nsince 2007\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n0%\nJul-07\nFeb-08\nSep-08\nApr-09\nNov-09\nJun-10\nJan-11\nAug-11\nMar-12\nOct-12\nMay-13\nDec-13\nJul-14\nFeb-15\nSep-15\nApr-16\nNov-16\nJun-17\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nHSCEI - SPX 18-month realized vol\nDec18 Variance Implied: 8%\nDec18 70/110% Corridor Variance Implied: 5%\nData as of 2-Jul-07 to 16-Jun-17\nChart 26: Historical payoff of buying HSCEI-SPX Dec-18 70/110%\ncorridor variance spread; higher payoffs during 2011-2012 and 2015\nsell-offs\n300,000\n250,000\n200,000\n150,000\n100,000\n50,000\n-\n-50,000\nJul-07\nJul-08\nJul-09\nJul-10\nJul-11\nJul-12\nJul-13\nJul-14\nJul-15\nJul-16\nTable 6: The HSCEI-SPX Dec-18 70/110% corridor variance trade\nhas a positive carry with realized vol across most tenors higher\nthan the current implied corridor variance swap spread\nHSCEI SPX Spread\n1M realized vol 12.1% 4.6% 7.5%\n3M realized vol 13.7% 6.8% 6.9%\n6M realized vol 14.0% 6.8% 7.2%\n12M realized vol 16.6% 9.7% 6.9%\n18M realized vol 20.8% 11.99% 8.8%\nHSCEI – SPX Dec18 70/110% corridor variance offer: 5.0%\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nHSCEI-SPX Dec18 70/110% corridor historical payoff (10k\nvega)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nData as of 2-Jul-07 to 16-Jun-17\nGlobal Equity Volatility Insights | 20 June 2017 17\nNotable trends and dislocations (Asia)\nMost regions in Asia reported modest declines last week, led by Hong Kong’s HSCEI,\nwhich lost 2.0% week-over-week. Much of the decline came on Thursday following the\nUS Fed’s decision to hike rates 25bps. Also in China, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC)\ninjected 410bn yuan (about $60bn) into the financial system via reverse-repos, the\nlargest cash boost since January. The central bank said the funds are meant to ease\nconcern amid a seasonal funding squeeze. The biggest contributors to the index’s loss\nwere financials names, including China Life Insurance (2628 HK), which fell 5.7%, Ping\nAn Insurance Group Co of China Ltd (2318 HK), which dropped 3.7%, Bank of China Ltd\n(3988 HK), which declined 1.8%, and China Merchants Bank Co Ltd (3968 HK), which fell\n5.7%. We saw a similar decline from Hong Kong’s HSI index, which lost 1.6% percent\nlast week.\nAfter the HSCEI and HSI, last week’s biggest losers were Korea’s KOSPI and India’s\nNIFTY, which each returned -0.8% week-over-week. In Japan, the Nikkei fell 0.3%. On\nFriday, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) left its monetary policy unchanged—it will continue to\ncontrol the yield curve via its negative benchmark rate and its asset purchasing program.\nThe final region to report a loss last week was Taiwan’s TWSE, which lost 0.4%.\nOn the other hand, the only region to see a gain last week was Australia, which saw its\nASX 200 benchmark increase 1.7% week-over-week. The biggest contributors to the\ngain were Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA AU), which gained 3.4%, Westpac\nBanking Corp (WBC AU), which increased 1.9%, and CSL Ltd (CSL AU), which added\n2.9%.\n10 day realized vol picked up in Asia last week, up 2.0 vol points to 9.6%\n• Asian 3m ATM volatility declined on average 0.1 vol point to 12.3% last week, while\n10 day realized vol increased on average 2.0 vol points to 9.6%. Notably, the HSI's\nrealized vol increased 5.4 vol points, the biggest increase in the region. On the\nother hand, the NKY was the only index to see a decline in 10 day realized vol—it\ndropped 4.3 vol points week-over-week to 7.2%.\n• On average, term structures among Asian indices steepened by 0.2 vol points to\n4.2% last week. The TWSE 12M-1M term structure steepened the most, increasing\n1.0 vol point to 2.9%. On the other hand, Hong Kong’s HSI saw the only flattening\nas its term structure flattened 0.1 vol point to 4.9%.\n• Asian 3M 90-110% skews widened 0.5 vol points on average to 3.8%. Taiwan’s\nTWSE widened the most, increasing 2.3 vol points to -0.2%.\nTable 7: Volatility measures of major Asian indices (data as of 16-Jun-17)\n3Mth ATM Implied Volatility 10D Realized Volatility 12Mth-1Mth ATM Vol Spread 3Mth 90-110 Skew Spread Equity Market\nWeekly 4Yr Weekly 4Yr Weekly 4Yr Weekly 4Yr Weekly\nCurrent change percentile Current change percentile Current change percentile Current change percentile return\nHSI 12.4% 0.2% 2.1% 10.2% 5.4% 20.6% 4.9% -0.1% 97.8% 3.3% 0.9% 41.4% -1.6%\nHSCEI 15.0% -0.4% 0.0% 10.7% 4.8% 7.8% 5.4% 0.2% 98.1% 1.4% 0.5% 36.5% -2.0%\nNKY 13.8% -0.2% 0.1% 7.2% -4.3% 1.8% 5.8% 0.5% 99.9% 5.8% 0.0% 73.9% -0.3%\nKOSPI 200 12.2% 0.2% 19.7% 11.1% 1.1% 53.1% 4.0% 0.2% 77.0% 3.8% 0.3% 43.7% -0.8%\nASX 200 11.8% -0.2% 17.7% 15.7% 5.1% 77.1% 2.7% 0.0% 59.5% 6.4% -0.1% 22.5% 1.7%\nNIFTY 10.7% 0.2% 2.2% 4.8% 1.0% 0.4% 4.0% 0.0% 76.1% 5.9% -0.1% 64.1% -0.8%\nTWSE 10.5% -0.6% 7.2% 7.8% 1.0% 20.3% 2.9% 1.0% 71.2% -0.2% 2.3% 3.9% -0.4%\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n18 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 20 June 2017\nChart 27: Both HSCEI and NKY term structures are near record steeps;\nwe favor calendar puts to hedge downside risks\n15%\n10%\n5%\n0%\n-5%\nJan-09\nJul-09\nJan-10\nJul-10\nJan-11\nJul-11\nJan-12\nJul-12\nNKY 3M-12M ATM Vol\nJan-13\nJul-13\nJan-14\nJul-14\nJan-15\nJul-15\nJan-16\nJul-16\nHSCEI 3M-12M ATM Vol\nJan-17\nCalendar puts are attractively priced given the steep term\nstructure\nWith the continuous low realized volatility environment, both\nNKY and HSCEI 3-month minus 12-month term structures\nsteepened to -3.7 vol points, which are near multi-year lows.\nAs our strategists think the Fed now appears concerned about\nsurging asset prices, investors should consider downside\nhedges.
