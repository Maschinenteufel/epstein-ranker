(Although the nature of the allegations will\ndramatically grow into threesomes and forced sexual encounters, nobody at this\npoint alleges anything more than Epstein masturbating. )\n\nEpstein vastly raises the stakes by calling Dershowitz, who flies into Palm\nBeach to put the local authorities in their place—alienating Palm Beach\nofficialdom—and, doubling down on the profile of the case, brings in Roy Black\nthe famous criminal attorney who defended William Kennedy Smith in his rape\ntrial in Palm Beach.\n\nHere’s the narrative: the shadowy rich man, friend of the louche and\ndisgraced President, at all times surrounded by a retinue of young and gorgeous\nfemale retainers doing his bidding, is now found to have gathered a network of\nwrong-side-of-the-tracks Palm Beach girls to provide him with weird sexual\nservices.

To boot,\nhis former girl friend, Ghislaine Maxwell—the daughter of the disgraced Robert\nMaxwell—encouraged at least one of the girls to come to Epstein’s home (and\nforever more has become a fixture of further weird possibilities in this tale).\n\nPalm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter is reported to say: “This is bigger\nthan Rush Limbaugh,” who, in a storm of publicity, has just been arrested in Palm\nBeach for possession of controlled drugs.\n\nOn one side are some of the nation’s most powerful defense attorneys (who,\nincreasingly, seem more stumblebum than effective), on the other side, a round-up\nof hapless girls, with sensational tales of perversion and infamy (in the telling they\nare not so much sex workers, as Dickensian victims), relatively speaking giving the\nPalm Beach authorities the choice between utter capitulation to the powerful or\nstanding on the side of the seemingly exploited and powerless.\n\nStill, with a cold eye, it also quite appears to be a straightforward tale of\nprostitution (however more or less kinky). And even though some of the girls are\nminors, age is not a distinguishing factor in a solicitation charge in Florida, (in\nNew York, for instance, at this time soliciting sex with anyone over the age of 14\nis a class D misdemeanor calling for a $100 fine—the law has recently been\nchanged to TK).\n\nIn fact, the very “SG” clearly tells the police that she lied about being 18\nbecause otherwise she knew she would not have been admitted to the house (other\ngirls will say they knew this is what they had to say, nevertheless not stopping\nthem from saying it).\n\nThe local sex crimes prosecutor, Lana Belhalevic, interviews all the girls and\ndetermines that the offense is solely related to prostitution—that there are “no real\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022858\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

She too was boring and rather stupid. She was called the\nqueen of mean, and I can only disclose incidents that occurred in public. Here’s one that shows\nhow she earned her title. We were having breakfast in the dining room of her hotel, when a\nwaiter brought me a cup of tea. She noticed, but I didn’t, that a little bit of the tea had dripped\nonto the saucer. It was certainly no big deal. When she saw it she grabbed the tea and the saucer\nand threw it on the floor in the direction of the waiter, shattering it into many pieces. She then\nscreamed at the waiter, “Now clean it up and beg me for your job.” I simply walked away, not\nwanting to be associated with that kind of public rudeness.\n\nWhen my daughter was born, Leona had her private jet fly a large stuffed bear to Boston, where it\nwas placed in a limo and brought to our home. My daughter loved the bear and several years\nlater had an opportunity to thank Leona for sending it. Leona replied: “It’s stolen merchandise. I\nstole it from Donald Trump.” She then explained how she had sold a hotel to Trump that\nincluded a pastry restaurant called Rumplemyers, which was decorated with large stuffed animals.\nThe sale included the stuffed animals, but Leona took the bear, which belonged to Trump, and\nsent it to my daughter. I told Leona that I would either have to return the stolen bear or get\nTrump’s permission to keep it. She said, “tell the Donald I stole it from him. See what he says.”\nI told Trump. He laughed and said “I’m not surprised. Let your daughter enjoy the bear.”\n\nOne day my brother, who was another of her lawyers, was invited to a birthday party at her\nhouse. He brought my mother along. Leona knew that my mother did not want to be confronted\nwith the reality that my brother is not kosher outside of his house. My brother, sensitive to this,\nalways eats only kosher food in her presence. He was on line with my mother at the buffet\nchoosing among the smoked salmon and vegetables when Leona came over to my mother and\nbrother and in her booming voice yelled, “In front of your mother you eat salmon. In front of me\nyou eat lobster. Ha ha ha.” It was entirely gratuitous, hurtful and all too typical.\n\nAlthough my brother and I—who were her appellate lawyers—saved Helmsley several years\nimprisonment by winning the state appeal—Helmsley refused to pay our final legal bill. We\nshould have demanded up front payment for all our services because she had a reputation for\n“negotiating” all of her bills. (“I'll give you 25 cents on the dollar. If you don’t like it, sue me!”’)\nMy brother eventually sued her but dropped the suit after she said she would spend “a large\nfortune beating him into the ground.”\n\nOnce when we were waiting to go to court, Leona told me a joke about two competitive Russian\nneighbors who hated each other. One day, the first one tripped over a lamp and a genie popped\nout. “You get the usual three wishes, but here’s the catch: everything you ask for and receive,\nyour neighbor gets double.” He asked for a thousand rubies, and the next day the neighbor\nboasted, “I got 2,000 rubies.” He asked for a beautiful woman, and the neighbor bragged he got\ntwo women. Finally, in frustrations he asked the genie, “Would it be too painful to cut off one of\nmy testicles?”\n\n396\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017483\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

That sanctioned regimes sometimes come to an end is not proof\nthat sanctions work, rather that they take a long time and usually require\nwar to \"work\".\n\nThis is a rarely researched topic because sanctions are diplomatic ideology\nrather than science. A debate in 1998 in International Security magazine\nsaw the Chicago academic, Robert Pape, barely challenged in his view\nthat only around five of the 115 cases of sanctions imposed since the war\ncould claim any plausible efficacy. Most merely inflicted \"significant\nhuman costs on the populations of target states, including on innocent\ncivilians who have little influence on their government's behaviour\". They\nare a ready invitation to war.\n\nWhen I was reporting on South Africa in the 1980s I became convinced\nthat sanctions were aiding import substitution and benefiting the Afrikaner\neconomy, probably giving apartheid an extra decade of life.

To the\ncontrary, even after the nonprosecution agreement had been signed, the\nOffice continued to tell the victims that the case was still “under\ninvestigation” and that they should be “patien[t].”*° When the victims\nlearned of the agreement, two of them (Jane Doe Number One and Jane\nDoe Number Two) filed suit in federal court under the Crime Victims’\nRights Act, arguing that the prosecutors had violated their CVRA right to\nconfer as well as their right to be treated fairly.*’ The victims contended\nthat prosecutors should have conferred with them about the nonprosecution\nagreement before it became final.\n\nIn response, the U.S. Attorney’s Office argued primarily that it was\nunder no obligation to extend the victims any rights under the CVRA. It\nwas the Government’s blunt position that “CVRA rights do not attach in the\nabsence of federal criminal charges filed by a federal prosecutor.”*8 In\nshort, the Government argued it was not required to confer in any way with\nthe victims, or even treat them fairly, because the CVRA was not yet in\nplay. The issue is thus squarely framed: Is the Government correct in its\nassertion that it has no CVRA obligations in cases like the Epstein case\nwhere federal prosecutors never lodged federal charges against a suspect?\nIn view of the CVRA’s prominence, resolution of this issue may shed\nimportant light on the nature of crime victims’ enactments and the breadth\nof the role that crime victims should have in the criminal justice process.\n\nII. THE CVRA’S APPLICATION BEFORE FORMAL CHARGES ARE FILED\n\nTo analyze the issue of whether the CVRA extends nghts to crime\nvictims before prosecutors have formally filed charges, it is useful to look at\nthe CVRA’s purposes, language, and judicial interpretations.

Maybe Begin would\nhave won anyway. But it was close, just one Knesset seat between the two\nmajor parties. And win, he did.\n\nI became increasingly convinced in the weeks that followed that Begin’s\nsecond government, with Arik now moved to defense minister, would further\nput the brakes on any follow-up negotiations for a deal with the Palestinians. I\ndid not yet know that Arik, in particular, had a far more ambitious, military plan\nto try to bury the possibility of a Palestinian state once and for all. But I did\nknow he had his eyes on a possible thrust across our northern border into\nLebanon, where Arafat and the PLO were based.\n\nThere was no public mention of any of this. But several times in 1981, I was\nordered to move a large part of my division onto the Golan Heights for weeks at\na time: two brigades, 200 tanks and dozens of APCs in a massive motorcade\nfrom the bottom to the top of the country and back again. We dubbed it\nCinerama, from the Hebrew words for Sinai and the Heights, Ramah. If there\nwas an escalation of hostilities, the northern command’s regular division would\ncross into Lebanon. Our role would be to take their place in defending the\nGolan, and possibly follow them in.\n\nWhen I returned from my final episode of Cinerama in the late summer of\n1981, the Sinai withdrawal was entering its final stage. I organized a full-scale\nmilitary exercise on the roughly one-third of the Egyptian desert we still held,\nknowing that we’d no longer have the room to do so after the final withdrawal.\nIt was the largest exercise I'd ever commanded. The advances and tactical\nretreats, the flanking maneuvers and ambushes and fighter jet attacks were like\na very big war in a very small place.\n\nBut a war game was not a real war. The Sinai was not like the Golan, or the\ncramped, hilly confines of Lebanon. And it was in Lebanon, the following year,\nthat the war came. It was different from any in Israel’s history. Arik was in\ncharge.

This issue seems to merit further mathematical investigation.\n\n7.3.4 Incorporating Computational Cost\n\nLet r44,g,7 be a probability distribution describing the amount of computational resources con-\nsumed by an agent 7 while achieving goal g over time-scale J. This is a probability distribution\nbecause we want to account for the possibility of nondeterministic agents. 50, 77,..97r(Q) tells\nthe probability that @ units of resources are consumed. For simplicity we amalgamate space\nand time resources, energetic resources, etc. into a single number Q, which is assumed to live\nin some subset of the positive reals. Space resources of course have to do with the size of the\nsystem’s memory. Then we may define\n\nDefinition 6 The efficient pragmatic general intelligence of an agent x with resource\nconsumption Nru,9,7, relative to the distribution v over environments and the distribution +\nover goals, is its expected performance with respect to goals drawn from y in environments drawn\nfrom v, over the time-scales natural to the goals, normalized by the amount of computational\neffort expended to achieve each goal; that is,\n\n_ YL) Y(G, Le w9,T(@) ya\nTrg) = » ail Q mst Viig.T\nHEB,GEG,Q,T\n\n(in those cases where this sum is convergent).\n\nThis is a measure that rates an agent’s intelligence higher if it uses fewer computational\nresources to do its business. Roughly, it measures reward achieved per spacetime computation\nunit.\n\nNote that, by abandoning the universal prior, we have also abandoned the proof of conver-\ngence that comes with it. In general the sums in the above definitions need not converge; and\nexploration of the conditions under which they do converge is a complex matter.\n\n7.3.5 Assessing the Intelligence of Real-World Agents\n\nThe pragmatic and efficient pragmatic general intelligence measures are more “realistic” than\nthe Legg and Hutter universal intelligence measure, in that they take into account the innate\nbiasing and computational resource restrictions that characterize real-world intelligence. But as\ndiscussed earlier, they still live in “fantasy-land” to an extent — they gauge the intelligence of an\nagent via a weighted average over a wide variety of goals and environments; and they presume\na simplistic relationship between agents and rewards that does not reflect the complexities\nof real-world cognitive architectures. It is not obvious from the foregoing how to apply these\nmeasures to real-world intelligent systems, which lack the ability to exist in such a wide variety\nof environments within their often brief lifespans, and mostly go about their lives doing things\nother than pursuing quantified external rewards. In this brief section we describe an approach\nto bridging this gap.

In the early decades the industry evolved along multiple\nlines but eventually settled into an integrated, fully-regulated model, deemed appropriate as utilities\nwere considered to have monopoly power. During the era of full regulation, utility stocks were often\ncharacterized as low-risk “widow and orphan” stocks in the US, and large parts of the global utility\nindustry remained government-owned. During these early days, long/short investing could not have\nexisted at scale, as the ability to find and generate short alpha would have been difficult given the sector’s\ngovernment ownership and bond-like nature of returns.\n\nIn the 1980s, Lord David Howell (formerly UK Secretary of State for Energy in the Thatcher government)\nadvocated having then-fully regulated power plants compete to sell their production into a competitive\npower market (a “power pool”) where the price of electricity would be set at the intersection of supply\n(power plants) and demand (industrial users and electricity supply companies selling to households). This\nled to the world’s first competitive power pools being rolled out in the UK in the early 1990s. While\nbased in Asia, Jos Shaver led UBS’ Asian utility industry group and had the privilege of working with Lord\nHowell when UBS acted as advisor to the State Power Corporation of China on the restructuring of that\ncountry’s national power industry.\n\nCompetitive power pools have since sprung up all over the world, and regulators have pulled apart\npreviously fully-integrated utilities in the name of efficiency and maximizing competition. In addition,\ngovernments around the world have begun to privatize their state utility industries and organize bespoke\ncompetitive market structures that best meet their needs. These changes have resulted in a hybrid\nmodern industry which continues to evolve.\n\nThe deregulatory impulse has brought tremendous benefits to national economies, driving down costs\nand improving efficiency and system reliability, but has also produced unintended consequences, e.g., the\nhigh-profile bankruptcies of Enron, British Energy, Dynegy, NRG, PG&E and others. As such, although one\ncan still find low-beta, low-volatility defensive stocks, the global utility sector has not been for “widow\nand orphan” investors for quite some time due to structural changes in an evolving industry that\ncontinue to alter the investment landscape.\n\nIt is important to note that the modern utility industry is still in its infancy, having begun in the early\n1990s, and its continued evolution — structural change — will provide ample long/short opportunities for\nthe foreseeable future. Structural change catalysts are driven by: i) a utility’s various stakeholders,\nincluding governments, managements, consumers, et al. which seek to mold the utility to their needs and\nobjectives, or ii) variables outside of stakeholder control such as commodity prices and new technologies.\nA specialist approach to the global utility sector is essential as each country’s market structure (and often\nthat of regions within countries) can be very different as a result of the varying levels of competition,\nmarket concentration, geographic constraints, infrastructure bottlenecks, regulatory constructs, fuel\nsupply availability and so on.\n\n25 Electron Capital Partners, LLC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024226\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In terms of how to do programming,\nit’s an interesting question. Take nanotechnology. How did we achieve nanotechnology?\nAnswer: We took technology as we understand it on a large scale and we made it very\nsmall. How to make a CPU chip on the atomic scale? Fundamentally, we use the same\narchitecture as the CPU chip we know and love. That isn’t the only approach one can\ntake. Looking at what simple programs can do suggests that you can take even simple\nimpoverished components and with the right compiler you can make them do interesting\nthings. We don’t do molecular-scale computing yet, because the ambient technology is\nsuch that you’d have to spend a decade building it. But we’ve got the components that\nare enough to make a universal computer. You might not know how to program with\nthose components, but by doing searches in the space of possible programs, you'd start to\namass building blocks, and you could then create a compiler for them. The surprising\nthing is that impoverished stuff is capable of doing sophisticated things, and the\ncompilation step is not as gruesome as you might expect.\n\nJust searching the computational universe and trying to find programs—building\nblocks—that are interesting is a good approach. A more traditional engineering\napproach—trying by pure thought to figure out how to build a universal computer—is a\nharder row to hoe. That doesn’t mean it can’t be done, but my guess is that we’ll be able\nto do some amazing things just by finding the components and searching the possible\nprograms we can make with them. Then it’s back to the question about connecting\nhuman purposes to what is available from the system.\n\nOne question I’m interested in is, What will the world look like when most people\ncan write code? We had a transition, maybe five hundred years ago or so, when only\nscribes and a small set of the population could read and write natural language. Today, a\nsmall fraction of the population can write code. Most of the code they write is for\ncomputers only. You don’t understand things by reading code. But there will come a\ntime when, as a result of things I’ve tried to do, the code is at a high enough level that it’s\na minimal description of what you’re trying to do. It will be a piece of code that’s\nunderstandable to humans but also executable by the machines.\n\nCoding is a form of expression, just as writing in a natural language is a form of\nexpression. To me, some simple pieces of code are poetic—they express ideas in a very\nclean way. There’s an aesthetic aspect, much as there is to expression in a natural\nlanguage. One feature of code is that it’s immediately executable; it’s not like writing.\nWhen you write something, somebody has to read it, and the brain that’s reading it has to\nabsorb the thoughts that came from the person who did the writing. Look at how\nknowledge has been transmitted in the history of the world. At level zero, one form of\nknowledge transmission is essentially genetic—that is, there’s an organism, and its\nprogeny has the same features that it had. Then there’s the kind of knowledge\ntransmission that happens with things like physiological recognition. A newborn creature\nhas some neural network with some random connections in it, and as the creature moves\naround in the world, it starts recognizing kinds of objects and it learns that knowledge.\n\nThen there’s the level that was the big achievement of our species, which is\nnatural language. The ability to represent knowledge abstractly enough that we can\ncommunicate it brain to brain, so to speak. Arguably, natural language is our species’\nmost important invention. It’s what led, in many respects, to our civilization.\n\n189\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016992\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Brooke was paid\n$450 for the photo sessions by Playboy Press, and her mother signed a release giving the\nphotographer the unlimited right to publish the photographs anywhere and at any time.\n\nSeven years later, as Brooke was about the enter Princeton as a freshman, the photographer\ndecided to exploit her fame by producing a calendar featuring naked pictures of the 10 year old.\nBrooke was upset that any such calendar would circulate among her fellow students at Princeton\nand would cause her great embarrassment.\n\nShe hired a former student of mine to try to negotiate with the photographer to buy back the\nrights, and if that failed, to try to prevent publication of the photographs. My former student\nsought my advice on the matter. I told him it would be an uphill fight to try to enjoin the\npublication of the pictures, because they were not obscene and because prior restraint is always\ndisfavored by the law.\n\nThis was another example, this time of a celebrity mother, making a short term judgment to allow\nher young daughter to pose naked, without considering the longer term implications on her\nwelfare. The only theory on which I thought she could possibly succeed was that Brooke’s\nmother had no right to surrender her daughter’s privacy and that Brooke, now approaching\nadulthood, should have control over her own image.\n\nUltimately the court ruled, in a bizarre opinion, that Brooke had essentially waived her right to\nprivacy by allowing the photographs to be published earlier, and by pursuing a career in which she\nhas relied on her sexuality for her success. The court put it this way:\n\n“Much of plaintiff's recent commercial activity upon which her fame is based has been far\nmore sexually suggestive than the photographs which have been shown to the court.\nThese photographs are not sexually suggestive, provocative or pornographic; they do not\nsuggest promiscuity. They are photos of a prepubescent girl in innocent poses at her bath.\nIn contrast, defense counsel have submitted numerous samples of sex-oriented publicity\nconcerning plaintiff. Particularly notable is her widely televised sexually suggestive\nadvertisement for blue jeans. Recent film appearances have been sexually provocative\n(e.g., “The Blue Lagoon”, “Endless Love”.). Plaintiffs claim of harm is thus undermined\nto a substantial extent by the development of her career projecting a sexually provocative\nimage.\n\nThis reasoning fails to distinguish between a 17 year old and a 10 year old. The earlier\nphotographs were taken of a 10 year old kid, whose mother controlled what she would do. Her\nrecent appearances were made by a near-adult and were far more within her own control. The\ncourt simply ignored the argument by the 10 year old should not be bound by foolish decisions\nmade by an ambitious mother when Brooke was too young to say no.\n\n367\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017454\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It has refused to\nlift the Mubarak-era “emergency law” allowing arrests without trial,\nand it has sent as many as 12,000 civilians to military trials.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031945\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I am currently on a plane until noon pacific time, and \nthen heading to a meeting right after landing, till about 2 pm or so. While I am running the risk that you will \nreport my comments, if you do, either out of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be \ncomplete, as I always try and do with reporters. If you decide to go ahead with a story, which, after reading \nmy responses, I hope you decide is inappropriate, I would like you to quote my responses fully in order not to \ndistort them. \nIt is hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading \nstatements. I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard to support and mentor students, \ncolleagues, and members of the general public, and this is supported by the institutions of which I am a part. I \ndo not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your reporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other \ninstitutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the \nopposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031434 \nme up to a host of unfounded outside complaints and allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of \nwhich the University has to respond to. The fact that I have remained a professor in all Universities with \nwhich I have been associated, in good standing, and also an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like \nCFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that their experience validates a trust in \nmy behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and continue to be invited to their last 3 meetings \nto speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my \ntalks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to \nimpugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your \n'miscellaneous facts', as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than \nallegations and innuendo by people whose motives I cannot judge. I also try and judge the facts in \ncontext. The fact that Universities and other organizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me \nto meetings is because they value my contributions and my actions. \nThe items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 \nwhere we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, \nand there were respectful and platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which \ninvolves an anonymous 3rd party claim because I know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it \nclearly was not taken seriously enough to result in any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying \nthat because I decided I didn't want to go out to a bar with a group of attendees that I was harassing them? The \nsecond part did not happen. Re incident 5: The 'female companion' in this case is my wife, who accompanied \nme on the cruise, and has attested to the fact that the claim is false. This is what I wrote at the time in response \nto the blog in question, causing it to be taken down. \nIt is worth responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail, \nRe item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came \nto me, asked me to talk over coffee, or wrote to me with questions. When she asked about advice for after \ngraduation I DID tell her she was different than the other students in her year. The rest of them were interested \nin going on to graduate school in physics, but she was interested in science communication so I told her that \nshe might want to take a different path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as I recall, I did ask her on \none of these occasions if that made it difficult for her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member and \ndepartment chair I was interested in knowing what we could do, if necessary to encourage more women to go \ninto physics, and also because as someone she had asked for career advice from I wanted to know if that made \na difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have gone back over emails from that period. I have numerous \nrequests from her asking me to go for coffee to talk, which I usually had to turn down because I was busy, and \non several occasions she asked me to have coffee with her off campus to talk, and I politely declined. I did let \nher accompany me off campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it, \nand I believe she found it useful. I did and do have coffee and meals with students on campus, and I see \nnothing wrong with this. I try to treat students as respected colleagues if possible. I was shocked when I later \nlearned of the complaint she was apparently asked to lodge to the University, not least because there was no \ninappropriate interaction but also because, well after the dates you listed on which she was apparently \noffended, she continued to email me with joking questions or comments. Also, at a later AAAS \nconference, again in 2008, for which she had asked, and for which I had written her a letter of \nrecommendation to attend, my wife and I gave her a lift in our taxi well out out of our way in order to drop her \noff at her hotel, and I note in an email response to her email about the conference, again in 2008, I expressed \nthat I would pass her regards along to my wife and vice versa. When the University later informed me of the \ncomplaint I was shocked and concerned. When I spoke to the human resources person, including relating my \nconcerns and explaining the situation, I was told that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was \nrequested. By that time I learned of the complaint I had already announced my intentions to leave Case to \naccept an offer at ASU—a very difficult decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the \nUniversity, the excellent relations I had with my colleagues there— both among the faculty (many of whom in \nphysics I had hired while department chair)) and among the administration, along with a very attractive \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031435 \ncounter-offer by Case. Because I was already in Arizona at the later time I was asked not to have any further \ninteraction with the student I agreed to that request, both to respect her sensitivities and also because it was \nbasically moot because I was not on campus. Following this episode, as indicated in the letter to the student, I \ndid assess what might have led to misinterpretations by this student, and became more careful in offering \nadvice when talking to students. I was also told by human resources that because it was decided to handle this \ninformally and not formally, that (a) it should remain confidential, which I, at least abided by, and (b) if no \nfurther complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would preserve its confidentiality and remove \nthe complaint from my record after 5 years, which makes me surprised and concerned that someone violated \nthat written agreement with you. \nRe item 6: You report on ASU's response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University \nspecifically stated there were never any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the \nUniversity, and moreover that the 'outside complaints' were in fact related specifically to your item \n#6. Further you neglect to mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual \nwho was allegedly harassed, who never lodged a complaint, and that no specific evidence was provided of the \nalleged transgression. I was surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the \nbasis of this but was told by both Universities that because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third \nparty complaints at private events unrelated to the University would be investigated. The complaint was \ninvestigated by both ASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion that it was not credible and no university \npolicies had been violated. In addition ANU's investigation, which took a full month, found various \ninconsistencies in the allegation, which suggest distortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU \nreport. The initial complaint, which in fact resulted in a temporary suspension of my position at ANU until it \nwas dismissed, outlined the claim you made in the words you quoted in your note to me, but it also stated \n\"It is the University's understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the \ntime of the incident.\" \nAfter the month-long investigation, during which I was told I was not to interact with anyone on campus (again \nmoot because I was a hemisphere removed) the final report, from which I quote below absolved me of any \nwrongdoing, reinstating my position, and indicated information inconsistent with the original claim and \napparent later claims: \n\"The allegations were made by an observer to the incident. \n- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly \ntouched in \nan unwelcome manner. \n- The conference attendee who took the `selfie' photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference \norganisers \nat the time of the incident (November 2016). \n- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference \norganisers \nat the time of the incident (November 2016). \n-The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact. \n- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who \ntook \nthe `selfie' photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was \nrequested \nin the course of the investigation.\" \n(And for the record I often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as I specifically request \nselfies not to include flashes, so that I don't end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next \nhalf hour. Moreover, I have no idea if the other eyewitnesses you quote, who were not involved in any \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031436 \ncomplaint, were in fact there but this was a formal banquet with individuals and their partners, which I \nattended long enough to agree to sign things and do selfies before leaving early because I was tired. Even if I \nhad any such intent it would have been lunacy to pose for selfies in front of a group and openly do such a \nthing, including presumably in front of this person's partner, . Which, besides the fact that I don't do such \nthings, is one of the many reasons it never happened.) \nWhat makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that I get asked for literally thousands of selfies, \nand when people come up to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, or sometimes aggressive. I am particularly \nproud of the way I work to make all people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated, whatever their \nbehavior or request. Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what I am about, which characterizes all my \ninteractions with fans: to acknowledge them in a way that makes them feel appreciated and respected. As I \nunderstand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take selfies at the CFI conference in Las Vegas this \nyear, that behavior is what they will have witnessed and should report on. Moreover, I am proud of the \ninteractions I have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff of all genders and \nethnicities. I have worked hard to support them, mentor them, and treat them with respect. I treat others as \nresponsible adults, and I expect to be treated equally. \nOn Dec 10, 2017, at 6:12 PM, Peter Aldhous \nDr. Krauss: \nwrote: \nAs you know, I'm a reporter for BuzzFeed News who has been investigating sexual misconduct allegations \nagainst you. As we've already discussed by email, I'd very much like to interview you about these allegations \nin detail. \nIn particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two universities had investigated an incident (# 6 \nbelow). You claimed that \"both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and \nfabricated with malicious intent.\" We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious \nintent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it. \nThe story concerns your actions towards students while a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve \nUniversity, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement. \nI am reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, Azeen Ghorayshi and Virginia \nHughes. \nOur story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below). \nOur reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with — Case Western, \nArizona State University, the Australian National University, the New College of the Humanities, and the \nCenter for Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors — have handled \ncomplaints and concerns about your behavior during this time. \nOur story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and \neyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues, \nstudents, and peers in the skeptics movement. \nI wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you \nwish to comment on any of the below findings, we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We are \nplanning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, Eastern US Time. \nBased on our reporting, this is what we plan to publish: \nIncident 1: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031437 \n• In November of 2006, at an event launching the new Center for Inquiry in Washington D.C., you met a \nvolunteer for CFI D.C. \n• At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked \nher if she was \"of age.\" \n• Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner. \n• You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying. \n• You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work. \n• In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne, \ndespite her suggestion that you go down to dinner. \n• You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face. \n• You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and \ntrying to pull down the crotch of her tights. \n• She struggled to push you off her. \n• You said, \"When I was in college I could never get a girl that looked like you.\" \n• When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said \"I have to go,\" and rushed out of \nthe room. \nIncident 2: \n• In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve \nUniversity, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it \nmust be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates. \n• In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student \nvisited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored \nthe questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner. \n• Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without \nmentioning you by name. \"There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought \ndifferently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me \nupset for weeks afterward,\" she wrote. \n• She was then approached by a dean at the university, who suspected that she was referring to you, \nbased on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and \nshe did. \n• University investigators interviewed both you and the student. \n• On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university's associate vice president for student \naffairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told: \n\"This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university's sexual harassment \npolicy. \n• The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she \nremained at Case. \n11 \n• The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics \ndepartment before setting foot on the campus again. \n• The letter also stated, \"Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also \nhis willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with \nstudents.\" \n• By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the \nmonth before. \n• \"The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career,\" \nyou told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031438 \nIncident 3: \n• A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous \nincident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her. \nIncident 4: \n• You met a student from another university, an atheist activist, in March 2008 at the American Atheists \nConvention in Minneapolis. She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she \nwas attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic. \n• During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student \nand volunteers for Dawkins' foundation. \n• Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink. \n• You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a \nmale friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go. \n• You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, Iowa, in April 2011. \n• You pulled over a chair for her in the bar, and then started running your hand up her leg under the \ntable. \n• She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She \ncrossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away. \nIncident 5: \n• This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were \ninformed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your \nfemale companion for sex in your cabin. \n• At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged \nCFI's president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galapagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise, \nhowever. \nIncident 6: \n• During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once \nagain. \n• The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics  \nNational Convention, where you were a featured speaker. \n• With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie. \n• As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her \nright breast. \n• She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. \"Don't do that,\" she said. \n• BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College \nof the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your \nhand in motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest.

After hearing more about your \nreputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016 \nincident. \n• On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National \nUniversity in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting \nappointments. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031439 \n• Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But \nneither university found against you. \n• \"Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate \nthe allegations,\" Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her. \n• Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State's Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an \ninquiry \"did not find a violation of university policy.\" \n• In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints \nof sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university's senior associate general \ncounsel, noted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. \"The \nUniversity did not find either communication to state a credible allegation,\" Jewett wrote. \nMiscellaneous facts: \n• In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort \nto understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since. \n• Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent \nessays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made \nwith biologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America's leading public \nintellectuals. \n• You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and are a \nvocal critic of President Donald Trump. \n• \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

The Justice Department has\npromulgated the Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness\nAssistance, the latest edition of which is from May 2012. The Guidelines\ndiscuss crime victims’ rights under both the CVRA and the earlier VRRA.\nBecause of the OLC memorandum discussed above, the Guidelines limit\nCVRA rights until after the time “when criminal proceedings are initiated\nby complaint, information, or indictment.”?°? The Department, however,\nprovides hortatory guidance that Justice Department employees shall make\n“best efforts” to notify crime victims about their CVRA rights “as early in\nthe criminal justice process as is feasible and appropriate.””°?\n\nOf greater interest, however, is the Department’s mandatory policy\nregarding notification regarding crime victim services under the VRRA.\nThe Guidelines explain how “Department responsibilities to crime victims\nbegin as soon as possible after the detection of a crime at which they may\nbe undertaken without interfering in the investigation.”°* The Guidelines\nthen direct the appropriate “responsible official” to provide crime victims\nwith “information about services available to them.”?° This information\nmust be provided at “the earliest opportunity after detection of a crime at\nwhich it may be done without interfering with an investigation.”?°°\n\nThe Department appears to have little difficulty implementing this\nrequirement. Evidence of this fact comes from the Justice Department\nitself, which responded to the letter from Senator Kyl discussed earlier\nquestioning why the Department was not applying the CVRA before\ncharges were filed.*°’ In its response, the Department noted that OLC had\nissued an opinion that the CVRA did not extend rights before the formal\nfiling of charges.*°* “Even so,” the Department explained, “the new AG\nGuidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make\n\n201 597 F.3d 391 (5th Cir. 2008).\n\n202 ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES, supra note 52, at 8.\n\n203 Td. at 35.\n\n204 Td. at 26 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 10607(b) (2006)).\n\n205 Td. at 29 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 10607(b)(2)).

I was still barely 18 months into the\nrole, and anxious to get further command experience. But just as I was feeling at\nmy weakest, there was another belated casualty from the 1973 war. This time, it\nwas Uzi Yairi. No one could reasonably have held him responsible for the\nlosses suffered by Battalion 890 at the Chinese Farm. I’m sure that if he’d\nknown what happened to the Israeli forces that had already tried to take it over,\nhe would never have allowed Yitzhik to go in without adequate armor and\nartillery support. Still, he blamed himself. In obvious distress after the war, he\nwas reassigned as an operational officer in military intelligence in the kirya.\n\nHe was still at his desk when Fatah terrorists landed on Tel Aviv’s seafront a\nlittle before midnight on March 4, 1975. They were spotted by a police patrol,\nwhich opened fire. The Fatah men ran from the beach, firing Kalashnikovs and\ntossing grenades. A block in from the sea, they burst into a modest, three-story\nbuilding: the old Savoy Hotel. They shot and killed three people in the lobby\nand took the rest of the staff and guests hostage.\n\nSayeret Matkal was called in. As the unit went through final preparations for\ntheir assault, Uzi showed up. He had a rifle. He was in his everyday officer’s\nuniform, unlike the sayeret team, which was weighted down by special-forces\ngear. As a former commander of the sayeret, he persuaded them he could help\ntake out the terrorists and locate the hostages. Shortly before dawn, led by\nAmiram Levin, they attacked. They killed three of the Fatah men within\nseconds. But another terrorist set off an explosion, collapsing most of the top\nfloor. Uzi joined a couple of the other sayeret men in search of the hostages. He\nwas shot in the head and neck. Seven of the eight terrorists were killed, the\nother captured. Though five hostages were freed, five lost their lives. Uzi died\non the operating table of Ichilov Hospital, a few hundred yards from the kirya.\n\nThough I doubt Uzi’s family and friends would agree, my gut feeling was\nalways that his death was one more result, however indirect, of the shambolic\nway in which we’d organized our attacks on the Chinese Farm.

Under her gaze, plates of finger sandwiches are delivered to Epstein and guests by the\nmenservants in white gloves.\n\nUpstairs, to the right of a spiral staircase, is the “office,” an enormous gallery spanning the width\nof the house. Strangely, it holds no computer. Computers belong in the “computer room” (a\nsmaller room at the back of the house), Epstein has been known to say. The office features a\ngilded desk (which Epstein tells people belonged to banker J. P. Morgan), 18th-century black\nlacquered Portuguese cabinets, and a nine-foot ebony Steinway “D” grand. On the desk, a\npaperback copy of the Marquis de Sade’s Zhe Misfortunes of Virtue was recently spotted.\nCovering the floor, Epstein has explained, “is the largest Persian rug you’ll ever see in a private\nhome—so big, it must have come from a mosque.” Amid such splendor, much of which reflects\nthe work of the French decorator Alberto Pinto, who has worked for Jacques Chirac and the\nroyal families of Jordan and Saudi Arabia, there is one particularly startling oddity: a stuffed\nblack poodle, standing atop the grand piano. “No decorator would ever tell you to do that,”\nEpstein brags to visitors. “But I want people to think what it means to stuff a dog.” People can’t\nhelp but feel it’s Epstein’s way of saying that he always has the last word.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn addition to the town house, Epstein lives in what is reputed to be the largest private dwelling\nin New Mexico, on an $18 million, 7,500-acre ranch which he named “Zorro.” “It makes the\ntown house look like a shack,” Epstein has said. He also owns Little St. James, a 70-acre island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, where the main house is currently being renovated by Edward Tuttle,\na designer of the Amanresorts. There is also a $6.8 million house in Palm Beach, Florida, and a\nfleet of aircraft: a Gulfstream IV, a helicopter, and a Boeing 727, replete with trading room, on\nwhich Epstein recently flew President Clinton, actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey,\nsupermarket magnate Ron Burkle, Lew Wasserman’s grandson, Casey Wasserman, and a few\nothers, on a mission to explore the problems of AIDS and economic development in Africa.\n\nEpstein is charming, but he doesn’t let the charm slip into his eyes. They are steely and\ncalculating, giving some hint at the steady whir of machinery running behind them. “Let’s play\nchess,” he said to me, after refusing to give an interview for this article. “You be white. You get\nthe first move.” It was an appropriate metaphor for a man who seems to feel he can win no\nmatter what the advantage of the other side. His advantage is that no one really seems to know\nhim or his history completely or what his arsenal actually consists of. He has carefully\nengineered it so that he remains one of the few truly baffling mysteries among New York’s\nmoneyed world. People know snippets, but few know the whole.\n\n“He’s very enigmatic,” says Rosa Monckton, the former C.E.O. of Tiffany & Co. in the U.K. and\na close friend since the early 1980s. “You think you know him and then you peel off another ring\nof the onion skin and there’s something else extraordinary underneath.

It takes no courage for me to\nexercise my academic freedom, since I have tenure. But if I were an untenured assistant\nprofessor, would I have the courage to risk the wrath of the P.C. cops? Are other, less\nestablished, teachers being coerced into changing their teaching by the fear of negative\nevaluations, which can be fatal to tenure? You bet they are, and it poses a real danger to\nacademic freedom and good education. One criminal law professor told me that he searches for\ncasebooks that don’t cover rape: “If it’s covered in the book and I skip it, I get criticized. And if\nI discuss it, I get criticized. This way I can blame it on the book.” Talk about lack of courage!\n\nI told the students who threatened to charge me with sexual harassment to go ahead and make my\nday. I would love to defend against such a charge, by demonstrating their misuse of the serious\nmoral crime of real sexual harassment. I have represented women who have experienced real\nsexual harassment—including a graduate student who was explicitly told by her faculty advisor\nthat the quality of her recommendation would depend on whether she slept with him—and I\nunderstand the enormous pain it can cause. In that case of quid pro quo sexual harassment, there\nwas no grey area. The professor was as clear as could be. The student told me that she had really\nthought the professor liked her because of the excellent work she had done for him. Now she\nwasn’t sure. She was devastated. Her self confidence was shattered. She wanted justice. She\nalso wanted to make sure that her career as an academic would not be hurt by her refusal to “go\nalong” with the offer of a good recommendation. That was real sexual harassment! Listening to\nviews about rape that are different from your own isn’t sexual harassment. It’s called education.\n\nI advised the sexually harassed student to file a complaint and bring a lawsuit. She agreed. I\nexplained to her what a complaint would entail. She said she understood and was prepared to\nendure depositions, cross examinations, and other attacks on her. The next day she came to my\noffice and told me she couldn’t go through with it. She was terrified that it would destroy her\nprospects for an academic appointment to take on so influential and powerful an academic. She\nwas also afraid that if she did nothing, he would carry out his threat to write her a bad\nrecommendation.\n\nI suggested that she talk to the professor and tell him that she had consulted me but had decided\nnot to fill a complaint or lawsuit and that she hoped that he would give her the recommendation\nshe deserved. She did that and eventually received a superb recommendation. She is now\nteaching at a fine university. So is he.\n\nThe students in my class never followed through on their threat.\n\nSome women do lie\n\nI continue to challenge the students by teaching both about cases in which guilty rapist are\nwrongly acquitted, and cases in which innocent people have been falsely accused of rape. I teach\nthat when it comes to the serious crime of rape, it appears that both men and women lie,\nexaggerate, or misremember more often than with other, less emotionally charged, crimes.

The people awarding the grades often have\na vested interest in those grades improving. Even a tiny positive bias in\nthe most scrupulously honest teacher is enough for grades to creep up.\nHowever, grade inflation might not be purely a matter of over enthusiastic\nteachers. IQ scores are also rising. Welcome to the Flynn Effect.\n\nJames Flynn, Emeritus Professor of Political Studies at the\nUniversity of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, reported in 1987 that\n1Q scores rise over time throughout the world. All told the population\ngains about one IQ point every three years, and approximately every\nten years IQ tests have to be re-calibrated, so the average student once\nagain receives the average grade. This is a mystery. It is a large effect and\ncannot be explained by the rote learning of lots of sample questions. The\nhuman race is either rapidly getting smarter or the least smart members\nof society are coming up to the general average fast; either way it means\nthere are fewer dumb people around. The Flynn Effect has recently\nslowed in western countries, suggesting it might be that intelligence is\nconverging rather than increasing overall. Another interesting fact is\npeople become more intelligent as they age, gaining about one IQ point\nevery ten years. Against the stereotype, it’s not all downhill after forty.\nThere is hope for me yet!\n\nUntil recently we thought IQ was fixed, but new research contradicts\nthis. Muscles get stronger with exercise, physical skills, such as playing\ngolf and tennis, improve with practice; why not intelligence? Scientists\nused to believe brains couldn't get smarter; you had the IQ you were\nborn with. You might learn more ‘stuff’ during your life, but the G factor\nstayed the same. It looks like this is wrong and we were simply not using\nthe right exercises.\n\nIn 2008, Susanne Jaeggi and Martin Buschkuehl, of the University\nof Maryland, modified an intelligence test into a game and showed\nplaying the game improved ‘fluid’ intelligence and increases IQ. They\nbelieve playing their game helps improve working memory -— the short-\nterm memory we use for storing sums as we do mental arithmetic —\nor remembering telephone numbers. Previous attempts to improve\n1Q through practice had not shown much success as the skills did not\ntransfer between tests, but working memory is such a useful thing it\nappears to help across the board.\n\nThese factors argue against intelligence being a hardware feature of\nour brain. It does not remain static but instead improves with age, time,\nand education.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015723\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Disentangling the details would take months.\nBut we already knew the human cost of those failures. Hundreds of Israeli\nsoldiers had been killed.

Some of the dead in other units were close\nfriends.\n\nI felt exhausted. I also realized that Nava, thousands of miles away in Palo\nAlto, and my parents on the kibbutz could still not be sure I had escaped the fate\nof so many others. I learned later that my parents had been making daily calls to\nDigli, who was working in intelligence in the kirya. Though he had no way of\nknowing where I was, he kept assuring them that he had checked with my\ncommanders and that I was alive and well. Nava had been relying on American\nnews reports and the relayed assurances from my parents, which she was\nseasoned enough as an army wife to treat with skepticism.\n\nI missed her badly, and little Michal. I felt the need to hear their voices. I\ndrove to one of the brigade communications units. There was a long line in front\nof the radio telephone. But within a half-hour, I managed to get a crackly\nconnection to California. Nava burst into tears when she heard my voice. I told\nher I was fine, and that I couldn’t wait to see her and our little girl. Then, my\nown eyes dampening, I reeled off the names of friends who had died. In\naddition to the brave men I’d lost in my own battalion, there were more than a\ndozen others I already knew of. A pair of brothers from Mishmar Hasharon, a\ncouple of years younger than me, in separate units, but killed within hours of\neach other. Another childhood friend, from a nearby moshav, named Rafi\nMitzafon. And Shaul Shalev, a gifted philosophy postgraduate and a brave tank\ncommander whom I’d become friends with at officers’ school.

A carbon tax would target the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouses gases in the burning of \ngasoline, coal and other fossil fuels. \nThe study of the new options — which would represent major changes to American economic policy — comes as the \nadministration looks to tax reform as its next major battleground for implementing its agenda. Trump wants to cut \ntaxes sharply, but his advisers are looking for ways to raise revenue so as not to create a giant hole in the deficit. \nAdministration officials stressed that no final decision has been made and they are reviewing different alternatives. \nTwo officials and a third person confirmed the consideration of the value-added tax, while one official and the third \nperson confirmed the consideration of the carbon tax. \nThe search for new options reflects a recognition of the political challenges facing a proposal known as a border-\nadjustment tax that the White House and some Republicans had begun to rally around. The proposal, effectively a tax \non imports, would not only raise needed revenue but also serve to fulfill Trump's pledge to protect American \ncompanies from unfair export competition. \nThe tax would create incentives for companies to manufacture and produce goods domestically. But the proposal is \nunpopular with many other Republicans, who have said it would raise costs for consumers on things such as \nautomobiles, electronics and clothing. \nA value-added tax and a carbon tax have long been favored tools among economists, including some on the right, to \nraise revenue in a way that supports economic growth. But the prospect of any new taxes has long drawn skepticism \nfrom Republicans. \nAmanda Ens \nDirector \nBank of America Merrill Lynch \nMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated \nOne Bryant Park, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10036 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014858 \n<!--[if !vmI]--> \nBank of America \nMerrill Lynch \nAwards Equity denvatives \nhouse of the year \n<![endif]--> \nThis message, and any attachments, is for the intended recipient(s) only, may contain information that is privileged, confidential and/or \nproprietary and subject to important terms and conditions available at http://www.bankofamerica.com/emaildisclaimer.

The \"rules\" of groupie sex are well known to both groupies and athletes.\nThe groupies want sex with superstars in exchange for bragging rights that they slept with the\n\"high-scorer,\" the \"champ\" or the \"star.\" Some, like Washington, hope that the star will fall for\nher and make her rich and famous. Indeed, several other contestants - - friends of Desiree - -\ntestified that after meeting Mike Tyson, Desiree bragged to her friend that she was going out with\nhim because \"this is Mike Tyson. He's got a lot of money. He's dumb. You see what Robin\nGivens got out of him.\" She told another friend that \"Robin Givens had him. I can have him too\n... He's dumb anyway.\" To her roommate, she said: \"Mike doesn't have to know how to speak\nwell. He'll make all the money and I'll do the talking.\"\n\nTyson testified that he was blunt, direct and unambiguous about what he wanted from\nWashington. When he asked her out—in front of a witness—she suggested a movie or dinner. But\nhe said no: \"That's not what I [have] in mind... I want you. I want to fuck you.\" The\nwitness—Johnny Gill, a singer—testified that Tyson said, \"I want to fuck.\" Gill later asked Tyson\nhow he could be so straightforward with women, and Tyson explained that he is used to saying\nwhat is on his mind.\n\nDesiree Washington knew full well that Mike wanted to have sex with her when she went to his\nhotel room after two o'clock in the morning. Yet she testified that she had no idea that Tyson had\nany interest in having sex. How any rational person could believe that, especially in light of what\nis now known about Washington, is mind-boggling. She may have been disappointed and hurt\nwhen he treated her like a groupie—a one-night stand—rather than as a continuing romantic\ninterest. She realized that she could not exploit his sexual interest in her the way Robin Givens\nhad done, and she was afraid of the reaction of her friends and family when it became known that\nshe had indulged in a one-night stand with Tyson. A friend of hers told the press that Desiree\n\"only cried rape\" after her furious father found out she'd had sex with Tyson.\n\nOur investigation revealed that she had had previously engaged in consensual sex with an\nathlete—the high school football hero—and when her father found out about it and threatened to\nbeat her, she lied to her father and told him she had been raped, thus falsely accusing the football\nplayer.\n\n239\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017326\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The\nfirst of these three rights—the right to be reasonably protected—is already\nclearly extended by another statute to crime victims before the filing of\ncharges. While OLC does not acknowledge this fact, the VRRA extends\nthe first right to crime victims, directing that a “responsible official shall\narrange for a victim to receive reasonable protection from a suspected\noffender and persons acting in concert with or at the behest of the suspected\noffender.”'*! Because a “suspected” offender obviously exists before the\nfiling of criminal charges, the VRRA envisions the right to protection being\nprovided as soon as is practical after a victim suffers from the commission\nof a crime. Additionally, the sections of the Attorney General Guidelines\nfor Victim and Witness Assistance addressing the VRRA direct that Justice\nDepartment components must provide reasonable protection even before the\nfiling of criminal charges.'*? So, under the VRRA, the Justice Department\nshould already be providing reasonable protection for a victim before an\noffender is indicted, regardless of how the CVRA is interpreted!”\n\nThe VRRA, however, does not contain a right to confer and a right to\nfair treatment and respect for the victim’s dignity. Therefore, if victims are\ngoing to receive these statutory rights before trial, these rights must be\nfound in the CVRA. With regard to the CVRA provision that victims have\nthe “reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the\ncase,”!*+ OLC contends that “[t]he phrase ‘in the case’ implies the pendency\nof a judicial proceeding.”'*? To bolster its conclusion, OLC then cites\nBlack’s Law Dictionary, which includes among its several definitions of the\nword “case” the definition “a civil or criminal proceeding.”'*° But OLC\ndoes not acknowledge that Black’s Law Dictionary also defines and\nexemplifies a “case” more broadly as a “criminal investigation <the\n\nnotification of rights before charges are filed). For purposes of this Article, it is not\nnecessary to explore this right in detail. If other CVRA rights apply before charges are filed,\na fortiori this right does as well.

It can carry out this reasoning only if its concept\ncreation process has invented the concept of “child” via analysis of observed data.\n\nIn these examples we have focused on cases where two terms in the cognitive schematic are\nfixed and the third must be filled in; but just as often, the situation is that only one of the\nterms is fixed. For instance, if we fix G, sometimes the best approach will be to collectively\nlearn C' and P. This requires either a procedure learning method that works interactively with a\ndeclarative-knowledge-focused concept learning or reasoning method; or a declarative learning\nmethod that works interactively with a procedure learning method. That is, it requires the sort\nof cognitive synergy built into the CogPrime design.\n\n8.6 Cognitive Synergy for Procedural and Declarative Learning\n\nWe now present a little more algorithmic detail regarding the operation and synergetic in-\nteraction of CogPrime’s two most sophisticated components: the MOSES procedure learning\nalgorithm (see Chapter 33), and the PLN uncertain inference framework (see Chapter 34). The\ntreatment is necessarily quite compact, since we have not yet reviewed the details of either\nMOSES or PLN; but as well as illustrating the notion of cognitive synergy more concretely,\nperhaps the high-level discussion here will make clearer how MOSES and PLN fit into the big\npicture of CogPrime.\n\n8.6.1 Cognitive Synergy in MOSES\n\nMOSES, CogPrime’s primary algorithm for learning procedural knowledge, has been tested on\na variety of application problems including standard GP test problems, virtual agent control,\nbiological data analysis and text classification [Loo06]. It represents procedures internally as\nprogram trees. Each node in a MOSES program tree is supplied with a “knob,” comprising a\nset of values that may potentially be chosen to replace the data item or operator at that node.\nSo for instance a node containing the number 7 may be supplied with a knob that can take\non any integer value. A node containing a while loop may be supplied with a knob that can\ntake on various possible control flow operators including conditionals or the identity. A node\ncontaining a procedure representing a particular robot movement, may be supplied with a knob\nthat can take on values corresponding to multiple possible movements. Following a metaphor\nsuggested by Douglas Hofstadter [Hof96], MOSES learning covers both “knob twiddling” (setting\nthe values of knobs) and “knob creation.”\n\nMOSES is invoked within CogPrime in a number of ways, but most commonly for finding a\nprocedure P satisfying a probabilistic implication C& P - G as described above, where C is an\nobserved context and G is a system goal. In this case the probability value of the implication\nprovides the “scoring function” that MOSES uses to assess the quality of candidate procedures.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013069\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Rodriguez\nstated Epstein did not want to see or hear the staff when he was in\nresidence.\n\nI asked Rodriguez if Epstein received many guests during his stay in\nPalm Beach. Rodriguez advised he had many guests. I asked\nspecifically about masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated he\nwould have two massages a day. Epstein would have one massage in the\nmorning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence.\nRodriguez stated he would_be informed to expect someone and make them\ncomfortable until either or Epstein would meet with them.\n\nRodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them\n\nentry into the kitchen area and offer them something to drink or eat.\n\nThey would then be encountered by either MJ or Epstein. They\n\nwould be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if\n\nany of the masseuses appeared young in age. He advised he didn't ask\n\ntheir ages but felt they were very young. Rodriguez stated they ate\n\nlike his own daughter who is in high school. Rodriguez stated they\n\nwould eat tons of cereal and drink milk all the time.. Rodriguez\n\nstated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be\n\nmasseuses. He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered\n\na dozen roses top TT for one of the girls b6\n\nthat came to provide a massage.

He described the armoire as a small wood\n\narmoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's bed.\n\nEpstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a\ncar for the same girl he brought the roses to, so that she could drive\nher self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the girl\nalways needed rides to and from the house. Rodriguez referred himself\nas a \"human ATM machine\" and was ordered by Epstein to maintain a\nminimum balance of $2,000 dollars on him at all times.

That’s what\nhumans contribute; that’s what our civilization contributes. The execution of those goals\nis what we can increasingly automate. What will the future of humans be in such a\nworld? What will there be for them to do? One of my projects has been to understand\nthe evolution of human purposes over time. Today we’ve got all kinds of purposes. If\nyou look back a thousand years, people’s goals were quite different: How do I get my\nfood? How do I keep myself safe? In the modern Western world, for the most part you\ndon’t spend a large fraction of your life thinking about those purposes. From the point of\nview of a thousand years ago, some of the goals people have today would seem utterly\nbizarre—for example, like exercising on a treadmill. A thousand years ago that would\nsound like a crazy thing to do.\n\nWhat will people be doing in the future? A lot of purposes we have today are\ngenerated by scarcity of one kind or another. There are scarce resources in the world.\nPeople want to get more of something. Time itself is scarce in our lives. Eventually,\nthose forms of scarcity will disappear. The most dramatic discontinuity will surely be\nwhen we achieve effective human immortality. Whether this will be achieved\nbiologically or digitally isn’t clear, but inevitably it will be achieved. Many of our\ncurrent goals are driven in part by our mortality: “I’m only going to live a certain time, so\nI'd better get this or that done.” And what happens when most of our goals are executed\nautomatically? We won’t have the kinds of motivations we have today. One question I’d\nlike an answer for is, What do the derivatives of humans in the future end up choosing to\ndo with themselves? One of the potential bad outcomes is that they just play video games\nall the time.\n\nThe term “artificial intelligence” is evolving, in its use in technical language. These\ndays, AI is very popular, and people have some idea of what it means. Back when\ncomputers were being developed, in the 1940s and 1950s, the typical title of a book or a\nmagazine article about computers was “Giant Electronic Brains.” The idea was that just\nas bulldozers and steam engines and so on automated mechanical work, computers would\nautomate intellectual work. That promise turned out to be harder to fulfill than many\npeople expected. There was, at first, a great deal of optimism; a lot of government\nmoney got spent on such efforts in the early 1960s. They basically just didn’t work.\n\nThere are a lot of amusing science-fiction-ish portrayals of computers in the\nmovies of that time. There’s a cute one called Desk Set, which is about an IBM-type\ncomputer being installed in a broadcasting company and putting everybody out of a job.\nIt’s cute because the computer gets asked a bunch of reference-library questions. When\nmy colleagues and I were building Wolfram|Alpha, one of the ideas we had was to get it\nto answer all of those reference-library questions from Desk Set. By 2009, it could\nanswer them all.\n\nIn 1943, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts came up with a model for how\nbrains conceptually, formally, might work—an artificial neural network. They saw that\ntheir brainlike model would do computations in the same way as Turing Machines. From\ntheir work, it emerged that we could make brainlike neural networks that would act as\ngeneral computers. And in fact, the practical work done by the ENIAC folks and John\n\n183\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016986\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This change took me by\nsurprise.\n\nIn the conclusion to my 1991 book, Chutzpah, I predicted the end of mainstream, top-down anti-\nSemitism in America, and its replacement by anti-Zionism. I also predicted “a sharp decline in\nsupport for Israel among college and university students,” who will be “tomorrow’s leaders.” I\nshould have, but did not anticipate that the new anti-Zionism would morph into anti-Semitism, at\nleast for some. I should have because the hatred of Israel by the hard left and the Islamic right\nwas So irrational, so off the charts, so extreme, that it could be explained only by a hatred for\nIsrael’s Jewishness. A confrontation I experienced in 2004 was all too typical:\n\nIt took place in front of Faneuil Hall, the birthplace of American independence and liberty. I was\nreceiving a justice award and delivering a talk from the podium of that historic hall on civil\nliberties in the age of terrorism. When I left, award in hand, I was accosted by a group of\nscreaming, angry young men and women carrying virulently anti-Israel signs. The sign carriers\nwere shouting epithets at me that crossed the line from civility to bigotry. “Dershowitz and Hitler,\njust the same, the only difference is the name.” The sin that, in the opinion of the screamers,\nwatranted this comparison between me and the man who murdered dozens of my family members\nwas my support for Israel.\n\nIt was irrelevant to these chanters that I also support a Palestinian state, the end of the Israeli\noccupation, and the dismantling of most of the settlements. The protestors also shouted,\n“Dershowitz and Gibbels [sic], just the same, the only difference is the name”—not even knowing\nhow to pronounce the name of the anti-Semitic Nazi butcher.\n\nOne sign carrier shouted that Jews who support Israel are worse than Nazis. Another demanded\nthat I be tortured and killed. It was not only their words; it was the hatred in their eyes. If a dozen\nBoston police had not been protecting me, I have little doubt I would have been physically\nattacked. The protestors’ eyes were ablaze with fanatical zeal.\n\nThe feminist writer Phyllis Chesler aptly describes the hatred some young people often direct\nagainst Israel and supporters of the Jewish state as “eroticized.” That is what I saw: passionate\nhatred, ecstatic hatred, orgasmic hatred. It was beyond mere differences of opinion.\n\nWhen I looked into their faces, I could imagine young Nazis in the 1930s in Hitler’s Germany.\nThey had no doubt that they were right and that I was pure evil for my support of the Jewish\nstate, despite my public disagreement with some of Israel’s policies and despite my support for\nPalestinian statehood.\n\nThere was no place for nuance here. It was black and white, good versus evil, and any Jew who\nsupported Israel was pure evil, deserving of torture, violence, and whatever fate Hitler and\nGoebbels deserved.\n\nTo be sure, these protestors’ verbal attack on me was constitutionally protected speech, just as\nthe Nazi march through Skokie was constitutionally protected speech. But the shouting was\nplainly calculated to intimidate. An aura of violence was in the air, and had the police not been\nthere, I would not have been able to express any views counter to theirs.\n\n353\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017440\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Colonel Eli Zeira was head of the “collection department” of the\nintelligence corps, the rough equivalent of America’s National Security Agency.\nFormally, Sayeret Matkal was part of his department. He called together all the\nofficers. He said that there had so far been three periods in the Zionist project.\nThe first was from the early settlements in Palestine at the end of the 19th\ncentury until the establishment of Israel in 1948. The second, from 1948 until\nthe 1956 War. The third from 1956 until now. Then he said: “There will soon be\na war. Three Arab countries will take part. Within a week, we will defeat all of\nthem. And a new chapter in the history of Zionism will begin.”\n\nThe Six-Day War began on June 5, 1967. As Eli Zeira so confidently\npredicted, not just Egypt and Syria, but Jordan, too, joined forces against us.\nAnd it was indeed all over within a week. The final outcome — Israel’s victory —\nwas sealed by noon on the first day, with wave after wave of pre-emptive\nbombing sorties destroying the entire air force of all three Arab countries. But\nthe fighting which followed was brutal in places: especially around Jerusalem,\nbut also in the south at the outset of the war, and later on the Golan Heights.\n\nThe first effect back in Israel of our air force attacks was to make our sayeret\nhelicopter missions into the Sinai suddenly superfluous. In fact, it left the entire\nunit at loose ends — especially veterans or reservists like me who had been part\nof our nearly decade-long development into Israel’s sole, dedicated cross-border\ninfiltration force. At this point, we were still just an intelligence unit, not an\nelite commando force like Britain’s SAS, Avraham Aranan’s ultimate vision for\nthe sayeret. The aim of our bugging missions into Syria and Egypt was not to\nfight. It was to get in and get out, unseen and undetected. But we were not only\nequipped to fight if necessary. From the unit’s earliest days under the sway of\nMeir Har-Zion, Kapusta and Gibli and Errol and the other grizzled vets from\nUnit 101 and Company A, we had been steeped in the spirit of commandos. Our\ntraining was the most rigorous in the Israeli armed forces, involving not just a\npunishing endurance régime but learning to assemble and disassemble, fire and\ndetonate, everything from handguns to machine guns, makeshift explosives to\ngrenades and landmines.\n\nThe frustration we felt on the first morning of the war was not because we\nwere itching to fight, for the hell of it. One hallmark of the sayeret’s ethos,\nespecially once the unit did start to evolve into a full-fledged commando unit,\n\n88\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011559\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I use a standard piece of paper folded in half three times,\nwhich fits perfectly in the pocket and limits you to noting only a few items.\n\nThere should never be more than two mission-critical items to complete each day. Never. It just isn’t\nnecessary if they’re actually high-impact. If you are stuck trying to decide between multiple items that all\nseem crucial, as happens to all of us, look at each in turn and ask yourself, Jf this is the only thing I\naccomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day?\n\nTo counter the seemingly urgent, ask yourself: What will happen if I don’t do this, and is it worth\nputting off the important to do it? If you haven’t already accomplished at least one important task in the\nday, don’t spend the last business hour returning a DVD to avoid a $5 late charge. Get the important task\ndone and pay the $5 fine.\n\n7. Put a Post-it on your computer screen or set an Outlook reminder to alert you at least three\ntimes daily with the question: Are you inventing things to do to avoid the important?\n\nI also use free time-tracking software called RescueTime (www.rescuetime.com) to alert me when I\nspend more than an allotted time on certain websites or programs often used to avoid the important\n(Gmail, Facebook, Outlook, etc.).

Trying to brush your teeth, talk on the phone, and answer\ne-mail at the same time just doesn’t work. Eating while doing online research and instant messaging?\nDitto.\n\nIf you prioritize properly, there is no need to multitask. It is a symptom of “task creep” —doing more\nto feel productive while actually accomplishing less. As stated, you should have, at most, two primary\ngoals or tasks per day. Do them separately from start to finish without distraction. Divided attention will\nresult in more frequent interruptions, lapses in concentration, poorer net results, and less gratification.\n\n9.

This will focus you to prioritize more effectively and quite possibly develop a social life. If you’re\nunder the hawklike watch of a boss, we’ll discuss the nuts and bolts of how to escape in later chapters.\n\nOn a micro task level, limit the number of items on your to-do list and use impossibly short deadlines\nto force immediate action while ignoring minutiae.\n\nIf doing work online or near an online computer, http://e.ggtimer.com/ is a convenient countdown\ntimer.

It also\nworks with multiplication. If I have zero lots of 4 cakes, I have no cakes.\nZero times four is zero, so multiplication with zero works. There is one\nembarrassing exception, if I divide by zero I seem to get infinity. When I\nwas a child this was a definition for infinity, but nowadays mathematicians\nsimply forbid the operation. Division by zero is not allowed and if you\ntry it on your computer, you will get the not terribly useful, #DIV/0!\nError. That’s progress I guess!\n\nZero had been tamed. What about infinity?\n\nCantor showed that while you could think of infinity as a number,\nit might not be just one number. He proposed there are many infinities.\nIn fact, there are a greater than infinite number of them! He did this\nthrough a rigorous analysis of a new branch of mathematics called set\ntheory.\n\nSet theory is now the cornerstone of modern mathematics, but it\nwas treated with suspicion in Cantor's time. Rather than embrace the new\nthinking, many mathematicians ridiculed it; Poincaré wrote that Cantor’s\nideas were a grave disease infecting the discipline of mathematics! This\nseems odd given our modern propensity to embrace innovation, but the\ntone of science back then was different: innovation was not necessarily\nconsidered a good thing.\n\nAt the turn of the 20\" century, scientists were on a mission to tidy\nthings up. Lord Kelvin announced in 1890 that mankind had discovered\neverything there was to know and the role of future scientists was simply\nto catalogue and observe the consequences of these laws, and to improve\nthe accuracy of measurement. The last thing scientists wanted was a\ncompletely new set of numbers that behaved in strange ways. Cantor was\nupsetting the apple cart, but he was in good company. Just a few miles\naway in Berlin, a young Albert Einstein was beginning to study physics\nin his spare time. Those studies would culminate in his four papers of\n1905, two on Quantum Mechanics and two on Relativity, ushering in the\nmodern age of physics.\n\nHow to Count\n\nTo understand infinity you need to count in a particular way. You’re\nprobably used to counting with numbers. You count apples: one, two,\nthree, and say, “I have three apples.” You can do the same with oranges.\nIf you have three apples and three oranges, the totals are the same and\nyou can declare you have the same number of fruits.

Two\nof them sued the federal government in\n2008 under the Crime Victims’ Rights\nAct, which grants crime victims the\nright to be informed about plea deals\nand to confer with prosecutors.\n\nMarra, in a 33-page opinion, said\nprosecutors not only intentionally vio-\nlated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, but\nthey misled the girls into believing that\nthe FBI's sex trafficking case against Ep-\nstein was ongoing — when, in fact, pros-\necutors had secretly closed it after sealing\nthe plea bargain from the public record.\n\nMarra, noting that he reviewed affi-\ndavits, depositions and interrogatories,\nsaid “Epstein worked in concert with\nothers to obtain minors not only for his\nown sexual gratification, but also for\nthe sexual gratification of others.”\n\nThe victims’ attorneys — Edwards,\nScarola and Paul Cassell — have asked\nthe Justice Department to throw out\nEpstein’ plea agreement and reopen\nthe criminal investigation.\n\nEdwards, who brought the victims’\nrights case against the government,\nsaid transferring the case to another ju-\nrisdiction is a prudent decision,\n\n“I think it's good that we're going\nto get fresh eyes and a fresh opinion\non the way the case was handled,” Ed-\nwards said Tuesday.\n\nMiami’ new U.S. attorney, Ariana\nFajardo Orshan — who was appointed\nby Trump in September — did not re-\nspond to a request for comment.\n\nAcosta, who was appointed by Trump\nas the U.S. secretary of labor in 2017, is\nthe focus of a separate Justice Depart-\nment investigation into whether there\nwas any prosecutorial misconduct in the\nEpstein case. That probe, by the DOJ\nOffice of Professional Responsibility,\nwas initiated in response to demands\nfrom a bipartisan group in Congress,\nled by Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of\nNebraska and Democratic Rep. Debbie\nWasserman Schultz of Florida.\n\n: Notary Public\n- Photocopies - Emailing\nFaxing - Lamination\n\nA\nAA\n\nNATION\n\nThe Virgin Islands Daily News 9\n\nOrthopedic Joint Care for\nThe USVI and The Caribbean Region\n\nCOG St. Thomas & St. John * Foothills Professional Bldg * Ste 206 * 340-779-2663\n\n“ame the arthanedir cervic,\ncome tne Oo. rthopedic Services\n\ngion.\n\niedical care\n\nf payments\n\nathe\n) MEeUMoG:\n\nog eS AE RP a AF a.

Spicer was forced to deliver this\nunlikely rationale, as was the vice president. But this pretense unraveled almost\nimmediately, not least because most everyone in the West Wing, wanting nothing to do\nwith the decision to fire Comey, was helping to unravel tt.\n\nThe president, along with his family, stood on one side of the White House divide,\nwhile the staff—mouths agape, disbelieving and speechless—stood on the other.\n\nBut the president seemed also to want it known that he, aroused and dangerous,\npersonally took down Comey. Forget Rosenstein and Sessions, it was personal. It was a\npowerful president and a vengeful one, in every way galled and affronted by those in\npursuit of him, and determined to protect his family, who were in turn determined to have\nhim protect them.\n\n“The daughter will take down the father,” said Bannon, in a Shakespearian mood.\n\nWithin the West Wing there was much replaying of alternative scenarios. If you wanted\nto get rid of Comey, there were surely politic ways of doing it—which had in fact been\nsuggested to Trump. (A curious one—an idea that later would seem ironic—was to get rid\nof General Kelly at Homeland Security and move Comey into that job.) But the point\nreally was that Trump had wanted to confront and humiliate the FBI director. Cruelty was\na Trump attribute.\n\nThe firing had been carried out publicly and in front of his family—catching Comey\nentirely off guard as he gave a speech in California. Then the president had further\npersonalized the blow with an ad hominem attack on the director, suggesting that the FBI\nitself was on Trump’s side and that it, too, had only contempt for Comey.\n\nThe next day, as though to further emphasize and delight in both the insult and his\npersonal impunity, the president met with Russian bigwigs in the Oval Office, including\nRussia’s Ambassador Kislyak, the very focus of much of the Trump-Russia investigation.\nTo the Russians he said: “I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job. I\nfaced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.” Then, to boot, he revealed\ninformation supplied to the United States by Israel from its agent in place in Syria about\nISIS using laptops to smuggle bombs onto airlines—revealing enough information to\ncompromise the Israeli agent. (This incident did not help Trump’s reputation in\nintelligence circles, since, in spycraft, human sources are to be protected above all other\nsecrets.)\n\n“It’s Trump,” said Bannon. “He thinks he can fire the FBI.”\n\nOOK Ok\n\nTrump believed that firing Comey would make him a hero. Over the next forty-eight hours\nhe spun his side to various friends. It was simple: he had stood up to the FBI.

While President-elect Trump has vowed to act\nquickly on repeal of the ACA, it is difficult to see how that\ncan be accomplished outside of reconciliation instructions\nfor FY 2018. “When we win on November 8th, and elect a\nRepublican Congress, we will be able to immediately\nrepeal and replace Obamacare. | will ask Congress to\nconvene a special session,” he said November 1.\n\nAn early focus of attention will be the first Trump budget\nproposal and the congressional FY 2018 budget\nresolution. As with the past several years under divided\ngovernment, a main issue will be how to address the\nBudget Control Act sequester for FY 2018. According to\nthe Congressional Budget Office, the cap on discretionary\nbudget authority originally established by the Budget\nControl Act is set at $1.156 billion in 2018, though it will\nbe reduced by automatic procedures unless Congress\nintervenes. CBO said the reduction will total $91 billion\nfor 2018: $54 billion for defense and $37 billion in 2018\nfor nondefense. Therefore, total budget authority is\nslatedto be $1.065 trillion, split between $549 billion for\ndefense and $516 billion for nondefense. Both Trump and\nSpeaker Ryan want to eliminate the sequester as it\napplies to defense, but would likely want to maintain the\nsequester for non-defense spending.\n\nAs reported in Politico last month, Speaker Ryan is bullish\non using the “budget reconciliation” process to pass\nsignificant tax reform. “Thisis our plan for 2017,” Ryan\nsaid, waving a copy of his “Better Way” policy agenda.\n“Much of this you can do through budget reconciliation.”\nHe said key pieces are “fiscal in nature,” meaning they\ncan be moved quickly through a budget maneuver that\nrequires a simple majority in the Senate and House.\n\nUse of “Budget Reconciliation” to enact legislation\ninvolves a two-step process. First, both Chambers of\nCongress need to pass a concurrent Budget Resolution\n(requires only simple majority in the Senate) that contains\n“reconciliation instructions.” These instructions are\ndirections to committees of jurisdiction to change the\nspending or revenue numbers (or both), and to report\nback the changes by a date certain. A budget resolution\ngenerally is a legislative vehicle that servesas the\nblueprint for fiscal policy and establishes a framework for\nconsideration of spending and revenue bills for the\ncoming fiscal year. Technically, a budget resolution isa\n“concurrent resolution” which is binding in the House and\nthe Senate. Because a concurrent resolution is not\nsubmitted to the President for signature, it does not have\nthe force of law.\n\nThe second part of the process is to pass “reconciliation”\nbills that adhere to the reconciliation instructions from\nthe budget resolution.\n\nReconciliation bills can involve changes to spending,\nrevenue, or the debt limit (or any combination of the\nthree). Importantly, these reconciliation bills also only\nrequire a simple majority in the House and Senate for\npassage.\n\nReconciliation bills carry strict debate time and\namendment restrictions, but unlike a budget resolution,\nreconciliation legislation contains specific spending and\nrevenue policy changes that are signed into law by the\nPresident. In the Senate, debate is limited to 20 hours.\nWhile only a simple majority is required for passage in the\nSenate, 60 votes are required to waive violations of the\nso-called “Byrd rule,” which prohibits the inclusion of\nprovisions that increase the budget deficit for the period\noutside the budget window, usually a 10-year period. An\nunlimited number of amendments may be offered and\nvoted upon, even after the 20 hours of debate have\nexpired —a process often referred to as a “vote-a-rama’.\n\nThis process is attractive because of the simple majority\nvote in the Senate, but carries with it restrictionssuch as\nthe ten-year expiration for titles of the bill that increase\nthe deficit outside the budget window.\n\nIt was used by President George W. Bush to pass\nsignificant tax cut legislation in 2001 (the “Bush tax\ncuts”) and is expected to be considered next year for tax\nreform. Note that the Bush tax cuts were originally\nsunsetted at the end of ten years due to the Byrd\n\nrule. Subsequent legislation passed outside reconciliation\nprocess made many of these provisions permanent.\n\nEY °\n\n| Election 2016\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022381\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Below is the letter I'm sending out to my friends and supporters, and at the bottom a \nmessage just for you.... \n-Lisa \nThat you are receiving this letter means that you are among a special community of friends whose \nsupport— financial, moral, intellectual, logistical— has allowed my initiative, Poetry in America, to \nrealize what seemed, a year ago, almost certainly too ambitious a vision. That vision was to \nproduce the highest quality educational video on American poetry, creating a body of \nhumanities content capable of reaching a broad community of learners: formal and informal, \nonline and residential, young and old, American and international. And it was to \nbegin— rapidly— to disseminate and distribute our work. \nWhether you donated to Poetry in America through Filmmaker's Collaborative (our 501c3 fiscal \nsponsor), through Harvard, or through WGBH; whether you appeared on camera or talked an elusive \nfriend into appearing on camera to discuss a poem; whether you lent us your film crew, or provided \novernight use of your hotel suite or apartment or of your whole skyscraper; whether you highlighted \nour work on your stage, or talked your colleagues into becoming corporate sponsors; whether you \nflew to Boston to install state-of-the-art editing and video storage equipment, or asked your children's \nschool to let us film there; whether you encouraged your family foundation to take an interest in the \nproject, or gave us a lesson in IP, in licensing, in the rudiments of finance, or of distribution; whether \nyou praised, or gave timely, much-needed criticism— you enabled what we have done. \nHere's what we have to report, and to show, a year later, thanks to your help. Links offer sneak peeks \nof works -in-progress across the full portfolio of Poetry in America projects. \n• The first eight-episode season of the public television series Poetry in America (a co-\nproduction between WGBH, Emmy Award-winning filmmaker David Grubin, and my own new \nproduction company, Verse Video), is now fully funded and in production, with episodes featuring Bill  \nClinton, Herbie Hancock and Sonia Sanchez on Langston Hughes, Frank Gehry on Carl Sandburg, \nKatie Couric on Elizabeth Bishop, Nas on Whitman, and many more scheduled for nationwide launch \nin 2017. \n• Poetry in America's many initiatives to reach Middle and High School teachers and their \nstudents are taking root. Our first online course for Middle and High School Teachers, Poetry of \nthe City, will launch this Spring with the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Companion \nmaterials to this course will be made available for free on PBS LearningMedia. This course is \ndesigned to meet the needs of English Language Arts and Social Studies teachers in the US and \ninternationally. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028943 \n• We are eager to begin production of The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky. Designed, too, for \nMiddle and High School teachers, The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky will draw English Language Arts \ninstruction into dialogue with science, and will include extraordinary footage of the natural world, \nconversations with poets, scholars, and scientists as well as footage shot in class and in the field with \ngreat teachers. \n• A recent partnership with Greenwich Country Day School and the Success Academy Network \nof charter schools will provide a base for the production of a new collection of classroom-ready \neducational material on The Poetry of Art Sport, and Play. This collection will include discussions \non poems filmed everywhere from sports fields to Broadway theaters, and will feature dancers, \nathletes, fashion designers, and more. \n• With a growing archive of footage capturing teachers and students reading American poems, \nwe are eager to expand our reach and move into America's schools, disseminating, testing, \nand learning from teachers and students using our materials. We hope to be able to begin work \nevaluating the impact of poetry on literacy levels and character development and, eventually, to \nproduce a full suite of materials that foster character development along with intellectual growth. \nWorking closely with such partners as The Nantucket Project, Nautilus Magazine, The Aspen Ideas \nFestival, and The Big Think, and, of course, HarvardX, Harvard's provider of free open online \ncourses, we are continuing to create rich educational media on poetry for adult learners and \nlifelong learners. These materials include short form videos such as this one on Robert Pinsky's  \n\"Shirt\" (as featured in The New Yorker), and, this spring, the sixth module of the free seven-part \nPoetry in America MOOC, which has registrants in over 150 countries. \nGrowing rapidly, and outpacing our current staff and infrastructure, Poetry in America has a \nfundraising goal this year of 2.5 million dollars to fund its expanding group of projects. We've taken a \nbig step, hiring the design agency Threespot to help us develop our web presence. Our website— to \nlaunch early 2016— will eventually serve as an online hub for our TV show and educational projects. \nWe hope you'll join us then for a virtual launch! \nFinally, Jeffrey, you have been such a wonderful supporter of my Poetry in America project. The Leon \nBlack gift changed everything for me last year. It paid salaries for staff I desperately needed to \ncomplete projects (detail below), but first and foremost, it gave me leverage, enabling me to set down \na solid Harvard base for my activities by giving the school something to point to: this public \nhumanities project among the list of projects the Dean supports. The money did it: as soon as they \nheard about the gift, they took my project more seriously. Because of that gift, the Faculty of Arts and \nSciences, which is space-stingy, found and rewired a studio space for me to house my video \nproduction operation and team. That gift woke up the Deans to the importance of Harvard's role in \nproducing the highest quality humanities content for the WORLD, and not just for Harvard students. \nMy main employee has half of her salary paid with these funds, and the foundation of our collection \nfor PBS LeamingMedia is being made with this support. This gift represented one of the most \nconsequential shifts of the last year, allowing me create content and launch projects this year that \nmake future projects that much more likely. If I can keep this base sturdy at Harvard, refilling these \ncoffers, I will be that much more able to keep working. \nI am also so grateful for the help you gave me in defining my project for Templeton, and, what help \nyou have offered to give in bringing them around. I have, since Templeton turned me down, gotten \nfunding to produce video on two of the poems I'd proposed to Templeton and to create, and test, that \nvideo in schools as I proposed. One of my partners in that project is Success Academy, where I could \nalso expand my work with Templeton. And there are still other poems that may satisfy their character \ncriteria more fully, including the third of the poems I'd originally proposed and that Joe Biden had \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028944 \nagreed to discuss with me (on parenthood and humility). At this point, I'm gaining the platform and the \nname recognition to be an effective spokesperson for the foundation on building literacy and \ncharacter in the schools. \nIt really means a lot to me, all financial help aside, Jeffrey, that you are rooting for me and thinking \nabout me. You push back a lot (as Larry does), and it's always annoying but I always learn. \nWith abundant gratitude, \nLisa \nElisa New \nPowell M.

In assessing the impact of\nvarious taxes, individual income taxes are allocated directly to households paying those taxes. Social insurance, or\npayroll, taxes are allocated to households paying those taxes directly or paying them indirectly through their\nemployers. Corporate income taxes are allocated to households according to their share of capital income. Federal\n\nexcise taxes are allocated to households according to their consumption of the taxed good or service.\n\nAverage tax rates are calculated by dividing federal taxes paid by the sum of market income and transfer income.\nNegative tax rates result from refundable tax credits, such as the earned income and child tax credits, exceeding the\nother taxes owed by people in an income group. (Refundable tax credits are not limited to the amount of income tax\n\nowed before they are applied.)\n\nThe Gini Index\n\nThe Gini Index is a measure of income inequality based on the relationship between shares of income and shares of\nthe population. It is a value between 0 and 1.0, with 0 indicating complete equality and 1.0 indicating complete\ninequality (in which one household receives all the income). A Gini Index that increases over time indicates rising\n\nincome dispersion.\n\nChart 8 details\nData from Berg, Ostry, and Zettelmeyer (2008).\n\nAuthors’ calculations: The height of each factor represents the percentage change in a growth spell between 1950 and\n2006 when the factor moves from the 50th percentile to the 60th percentile and all other factors are held constant.\nIncome distribution uses the Gini coefficient. The political institutions factor is based on an index from the Polity IV\nProject database that ranges from +10 for the most open and democratic societies to —10 for the most closed and\nautocratic. Trade openness measures the effect of changes in trade liberalization on year-to-year growth.\nExchange-rate competitiveness is calculated as the deviation of an exchange rate from purchasing power parity,\n\nadjusted for per capita income.\n\nEndnotes\n(1) \"The General Theory,\" J.

Because Dayan\nhad been called back as Defense Minister only days before the war, he had\nwisely decided not to alter the plan for the preemptive air strikes. But he did\nadjust our ground advance. Just as with Eshkol’s knowledge of the initial\nEgyptian advance in the Sinai before the war, Dayan’s judgements were\ninformed by detailed, real-time intelligence on where enemy tanks and troops\nwere located, what they were doing, and what how and when they were\nplanning to advance.\n\nAs speculation mounted after the war about how Israel seemed to know so\nmuch the Arab forces, Meir Amit’s successor as Head of Military Intelligence,\nAhrahle Yariv, even engaged in some misdirection. He was anxious to avoid\njeopardizing future sayeret bugging operations. In a speech on how the war had\nbeen won, he included a reference to a “high-ranking spy” in the Egyptian army\nwho, he implied, had leaked critical information. The “spy” was the series of\nintercepts we’d attached to the Egyptians’ main military communications\nnetwork in the Sinai, and to the telephone poles on the Golan Heights.\n\nOn a deeply personal level, too, the war left its mark on Sayeret Matkal.\nThough the fighting had been brief, people did die. Thousands of Egyptians,\nSyrians and Jordanians. And about 650 Israelis. Some of were not just people\nwe knew. They included close friends. Nechemia Cohen, the officer I’d joined in\nour failed attempt to defuse the booby-trap in the Sinai before the war, entered\nGaza on the first day in his new role as deputy commander of Amsalem’s\nparatroop unit. Amsalem was killed early on, so Nechemia took command. He\nwas shot and killed fifteen minutes later. To this day, he and I share the\ndistinction of being the most decorated soldiers in Israel’s history.

And yet Iran also chose to convert some of its stockpile of\nhighly enriched uranium for medical use rather than approach the amount\nneeded for a bomb, leading Israeli authorities to predict that Iran wouldn't\nbe able to build a bomb before 2015 or 2016. Last week, Ali Akbar\nVelayati, Khamenei's foreign policy advisor, publicly criticized officials\nwho have treated the negotiations dismissively. Presumably, he was\nthinking of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has compared Iran's\nnuclear program to a train without brakes.\n\nIran is now at the outset of what promises to be a raucous presidential\nelection, and may be no more capable of serious negotiations between now\nand June than the United States was in 2012.

Or Iran could suspend\n20-percent enrichment in exchange for a suspension of new sanctions. But\nIran is unlikely to accept even such small steps unless it felt that additional\nmoves would win additional explicit concessions.\n\nBeyond that, the outlines of what in Middle East peacemaking is known as\n\"final status\" are clear enough: Iran agrees to verifiable inspections to\nensure that it does not enrich uranium beyond 3.5 percent and does not\npursue a nuclear weapons program, while the West accepts Iran's \"right to\nenrich\" and dismantles sanctions.

The sooner we learn, however, the less we\nwill suffer. Mirroring has always been a key component of those lessons.\n\nI have been encouraged by some recent acts that have begu n to nip at the asymmetry. For years, the language\nof “feeling s” had been reserved for our enemy while we were limited to that of “action;” we would do terrible\nacts that would cause bad feelings in the enemy which would then serve to justify whatever response it made. It\nhad always been a question of the harsh insensitive acts Westerners do against Muslims and the resulting hurt,\nloss, shame etc. that Muslims experience. The Ground Zero Mosque incident, however, broke new ground\nbecause all of a sudden non-Muslims’ feelings became the focus and were cast as resulting from Muslim acts.\nAnother example was seen in how quickly the attempt to blame the Benghazi murders on the video about\nMohammad fell apart. Just as large corporations eventually learned to turn away from shakedown attempts from\nrace baiters, we are beginning to learn to demand symmetry through mirroring. A word of caution: When\nenablers change their behavior and demand symmetrical rules f or the addict, the latter typically initially erupts\nwith great resistance. This is a stage we must be prepared to tolerate and fully withstand as it creates the only\nreal chance for the addict to finally change.

Tolerating the intolerant is perhaps the most crystalline version of asymmetry we\nhave accepted. Seriously engaged Muslims MUST place the Koran above all law while in America, the\nConstitution ranks supreme. As Omar Ahmad , founder of CAIR, reputedly said, “Islam isn’t in Amer ica to be\nequal to any other faith, but to become dominant. The Koran is the highest authority in America and Islam is the\nonly accepted religion on Earth.” Who makes law- the people or Allah? While the Control Factor constantly\nseeks for some accommodation between the two, this conflict CAN NOT be negotiated. Only one can survive\nnot because we have declared “war” but because our Islamic Enemy has. That is, perhaps, the lesson we will\nmost need to fully learn, one way or another.

Similarly, the exponential advances in Moore’s Law are\nstarting to run into limits imposed by basic physics. The clock speed of computers\nmaxed out at a few gigahertz a decade and a half ago, simply because the chips were\nstarting to melt. The miniaturization of transistors is already running into quantum-\nmechanical problems due to tunneling and leakage currents. Eventually, the various\nexponential improvements in memory and processing driven by Moore’s Law will\ngrind to a halt. A few more decades, however, will probably be time enough for the\nraw information-processing power of computers to match that of brains—at least by\nthe crude measures of number of bits and number of bit-flips per second.\n\nHuman brains are intricately constructed, the process of millions of years of\nnatural selection. In Wiener’s time, our understanding of the architecture of the brain\nwas rudimentary and simplistic. Since then, increasingly sensitive instrumentation and\nimaging techniques have shown our brains to be far more varied in structure and\ncomplex in function than Wiener could have imagined. I recently asked Tomaso\nPoggio, one of the pioneers of modern neuroscience, whether he was worried that\ncomputers, with their rapidly increasing processing power, would soon emulate the\nfunctioning of the human brain. “Not a chance,” he replied.\n\nThe recent advances in deep learning and neuromorphic computation are very\ngood at reproducing a particular aspect of human intelligence focused on the operation\nof the brain’s cortex, where patterns are processed and recognized. These advances\nhave enabled a computer to beat the world champion not just of chess but of Go, an\nimpressive feat, but they’re far short of enabling a computerized robot to tidy a room.\n(In fact, robots with anything approaching human capability in a broad range of\nflexible movements are still far away—search “robots falling down.” Robots are good\nat making precision welds on assembly lines, but they still can’t tie their own shoes.)\n\nRaw information-processing power does not mean sophisticated information-\nprocessing power. While computer power has advanced exponentially, the programs\nby which computers operate have often failed to advance at all. One of the primary\nresponses of software companies to increased processing power is to add “useful”\nfeatures which often make the software harder to use. Microsoft Word reached its\napex in 1995 and has been slowly sinking under the weight of added features ever\nsince. Once Moore’s Law starts slowing down, software developers will be confronted\nwith hard choices between efficiency, speed, and functionality.\n\nA major fear of the singulariteers is that as computers become more involved in\ndesigning their own software they’! rapidly bootstrap themselves into achieving\nsuperhuman computational ability. But the evidence of machine learning points in the\nopposite direction. As machines become more powerful and capable of learning, they\nlearn more and more as human beings do—from multiple examples, often under the\nsupervision of human and machine teachers. Education is as hard and slow for\ncomputers as it is for teenagers. Consequently, systems based on deep learning are\nbecoming more rather than less human. The skills they bring to learning are not\n“better than” but “complementary to” human learning: Computer learning systems can\nidentify patterns that humans cannot—and vice versa. The world’s best chess players\nare neither computers nor humans but humans working together with computers.\nCyberspace is indeed inhabited by harmful programs, but these primarily take the form\nof malware—viruses notable for their malign mindlessness, not for their\n\n22\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016825\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The Golden Chain has also been used by the U.S. Treasury Department in designating persons as\nSpecially Designated Global Terrorists. See supra p. 55 n.86.\n\nThe district court committed further error by failing to credit plaintiffs’ allegations that DMI Trust, Dallah al Baraka, and\nSaleh Abdullah Kamel controlled their subsidiaries that provided material support to al-Qaeda. See SPA245, 247 (Terrorist\nAttacks V); SPA109 (DMI-Kamel); SPA60 (Terrorist Attacks I). A plaintiff sufficiently pleads an ATA claim by alleging that\nthe defendant provided material support to terrorists through an entity that the defendant controlled. See Wyatt, 785 F. Supp.\n2d at 648 (finding that plaintiffs stated an ATA claim where they alleged that company controlled intermediary through\nwhich it provided material support). As the D.C. Circuit explained, “[w]hen one entity so dominates and controls another that\nthey must be considered principal and agent, it is appropriate, under [the ATA], to look past their separate juridical identities\n*116 and to treat them as aliases.” Nat’l Council of Resistance of Iran v. Dep’t of State, 373 F.3d 152, 157 (D.C. Cir. 2004).\n\nThe plaintiffs’ allegations met this standard. For example, plaintiffs allege that DMI Trust and DMI S.A. “directly participate\nin the oversight and management of DMI Trust’s subsidiary and associate entities.” JA4329. In addition, DMI Administrative\nServices, S.A. is alleged to be “a wholly owned subsidiary directly controlled by DMI Trust,” JA4330, and DMI Trust is\nalleged to have “direct involvement” over Faisal Islamic Bank, JA4331. Plaintiffs also allege that Kamel “headed” Dallah al\nBaraka and its wholly-owned subsidiary, ABID Corp., which “exercised control and direction” over numerous subsidiaries.\nJA1782, 3122, 3832.\n\nC. The District Court Incorrectly Disregarded Extensive Allegations of Support to al-Qaeda by Defendants Dallah al\nBaraka and Saleh Abdullah Kamel in the Early to Mid 1990s\n\nThe district court also found that the plaintiffs had not pled “the requisite causal connection” for their ATA claims against\nDallah al Baraka and Saleh Abdullah Kamel because “the alleged provision of material support” to “Osama bin Laden ...\nduring the early 1990s ... is too remote from the 9/11 terrorist attacks ....” SPA247 (Terrorist Attacks V). This conclusion\nresulted from a legal error regarding the applicable pleading *117 standard and a legal error regarding the inferences that may\nreasonably be drawn about support for terrorism, especially against the backdrop of Congress’ intended scope of the ATA.\nThe court also made a critical factual error that necessitates correction.\n\nFirst, the district court incorrectly applied a heightened pleading standard regarding this specific issue. To establish causation\nwhen an undefined period of time separates the material support alleged from the terrorist attack, the district court required\nthat the plaintiffs plead:\n\nsufficient factual allegations of a connection between the material support provided and the acts of\nterrorism that caused plaintiffs’ injuries, such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that it was\nmore likely than not that the support provided by the defendant assisted the terrorists in the commission\nof the terrorist act.\n\nId. at 239 (emphasis added). The court’s “more likely than not” and “reasonable trier of fact” requirements are mconsistent\nwith Igbal/ Twombly, which only require that a plaintiff plead facts that permit “the court to draw the reasonable inference\nthat the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Jgbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949. The district court’s standard therefore\nimposed a much greater burden on the plaintiffs than is permitted at this stage of the proceeding.\n\n*118 In addition, the inference that support for al-Qaeda in the early and mid 1990s contributed to al-Qaeda’s capabilities and\nterrorist activities only a few years later, in 2001, is entirely reasonable -- indeed, any other conclusion is unreasonable.\n\nPlaintiffs’ allegation, which must at this stage be taken as true, was that support in the years leading up to the September 11\nattacks, including support for al-Qaeda in Sudan, was essential to al-Qaeda’s ability to achieve the global scale and capability\n\nWESTLAW\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023398\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Over\nmany years, he and his lawyers filed requests under the Freedom of Information Act, seeking\naccess to the government documents on the case—the documents that contained the facts that\nwere not revealed during the trial. Slowly, they pieced together the amazing scientific and\nevidentiary story that the jury never heard.\n\nIt is a story that raises the following disturbing questions;\n\nWhy would the government suppress such critical evidence? It is impossible to know the mind-\nset of the chief government lawyer in the case: Brian Murtagh, whose responsibility it was to see\nthat the defense received any evidence in the government's file, which could help the defense. We\ndo, however, know that he was aware of the contents of the lab notes. Since he wrote a memo to\na legal assistant asking him whether \"the detailed data of a lab report; as distinguished from the\nconclusions of the report, (must) be disclosed (to the defense).\" This question is significant,\nbecause the \"detailed data\" refers to the blonde wig hair, the black wool, and the human hairs,\nwhich were described in the handwritten lab notes but somehow not mentioned in the lab's final\ntyped report.\n\nMurtagh has refused comment, except for a cryptic statement that \"if there were fibers useful to\nthe defense, MacDonald's original trial lawyers should have found them\" among the crates of raw\nevidence to which they had access. Talk about needles in haystacks!\n\nHow much more exculpatory evidence may be hidden in some government file—or may have\nbeen destroyed or lost—we will probably never know. For example, a fragment of human skin\nwas found under one of Colette MacDonald's fingernails. Yet, unbelievable as it sounds, the\ngovernment claims that it lost this singularly important item of evidence. Prosecutors in several\nother cases in which I’ve been involved have mysteriously “lost” evidence that could prove\ninnocence. If that skin fragment were now available, it could prove conclusively—through DNA\nmatching—whether or not Jeffrey MacDonald was the killer. Even without DNA testing (which\nwas not available at the time of the original investigation) it could have cleared MacDonald.\n\nWill the new evidence finally get Jeffrey MacDonald the new trial he has been seeking since he\nwas convicted in 1979? Ifthe government suppressed the lab notes and other evidence--and if\nthis evidence was material to the issue of MacDonald's guilt or innocence—a new trial should\ncertainly be granted.\n\nBut several problems remain: First, most Americans who have read the book or seen the TV\nmovie of Fatal Vision already \"know\" that Jeffrey MacDonald is guilty. They know it because the\nJeffrey MacDonald portrayed in those one-sided presentations was guilty. On TV, the actor, Gary\nCole, played him guilty. The evidence shown to the audience—like the evidence presented to the\nreal-life jury—did not include the physical evidence that corroborates the Stoeckley confessions.\nNor did it include the evidence that the prosecutor pressured Stoeckly to lie about her memory.\n\n198\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017285\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Speaking of 30 minutes, if you absolutely cannot stop a meeting or call from happening, define the end\ntime. Do not leave these discussions open-ended, and keep them short. If things are well-defined,\ndecisions should not take more than 30 minutes. Cite other commitments at odd times to make them more\nbelievable (e.g., 3:20 vs. 3:30) and force people to focus instead of socializing, commiserating, and\ndigressing. If you must join a meeting that is scheduled to last a long time or that is open-ended, inform\nthe organizer that you would like permission to cover your portion first, as you have a commitment in 15\nminutes. If you have to, feign an urgent phone call. Get the hell out of there and have someone else\nupdate you later. The other option is to be completely transparent and voice your opinion of how\nunnecessary the meeting is. If you choose this route, be prepared to face fire and offer alternatives.\n\n5. The cubicle is your temple—don’t permit casual visitors. Some suggest using a clear “do not disturb”\nsign of some type, but I have found that this is ignored unless you have an office. My approach was to\nput headphones on, even if I wasn’t listening to anything. If someone approached me despite this\ndiscouragement, I would pretend to be on the phone. I’d put a finger to my lips, say something like, “I\nhear you,” and then say into the mic, “Can you hold on a second?” Next, I’d turn to the invader and say,\n“Hi. What can I do for you?” I wouldn’t let them “get back to me” but rather force the person to give me\na five-second summary and then send me an e-mail if necessary.\n\nIf headphone games aren’t your thing, the reflexive response to an invader should be the same as when\nanswering the cell phone: “Hi, invader. I’m right in the middle of something. How can I be of help?” If\nit’s not clear within 30 seconds, ask the person to send you an e-mail about the chosen issue; do not offer\nto send them an e-mail first: “Il be happy to help, but I have to finish this first. Can you send me a\nquick e-mail to remind me?” If you still cannot deflect an invader, give the person a time limit on your\navailability, which can also be used for phone conversations: “OK, I only have two minutes before a call,\nbut what’s the situation and what can I do to help?”\n\n6. Use the Puppy Dog Close to help your superiors and others develop the no-meeting habit. The Puppy\nDog Close in sales is so named because it is based on the pet store sales approach: If someone likes a\npuppy but is hesitant to make the life-altering purchase, just offer to let them take the pup home and\nbring it back if they change their minds. Of course, the return seldom happens.\n\nThe Puppy Dog Close is invaluable whenever you face resistance to permanent changes. Get your foot\nin the door with a “let’s just try it once” reversible trial.\n\nCompare the following:\n\n“T think you’d love this puppy. It will forever add to your responsibilities until he dies 10 years from\nnow. No more care-free vacations, and you'll finally get to pick up poop all over the city— what do\nyou think?”\n\nVs.\nNow imagine walking up to your boss in the hallway and clapping a hand on her shoulder:\n“I'd like to go to the meeting, but I have a better idea. Let’s never have another one, since all we do is\nwaste time and not decide anything useful.”\n\nVS.\n\nThe second set of alternatives seem less permanent, and they’re intended to appear so.

Engineering (Homo)\nprodigies might make a small impact on this slow process, but speeding up development\nand implanting extensive memory (as DNA-exabytes or other means) could reduce\nduplication time of a bio-computer to close to the doubling time of cells (ranging from\neleven minutes to twenty-four hours). The point is that while we may not know what\nratio of bio/homo/nano/robo hybrids will be dominant at each step of our accelerating\nevolution, we can aim for high levels of humane, fair, and safe treatment (“use”) of one\nanother.\n\nBills of Rights date back to 1689 in England. FDR proclaimed the “Four\nFreedoms”’—freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom from fear, and freedom\nfrom want. The U.N.’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 included the\nright to life; the prohibition of slavery; defense of rights when violated; freedom of\nmovement; freedom of association, thought, conscience, and religion; social, economic,\nand cultural rights; duties of the individual to society; and prohibition of use of rights in\ncontravention of the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\n\nThe “universal” nature of these rights is not universally embraced and is subject\nto extensive critique and noncompliance. How does the emergence of non-Homo-\nintelligences affect this discussion? At a minimum, it is becoming rapidly difficult to\nhide behind vague intuition for ethical decisions—“I know it when I see it” (U.S.\nSupreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, 1964) or the “wisdom of repugnance” (aka “yuck\nfactor,” Leon Kass, 1997), or vague appeals to “common sense.” As we have to deal\nwith minds alien to us, sometimes quite literal from our viewpoint, we need to be\nexplicit—yea, even algorithmic.\n\nSelf-driving cars, drones, stock-market transactions, NSA searches, et cetera,\nrequire rapid, pre-approved decision making. We may gain insights into many aspects of\nethics that we have been trying to pin down and explain for centuries. The challenges\nhave included conflicting priorities, as well as engrained biological, sociological, and\nsemi-logical cognitive biases. Notably far from consensus in universal dogmas about\nhuman rights are notions of privacy and dignity, even though these influence many laws\nand guidelines.\n\nHumans might want the right to march in to read (and change) the minds of\ncomputers to see why they’re making decisions at odds with our (Homo) instincts. Is it\nnot fair for machines to ask the same of us? We note the growth of movements toward\ntransparency in potential financial conflicts; “open-source” software, hardware, and\nwetware; the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act (FASTR); and the\nOpen Humans Foundation.\n\nIn his 1976 book Computer Power and Human Reason, Joseph Weizenbaum\nargued that machines should not replace Homo in situations requiring respect, dignity, or\ncare, while others (author Pamela McCorduck and computer scientists like John\nMcCarthy and Bill Hibbard) replied that machines can be more impartial, calm, and\nconsistent and less abusive or mischievous than people in such positions.\n\nEquality\nWhat did the thirty-three-year-old Thomas Jefferson mean in 1776 when he wrote, “We\nhold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed\n\n169\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016389\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It was, in the White House staff’s bitter view, the media that turned every day into a\nclimactic, dastardly moment. And, in a sense, this was correct: every development cannot\nbe climactic. The fact that yesterday’s climax would soon, compared to the next climax, be\npiddling, rather bore out the disproportion. The media was failing to judge the relative\nimportance of Trump events: most Trump events came to naught (arguably all of them\ndid), and yet all were greeted with equal shock and horror. The White House staff believed\nthat the media’s Trump coverage lacked “context’”—by this, they meant that people ought\nto realize that Trump was mostly just huffing and puffing.\n\nAt the same time, few in the White House did not assign blame to Trump for this as\nwell. He seemed to lack the most basic understanding that a president’s words and actions\nwould, necessarily, be magnified to the nth power. In some convenient sense, he failed to\nunderstand this because he wanted the attention, no matter how often it disappointed him.\nBut he also wanted it because again and again the response surprised him—and, as though\nevery time was the first time, he could not modify his behavior.\n\nSean Spicer caught the brunt of the daily drama, turning this otherwise reasonable,\nmild-mannered, process-oriented professional into a joke figure standing at the White\nHouse door. In his daily out-of-body experience, as a witness to his own humiliation and\nloss for words, Spicer understood after a while—although he began to understand this\nbeginning his first day on the job when dealing with the dispute about the inaugural\naudience numbers—that he had “gone down a rabbit hole.” In this disorienting place, all\npublic artifice, pretense, proportion, savvy, and self-awareness had been cast off, or—\npossibly another result of Trump never really intending to be president—never really\nfigured into the state of being president.\n\nOn the other hand, constant hysteria did have one unintended political virtue. If every\nnew event canceled out every other event, like some wacky news-cycle pyramid scheme,\nthen you always survived another day.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nDonald Trump’s sons, Don Jr., thirty-nine, and Eric, thirty-three, existed in an enforced\ninfantile relationship to their father, a role that embarrassed them, but one that they also\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020074\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We hovered around unchanged for most of the day before selling off in the \nafternoon and testing 50$ BRE again. However, we failed to break it and rallied towards unchanged for the close, \nperhaps off the back of some index buying. Newswise, Feb Azeri BTC loadings will be up a whopping 11% m/o/m to \n821kbd. Interestingly, there is apparently some floating storage interest happening as well, as some major phys trading \nfirms have booked long term tankers for this as long term charter rates are cheaper and thus make the economics of \nstorage look good. The window was again weak with ekofisk and brent offered down a bit. In other news, RTRS cites GCC \n\"sources\" saying that there is no chance of OPEC cut even though oil has dipped to 50$...Stateside, we learned yesterday \nthat the Seaway Twin is moving 100% heavy crude. Furthermore, USGC diffs weakened again, with LLS now trading 1$ \nabove WTI. In the morning WTI spreads were quite bid, but that abated towards the end of the day. The arb did \nhowever stay bid throughout the day, as the fact that LLS/WTI is tight at 1$ means that there is more room BRE to \ndiscount vs LLS so as to place those Jan and Feb overhang cargoes in the US. In politics land, the Senate committee voted \n13-9 to have Keystone \"bypass\" presidential approval. So if the Senate passes this bill (which it should as it has 60 co \nsponsors), Obama may have to veto it. It is not clear that the Senate has 67 votes needed to overturn the veto, so this \nshould be interesting to follow...In products land, distillate bounced back a bit after yesterday's post stats ugly showing, \nperhaps off the realization that the stats didn't add up along with the extremely cold weather giving NG a (rare) bid as \nwell... \nOil Vols  \nAnother day of carnage in oil vols today. Early morning NY vols were down 0.4-0.5 through the curve, but a one way \nselling streak started just before the open and all the bids out there started getting hit. As an example Dec5 atm \nstraddles started the day 1465/1505, were 1405/1450 at 9am, and were 1350/1390 later in the day. Within 2 hours of \nopen, vols were down about 3 vols across the curve..and stayed there for most of the day till about 1:30pm when \nfutures took a quick leg lower., prompt vols traded 1.5% higher than close at that time and Jun5 was up 2% from the \nlows. However, with a quick rally back vols started fading again and ended 1.5-2.5 lower. \nWings got smashed again and put skew collapsed quickly. 8000 lots of $40puts in WTI Mar15 were sold on the screen, \nwhich is quite an impressive volume outside floor trading.. \nWTI (/change) \tBRE (/change) \nG15 \t50.40% \t-1.60% \t44.00% \t-2.60% \nH15 \t45.50% \t-2.40% \t43.70% \t-1.10% \nM15 \t41.40% \t-2.10% \t38.20% \t-2.60% \nZ15 \t35.15% \t-1.60% \t33.10% \t-2.15% \nZ16 \t28.60% \t-2.00% \t28.50% \t-1.80% \nIndex  \nNo rhyme or reason to flat price action today. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030856 \nEnergy up, precious down, ags down, softs up, base mixed. \nContributing to the choppy action was day one the SPGS and BCOM index rebalance and it was quite choppy during the \nclosing bell. \nEstimated rebalance numbers are next to today's performance grid.

Is there a way to\nspeed searching the maze, so you do not have to test every branch? If\nyou can provide a mathematical proof that there is or is not, you win the\nprize.\n\nPlaces Game\n\nWhile it is commonly assumed NP problems are the hardest, this is not\nthe case. There are quite a few that are harder still. One such is called a\nPSPACE problem. It’s quite difficult to explain but luckily many of you\nwill have played a form of it on long car trips when you were a child: My\nfamily calls it The Places Game.\n\nI will pick a place —- “London; and you must then pick another place,\nsay, ‘New York, that starts with the letter my place ends with. Pll then\npick ‘Canterbury’ and my kids will laugh at my dyslexia and I'll have to\nswitch to ‘Kansas’ and so on. Once you use a place you can’t use it again.\n\nThe mathematical question is to predict who will win given each\nplayer has a finite list of places they know? It turns out this type of\nproblem is even harder to solve than an NP problem. This is because\non each turn a player gets to pick any name from their list. With the\ntraveling salesman problem, there is only one ‘player’ — the salesman -\nso we can write out a route and check it. In the Places Game there is\nno single route through the game because, after I pick my favorite town\n‘London; you can pick any place beginning with ‘N’ I have to anticipate\nan enormous table of possible paths through the game. The table takes\nhuge physical space — which is where PSPACE gets its name.\n\nRemember I’m just playing the simplest mathematical games with\nbits of paper and discrete ideas. I haven't strayed into the quantum\nworld yet. That brings with it a whole new level of complexity to explore.\nComplexity is such a diverse subject that Scott Aaronson of MIT has\ncreated a web site called the complexity zoo to catalogue all the different\n‘species. It is much to complex to reproduce here but let me provide a\n\nsketch.\n\nThe Complexity Hierarchy\n\nMy table below represents the hierarchical complexity of knowledge.\nWe start off with the problems both humans and computers find easy,\nthen rapidly move onto problems that even the fastest machines find\ndifficult: a perfect game of chess or predicting the weather.

He was a Soviet Jew who I never even met during the years I was fighting\nto save his life. His name (at the time) was Anatoly Sharansky (now Natan Sharansky).\n\nSharansky was a prominent and vocal defender of human rights, not only of his fellow Soviet\nJews but of all victims of Soviet oppression. He worked closely with Andrei Saklarov, the father\nof the Soviet nuclear weapons program who had become the leading voice for human rights in the\nSoviet Union.\n\nSharansky was arrested by the Soviet KGB in 2003 [check] on charges of spying for the United\nStates—a charge that carried the death penalty. I had previously represented two Jewish\nRefusenicks who had tried to steal a small airplane in which to escape to Israel, via Sweden. They\nhad been sentenced to death, so I knew that the threat of capital punishment against Sharansky\nwas real. Their death sentences against were later reversed and they were eventually allowed to\nemigrate to Israel. But there was no assurance that similar efforts would help Sharansky, who\nfaced the more serious charge of spying for an enemy.\n\nI had been asked, along with Canadian law professor Irwin Cotler, to represent Sharanksy. The\nrequest came from his wife, who was in Israel, and his mother, who lived in Moscow. They had\nno money to pay for a lawyer. We agreed to do what we could to save his life and, hopefully,\nsecure his freedom.\n\nOur first job was to try to get the espionage charge dropped, since that was the one that carried\nthe death sentence. Because Sharanksy was accused of spying for the United States, I decided to\ngo directly to the White House to try to persuade President Carter to issue a statement expressly\ndenying the Soviet charge that Sharansky had been a CIA operative. We faced great pressure\nfrom the CIA to continue the longstanding American policy of never affirming or denying\nanyone’s alleged association with the agency. But after several requests, President Carter did\nissue the following statement:\n\nI have inquired deeply within the State Department and within the CIA, as to whether or\nnot Mr. Sharanksy has ever had any known relationship in a subversive way, or otherwise,\nwith the CIA. The answer is “no.” We have double-checked this, and I have been\nhesitant to make that public announcement, but now I am completely convinced.\n\nShortly after President Carter made his unprecedented statement, the Soviet prosecutors dropped\nthe espionage charge and took the death penalty off the table. But they were still determined to\nsee Sharansky die in prison. The Soviets called it “special regime” imprisonment, consisting of a\ndiet that no one could long survive. The prisoners called it “death on the installment plan.”\n\nSharansky’s wife pleaded with me to get him out of prison before he starved to death and before\n\nshe was too old to have children. We had saved him from execution; now we had to save him\nfrom starvation. We had our work cut out for us.\n\n204\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017291\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

As I would learn one stunning aspect after another, I would discuss them with friends and associates. Rather\nthan confront the facts I would present, they would find one clever way after another to avoid the frightening\ntruth of what America and the West truly face. Their fear appeared obvious to me. I began to catalog many of\nmy friends’ different maneuvers to dispel the anxiety that they found so difficult to endure. The more I focused\non their mental processes (as well as my own) the more I began to see a structure to the mental endeavor and to\nunderstand what I had, as a child, found so difficult to explain.\n\nFP: Tell us about the Control Factor, what you describe as “that effort our minds enga ge in in order to keep us\nblind” and that “process of a voiding seeing the threats we face.” It’s also about, as you state, trying to believe\nthat the threat is under our control, when in fact it is not. Kindly enlighten us as to these profound insights you\nmake in terms of the Control Factor.\n\nSiegel: First, let’s distinguish the ”real world” where real battles are taking place from the mental battlefield\nwhich occurs in each of our minds. We tend to believe our perceptions are simply clear realizations of what is\n“out there” and overlook how much our internal worlds can literally determine what we see. When our internal\nminds become anxious and sense a loss of “control,” they tend to concoct ways to distort our perceptions so as\nto restore that sense of inner control. I describe the Control Factor as an “active and continuous process”\ndesigned to maintain that sense, if not illusion, of control. We natural ly think that our thinking and feeling\nprocesses are passive; that they just happen. Yet when faced with truly frightening prospects, the mind is geared\nto actively distort.\n\nSimilarly, the sense of control must be continuously maintained so the Control Factor operates constantly. In\nturn, the sum of this active and continuous undertaking makes these perceptions all the more familiar and thus\nseemingly all the more “real.” In one sense, the Control Factor is the mechanism of what Andy McCarthy\nentitled one of his numerous excellent books- willful blindness. The Control Factor is cleverer than we are\naware; that is almost tautological as, if our minds are to create ways to keep us in denial, they must out\nmaneuver our conscious thinking.\n\nSince World War II, America has had limited experience with threats coming to the homeland. Most of\nAmerica’s history has been about “over there,” where we have always known that if things got too out of hand\n(e.g. Vietnam) we could always ret urn home. The current generations, for a wide array of reasons, have had\nvirtually no experience with a threat to this land. (The documentary, Generation Zero, is interesting on this\npoint).\n\nConsequently, the process of waking up to such a threat parallels the arc of a typical horror film. In such a film,\nthere is typically a cast of characters surrounding one or two main characters. We in the audience know there is\na threat coming — be it a monster, a virus, a psycho killer, an alien, the blob that ate Cincinnati etc. This threat is\ntypically defined by its intent- the singular goal of destroying the characters. Much of the initial exposition\nshows how the characters first are oblivious to the destruction the threat brings about, then explain it in familiar\nterms only to finally open their eyes to see that something uniquely terrifying is happening. The next stage\nusually involves a series of failed attempts to deal with the threat- fr om trying to negotiate with it, to appease it,\nto coax it, to threaten it with ineffective weapons and so forth. Most of these failings are due to not adequately\nappreciating the threat for what it truly is and projecting onto it a host of other attributes instead. The final stage\ngenerally involves a back-up-against-the-wall decision by whichever characters remain alive. I named this the\n“turnaround moment” when the character becomes willing to be as ruthless as the threat. That change in mental\nstate is necessary to ensure survival. Ultimately, the storyline is a race for whichever characters remain to wake\nup fully and use whatever advantages they may still have to beat the threat.\n\nThis is the same arc our minds go through in battling our own Control Factors, our own compulsions to deny\nthat which is staring us in the face. Ultimately, the question is whether we will be able to wake up while we still\nhave advantages and give ourselves permis sion to fully fight the battle we are in.\n\nI said ear lier that there is a structure to the Control Factor. To oversimplify, I view it much as a pyramid where\non the bottom are the many minute by minute thoughts that are manipulated. I call this level of maneuvers the\nmany ”D’s” as they include the psychological defenses such as distortion, denial, demonization, deflection,\ndeletion, detachment, delusion, displacement, discolorization and so forth. Layered upon these are moves such\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024385\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He developed the technique of\nrational meta-reasoning, “which is, roughly speaking, that you do the computations that\nyou expect to improve the quality of your ultimate decision as quickly as possible.” He\nhas also worked on the unification of probability theory and first-order logic—resulting\nin a new and far more effective monitoring system for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test\nBan Treaty—and on the problem of decision making over long timescales (his\npresentations on the latter topic are usually titled, “Life: Play and Win in 20 trillion\nmoves”’).\n\nHe is very concerned with the continuing development of autonomous weapons,\nsuch as lethal micro-drones, which are potentially scalable into weapons of mass\ndestruction.

It called for mental application, an ability to assess risks, to find\nanswers under enormous pressure when, inevitably, things went wrong. It\nrequired not just brawn, but brains.\n\nA week before I began my final year at Hebrew University, I went to see Eli\nZeira, the senior intelligence officer who’d so brashly predicted the course of\nthe Six-Day War, in hopes of sounding out my prospects of picking up my\nmilitary career where I'd left off. Despite a yawning gap in rank and age — Eli\nwas nearly fifteen years older — I felt I could be open with him. Not only did I\nknow him from Sayeret Matkal, which came under his purview in the kirya. He\nwas a scientist manqué and was eager, as soon as I arrived in his office, to hear\nabout my physics studies. When I did manage to turn the conversation to the\narmy, I told him I was thinking of returning after I graduated. Yet before finally\ndeciding, I wanted his honest opinion about my chances, at some point, of being\ngiven command of the sayeret. He began with a series of caveats. The choice of\nfuture leaders of the sayeret was not be his to make. When the current\ncommander, Uzi Yairi, ended his term in roughly 18 months’ time, Id still be\ntoo young to have a realistic chance. “Maybe even next time around,” he said.\nAnd in any case, I would first need to get some experience in the regular army.\n“But then,” he concluded, “my opinion is that you have a very good chance of\nbecoming commander of the unit.” That was more than enough. I figured that\nwhether it actually happened would now ultimately be down to me.\n\nMy last year at university was the closest thing I would have to a normal\nstudent existence. I was called away only once. But it was for a battle which\nwould turn out to have a lasting impact on the course of our conflict with the\nArabs, and on the prospects of eventually finding a way to make peace. It was\nIsrael’s largest military action since the war, across our new de facto border with\nJordan. And it was directed at a new enemy: a fledgling army of Palestinian\nfedayeen, called Fatah. It was led by a man that I, like almost all Israelis, had\nnever heard of at the time: Yasir Arafat. Born in Egypt, as a 19-year-old he had\nfought against the establishment of Israel in the 1948 war. Although Fatah had\nnominally existed for nearly a decade, it was only now emerging as a political\nforce, in large part because of the Arab armies’ humiliating defeat in the Six-\nDay War. A Palestinian political leadership already existed, in the shape of the\nPalestine Liberation Ogranization. But it was based in Cairo. Its chairman was,\nfor all practical purposes, an adjunct of President Nasser’s leadership role in the\nArab world. Though Arafat had not yet explicitly challenged this state of affairs,\nhis, and Fatah’s, rise after the war carried a powerful, message for the existing\nArab presidents and prime ministers: their brash promises of victory before the\n\n100\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011571\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He did mention, however, that elections would take\nplace in August, and that among the bills to be discussed would be a\nnew electoral law, a law allowing for the formation of political\nparties, a media law, a law to give greater powers to municipal\nauthorities, and the need to amend or even entirely rewrite the\nConstitution.

No doubt, the credits outweigh the debits in his\npersonal profit-and-loss account.

Frank Rosenblatt invented a learning\ndevice he called the perceptron, which was a one-layer neural network. In the late sixties,\nMarvin Minsky and Seymour Papert wrote a book titled Perceptrons, in which they\nbasically proved that perceptrons couldn’t do anything interesting, which is correct.\nPerceptrons could only make linear distinctions between things. So the idea was more or\nless dropped. People said, “These guys have written a proof that neural networks can’t\ndo anything interesting, therefore no neural networks can do anything interesting, so let’s\nforget about neural networks.” That attitude persisted for some time.\n\nMeanwhile, there were a couple of other approaches to AI. One was based on\nunderstanding, at a formal level, symbolically, how the world works; and the other was\nbased on doing statistics and probabilistic kinds of things. With regard to symbolic AI,\none of the test cases was, Can we teach a computer to do something like integrals? Can\nwe teach a computer to do calculus? There were tasks like machine translation, which\npeople thought would be a good example of what computers could do. The bottom line is\nthat by the early seventies, that approach had crashed.\n\nThen there was a trend toward devices called expert systems, which arose in the\nlate seventies and early eighties. The idea was to have a machine learn the rules that an\nexpert uses and thereby figure out what to do. That petered out. After that, AI became\nlittle more than a crazy pursuit.\n\nI had been interested in how you make an AJI-like machine since I was a kid. I was\ninterested particularly in how you take the knowledge we humans have accumulated in\nour civilization and automate answering questions on the basis of that knowledge. I\nthought about how you could do that symbolically, by building a system that could break\ndown questions into symbolic units and answer them. I worked on neural networks at\nthat time and didn’t make much progress, so I put it aside for a while.\n\nBack in mid-2002 to 2003, I thought about that question again: What does it take\nto make a computational knowledge system? The work I’d done by then pretty much\nshowed that my original belief about how to do this was completely wrong. My original\nbelief had been that in order to make a serious computational knowledge system, you first\nhad to build a brainlike device and then feed it knowledge—just as humans learn in\nstandard education. Now I realized that there wasn’t a bright line between what is\nintelligent and what is simply computational.\n\nI had assumed that there was some magic mechanism that made us vastly more\ncapable than anything that was just computational. But that assumption was wrong. This\ninsight is what led to Wolfram|Alpha. What I discovered is that you can take a large\ncollection of the world’s knowledge and automatically answer questions on the basis of\nit, using what are essentially merely computational techniques. It was an alternative way\nto do engineering—a way that’s much more analogous to what biology does in evolution.\n\nIn effect, what you normally do when you build a program 1s build it step-by-step.\nBut you can also explore the computational universe and mine technology from that\nuniverse. Typically, the challenge is the same as in physical mining: That is, you find a\nsupply of, let’s say, iron, or cobalt, or gadolinium, with some special magnetic properties,\n\n184\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016404\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Among them are the use of robotics in surgery, how\nnanotechnology may make us \"forever young,” applications of space\ntechnology in life sciences, and the “Moonshot” cancer program\ninitiated by former Vice President Joseph Biden.\nWithout doubt, global investors are closely watching organizations\nsuch as SALSS to discover the latest innovations and discoveries in life\nShutterstock\nscience. This area is replete with groups deeply involved in original\nresearch. So one of the major topics discussed at the SALSS conference\nwas “impact investing,” or why investors should pay closer attention to investing in life science.\n“In today’s world with an aging population, we observe a higher occurrence of chronic diseases, such as cancer and\nautoimmune conditions,” noted Hans Straberg, chairman of Atlas Copco, and former CEO of Electrolux. “So Big Pharma and\nthe industry are looking beyond the chemical and biologically derived molecules.” And as universities and small startups have\ntaken the lead in R&D investments, \"Big Pharma is very much dependent on collaborating with them, or acquiring their\ntechnologies,” he argued.\nToday Big Pharma has a “really strong position” in life sciences and are Looking for \"new blockbusters to replace current stars\nthat are coming off-patent,\" he said. The current focus, added Straberg, is “very much on finding cures for diseases like\ncancer, autoimmunity, allergy and infection,” and employing various new technologies.\nSo new ideas to address a variety of serious medical issues have always attracted medical luminaries to SALSS, and at this\nyear’s conference, the speakers included Biden Cancer Initiative Executive Director Gregory Simon, Nobel Foundation\nchairman Dr. Carl Henrik Heldin, European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Director-General Richard Bergstrom,\nand Microsoft Healthcare's chief development officer Mathias Ekman.\nAlso among the expert speakers were Pfizer executive vice president and chief of the company’s worldwide research\ndevelopment Dr. Michael Dolsten, Secretary-General of the Royal Swedish Academy Life Sciences' Dr. Goran Hansson,\nGoogle Healthcare and Cloud business manager Ebba Kraemer, China Kindstar Global Diagnostics CEO Shiang Huang,\nAVRA Medical Robotics founder and CEO Alen York, expert in diabetes-related issues and CEO of Lyfebulb Dr. Karin\nHehenberger, and the founder and former chairman of Human Genome Sciences and currently chairman of ACCESS Health\nInternational Dr. William A. Haseltine.\nRecommended by Forbes\n“Throughout the years, Swedish research and innovation have led the way to disruptive changes within medicine, which has\nresulted in an immense impact on people’s lives and great value for society,” argued Dr. Goran K. Hansson, secretary general\nof The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Today, “we see an increased interest of foreign capital in Swedish Life Science,\nwhich the Swedish government embraces,” he said. Swedish Life Science players, he added, \"look for international expansion\n1 of 2 9/13/2017, 8:01 PM\nSwedish American Group Focuses On Cancer, Autoimmune Diseases At...\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/genemarcial/2017/09/09/swedish-american...\n2 of 2 9/13/2017, 8:01 PM\n– especially within healthcare services.”\nOne of main focus of this year’s SALSS conference was the \"Cancer Moonshot,” which is now known as the Biden Cancer\nInitiative, represented by Gregory Simon, founder and executive director of The Biden Cancer Initiative.

Ehnbom, chairman and founder of SALSS. Also\nsignificant, she added, was the participation of numerous women at this year’s summit, led by the keynote speaker Dr. Bahija\nJallal, executive vice president at AsraZeneca and head of Medimmune. “ We are proud and glad that so many prominent\nwomen are actually SALSS women, including Dr. Jallal, which made this 2017 summit more exceptional,” said Ms. Ehnbom.\nOne of the little known companies that attracted a lot of attention at the conference was AVRA Medical Robotics, a\ndevelopment-stage company based in Orlando, Florida, that has a new generation of “semi-autonomous medical robots for\nimage-capture, navigation, and tissue targeting.”\nSpecifically, these “medical robots” perform computer-assisted surgery, with human medical surgeons operating a remote\nsurgical device via a console. In fact, they are not really robots as we know them: AVRA has developed a \"novel and truly\nrobotic single-arms platform for the field of aesthetics, skin and wound care as well as dermato-plastic surgery,” said Barry F.\nCohen, AVRA’s CEO and founder. The company’s first design integrates software, image guidance, navigation and targeting\nsystems, to allow autonomous needling of skin, he explained.\n“The future of surgery will be determined by success in gaining precision access to anny area of the human body with the\nsmallest incisions and deploying therapies to specific tissues, glands and organs,” asserted Alen York, an AVRA senior\nexecutive. Limitations in conventional surgeries, he said, are \"demanding more autonomous, intelligent robot systems that go\nbeyond the capability of a human being.” AVRA’S platform focused on needling technology \"represents a key breakthrough\nin aesthetics, wound care, and autonomous drug delivery platforms, integration of artificial intelligence and augmented\nreality that will allow,” says York, for a new paradigm in surgical training, planning and treatment.\nSmartwiseSweden AB is another young biotech that presened at SALSS. It has developed what it calls the Extroducer, a micro\ncatheter for injecting cells, biologics and small molecule therapy directly into organs. \"The tiny diameter of the Extroducer,\nwith the width of a hair, enables the needle to penetrate the blood vessel wall and deliver a payload via the smallest blood\nvessels in the body, making perviously inaccessible regions now available to direct tissue projection,” said Jonthan Clarke,\nCEO of Smartwise. Its product is the first of its kind of versatile device that allows for direct local injection of substances into\nmultiple organs, such as the heart, pancreas, liver and kidney.\n“We have shown successful and safe pre-clinical delivery of insulin producing cells into the pancreas and modified RNA to the\nheart,” said Clarke, who admitted that he is in talks with multiple major pharmaceutical companies for licensing or other\nagreements to advance production. Smartwise is still privately owned.\nProLung, a Salt Lake city-based biotechnology company focused singularly on improving lung cancer survival, has developed\na breakthrough test with precision volume-averaging “bioconductive technology\" to collect data to generate a personalized\nscore indicating the likelihood of malignancy. With an estimated one billion people at high-risk for lung cancer worldwide, it\nhas the lowest five-year survival rate, or 16%, of all major cancers, and is the leading cause of cancer death, said Steven C.\nEror, founder, president and CEO of ProLung. The copany's test is non-invasive and non-radiating that reduces the wait\ntime from months to just one day, he added.\nThe test has received a \"CE Mark and ISO 13485” manufacturing certificate and is approved for sale in the EEA and EFTA\ncountries, said Eror. In the U.S., the ProLung test is still for investigational use only and undergoing multi-site clinical trials\nfor FDA clearance as a “510(k) device,” he added.\nBecause the annual SALSS coference has attracted exerts worldwiude, it has become a central focus for life science companies\nto present and exhibit their new products or novel technology to a growing number of medical and scientific experts looking\nfor the next breakthrough product in life sciences.\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He warned for years that the\nbig tech companies were arrogant and clueless and less good for mankind than\nthey believed.\nComeuppance, the billionaire investor warned, was coming.\nTrouble has now arrived. Unfortunately for Mr. Thiel, the storm is centered on\nFacebook, whose board he has been a member of practically since its founding. The\nsocial network, which billed itself as bringing democracy and enlightenment to the\nworld, was used by the Russians to subvert democracy and sow confusion in the\nUnited States.\nEven people paid to see the future didn’t see that one coming.\n“The board’s role is to help think about some of the medium- and longer-term\nproblems coming around the corner,” Mr. Thiel said. “We were far from perfect in\ndoing that.”\nMr. Thiel, 50, is at the center of nearly every issue that roils Silicon Valley,\nranging from the tech elite’s fascination with New Zealand hideaways (Mr. Thiel\nobtained New Zealand citizenship) to Bitcoin (he is a major investor) to the\nproblems of herd thinking (he is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles to\nescape it) to the evolving role of content on the internet (he has been exploring the\ncreation of a media company that would outflank Breitbart and Fox for a younger\naudience).\nTwo subjects are currently overwhelming everything else: President Trump,\nwhom Mr. Thiel aggressively backed for president, and Facebook, whose core\nmission is being called into question in the wake of the Russian revelations. In a\ntypical Thiel move — he tends to run toward controversy even as his Silicon Valley\npeers try to make themselves inconspicuous — he agreed, in a rare interview, to\ntalk about both.\n“It’s been a crazier two years than I would have thought,” Mr. Thiel said in his new\nMidtown Manhattan apartment, which is so far up in the clouds that it literally\nlooks down on Trump Tower.\nDespite the proximity, the mutual enthusiasm between Mr. Thiel and Mr.\nTrump seems to have cooled. After Mr. Thiel spoke at the Republican National\nConvention in 2016, there were unsourced media reports that said Mr. Trump\nwanted to put him on the Supreme Court. But now even photo ops are rare.\nThe investor said he had last spoken to the president “a few months ago.”\n“We don’t talk that often,” he said, but added, “I can get access anytime I\nwant.”\nThe Trump whom Mr. Thiel touted at the Republican convention was a\ncandidate who would “end the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country,” move\nus past “fake culture wars” and start projects the equivalent of the Apollo space\nprogram. That does not seem to be the president he got.\n“There are all these ways that things have fallen short,” Mr. Thiel said. But he\nsaid he had no regrets about his endorsement. “It’s still better than Hillary Clinton\nor the Republican zombies,” he said, referring to the other candidates.\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\nMr. Thiel is routinely labeled a libertarian. On a bookshelf in the apartment, as\nif in confirmation, is a hardback copy of Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged,” the bible of\nthe movement. A gift, he said.\nA lesser-known but possibly deeper influence was the French philosopher\nRené Girard, who taught at Stanford University when Mr. Thiel was an\nundergraduate there. For 15 years, on and off, Mr. Thiel sat in on a study group\nabout Mr. Girard’s ideas. Mr. Girard believed human beings were deeply mimetic,\nwhich is to say they copy one another.\n“It’s very anti-Ayn Rand: There are no self-contained autonomous figures,”\nMr. Thiel said. “Our desires are not our own. They get shaped powerfully by the\nsociety around us.”\nIt was this illumination that helped him see the potential of Facebook — where\npeople could find out in intimate and addictive detail what their friends were up to\n— when it was barely a year old. He was the first outside investor, buying 10\npercent of the company for $500,000.\nHe sold most of his holdings in 2012 as Facebook went public. A few months\nago, with Facebook’s market capitalization at about $500 billion, he sold most of\nwhat he had left.\nLast summer, there was a flap when a memo by a fellow board member, Reed\nHastings, the chief executive of Netflix, appeared in The New York Times. In the\nmemo, Mr. Hastings wrote to Mr. Thiel that he displayed “catastrophically bad\njudgment” in supporting Mr. Trump.\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, did not ask him to step down\nfrom the board, and reports that he wants to leave the board are incorrect, Mr.\nThiel said, noting that among other things that he brings “ideological diversity.” He\ndeclined to say exactly how much or what kind of advice the Facebook board was\noffering Mr. Zuckerberg, but defended the company from criticism that it was slow\nto wake up to what the Russians did.\n“Remember when Trump said the election was going to be rigged? People said\nthat was crazy — ‘How dare you question the integrity of the electoral process?’\nThat was the view of most of the people working at Facebook, too,” he said. “They\ndid not think things were so hackable. It was a mistake, but an understandable\nmistake.” Facebook declined to comment.\nThe anger now being turned on Facebook, Mr. Thiel argued, is less about\nRussia specifically and more about tech arrogance — its failure to do so much for\nso many. It is a sentiment that helped put Mr. Trump in the White House.\n“The Trump campaign slogan, ‘Make America Great Again,’ was perhaps the\nsingle most offensive thing you could say to Silicon Valley,” he said. “Silicon Valley\nsays the future is going to be better than the past. That is the propaganda, if you\nwill.”\nA friend of his in Silicon Valley had the idea of running for governor of\nCalifornia this year. Mr. Thiel’s advice was that he had better have a good answer\nto this question: Why is tech good for the average person in California? The\nanswer, he cautioned, couldn’t be a banality, such as “it’s making us more\nconnected,” and it couldn’t be utopian, such as “it’s going to cure all diseases.”\n“He wasn’t able to come up with an answer, and I couldn’t come up with one,\neither,” Mr. Thiel said. He declined to identify the friend, but it is well known in\ntech circles that Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, the prominent startup\naccelerator, was thinking about running. Mr. Altman confirmed it was him and\nsaid he had decided not to run “for many reasons.”\nThere is a big painting of a cresting wave in Mr. Thiel’s living room, and it\nmight as well be a visual metaphor for what is going on in big tech now.\n“Having some ambition that transcends just making money is a critical thing\nfor a company,” he said. “But there is some point where it gets crazy and selfdelusional.”\nHe added that the companies “are probably in some trouble — maybe\nit’s a little, maybe it’s a lot.” The prospect of government regulation looms.\nIn 2015 and 2016, Mr. Thiel gave $300,000 to Josh Hawley, who was\ncampaigning to become Missouri’s attorney general. Mr. Hawley won, and in\nNovember he opened an antitrust investigation of Google. A spokeswoman for Mr.\nHawley, a Republican who is now challenging the state’s Democratic senator,\nClaire McCaskill, said there was “no connection” between Mr. Thiel’s donation and\nthe investigation. Google declined to comment.\nThe news last month that Mr. Thiel is moving from San Francisco to Los\nAngeles reflects a shift that is as much mental as literal. Getting out of the tech\nbubble, he figures, will give him more clarity about his investments.\n“Network effects are very positive things, but there’s a tipping point where\nthey fall over into the madness of crowds,” he said.\nAnother of Mr. Thiel’s contentious ideas was destroying Gawker, the online\npublisher. He secretly financed the privacy lawsuit that Hulk Hogan, the former\npro wrestler, filed against the media company, which Mr. Hogan won. That led to\nGawker’s bankruptcy in 2016.\nA news operation that specialized in deflating the arrogance of Silicon Valley\nshould have been to Mr. Thiel’s liking. But he argues that his philosophy is\nconsistent here.\n“Gawker was trying to cut people down to size for not conforming,” he said.\n“The ability to speak and not have every word you say get distorted, to have wrong\nideas and then be able to correct them — these notions were powerfully undercut\nby Gawker.”\nMr. Thiel is still pursuing the remnants of Gawker in court, which has\nprompted accusations that he wants to remove all of its content from the internet\nas a final victory.\nHe denied this. “Terry Bollea, a.k.a. Hulk Hogan, is still owed some money\nfrom the Gawker sale, and that is what I am trying to get,” he said. “I don’t want\nthe archives. I don’t think it makes sense to destroy them.

Article 2.1 of that Convention states:\n\nAny person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that person by any means,\ndirectly or indirectly, unlawfully and willfully, provides or collects funds with the intention that they\nshould be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out: (a) An act which constitutes an offence within the\nscope of and as defined in one of the treaties listed in the annex;' or (b) Any other act intended to cause\ndeath or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the\nhostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to\nintimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain\nfrom doing any act.\n\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (Dec. 9, 1999) (1999 Financing Terrorism\nConvention), 2178 U.N.T.S. 197. The 1999 Financing Terrorism Convention was signed by at least 39 nations *128 before\nSeptember 11, 2011, entered into force on April 10, 2002, and now has 132 signatories and 174 parties. See United States v.\nBahlul, No. 09-001, 2011 U.S. CMCR LEXIS 3, at *126-27 (CMCR Sept. 9, 2011).\n\nMost of the regional and multilateral conventions regarding terrorism employ a similar definition. See Interlocutory Decision\non the Applicable Law: Terrorism, Conspiracy, Homicide, Perpetration, Cumulative Charges (Applicable Law for Special\nTribunal for Lebanon), 50 I.L.M. 513, 536 (Spec. Trib. For Leb. July 2011) (discussing conventions). In addition, “all of\nthese conventions require--through the definition of the actus reus (the material element of a crime) or by additional\nprovisions--a transnational element to the crime.” Id. These international treaties and conventions support the conclusion that\n“conduct in support of terrorism [is] internationally condemned and criminal.” United States v. Hamdan, 801 F. Supp. 2d\n1247, 1284 (CMCR 2011).\n\n3. Domestic laws of nations\n\nCountries throughout the world have adopted a similar definition of terrorism in their domestic law (although in some cases\nthe domestic definition is broader than the definition in the international conventions because it does not include the\ntransnational element). See, e.g., Applicable *129 Law for Special Tribunal for Lebanon, 50 I.L.M. at *537-39; Bahlul, 2011\nU.S. CMCR Lexis 3, at *138-148. For these reasons, at least one international court has found that there is a general opinion\nand practice such that international terrorism is a violation of customary international law. See Applicable Law for Special\nTribunal for Lebanon, 50 1.L.M. at *535; Hamdan, 801 F. Supp. 2d at 1288-92.\n\nWESTLAW\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023401\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

They call into question the true independence\nof the boards of Korean conglomerates and the ability of outside\ndirectors to effectively oversee management and protect all\nshareholders’ interests.\n\nRecent research on Korean-listed companies shows strong\nsocial ties between independent directors and management of\nKorean conglomerates. While 87% of boards are in theory\nindependent, only 62% are when one considers social ties.* The\ncomposition of Korean boards also poses concern as the\npercentage of directors with business or management\nbackgrounds has decreased from 45.2% in 2004 to 28.4% in\n2011.° This, while the number of former public officials has\nsharply increased from 2.7% in 2004 to 8.9% in 2011.\nInterestingly, in Korea's boardrooms, the inclusion of professors\nand lawyers as independent directors has become common. The\nneed for stronger\nindependent oversight\nand monitoring of\nmanagement is especially\nimportant for Korean\nchaebols as they\nconcentrate the\nmanagerial power into\nthe board’s chairman, a\nmember of the founding\nfamily. The chairman’s\ncontrol over all\nsubsidiaries of the\nconglomerate through\nthe management council and appointment of management of\nall affiliated firms has been a serious concern for minority\nshareholders seeking more accountability and managerial\ntransparency.\n\nProtecting Shareholder Interests\n\nAt the core of Korea’s governance challenges lies a structural\nproblem at the chaebol: the complex system of cross-\nshareholdings. On average, the founding family of Korean\nconglomerates owns about 10% of the parent company’s shares,\nwhile other listed subsidiaries own more than 30%.!° The\nfounding family is a shareholder in the other chaebol\nsubsidiaries, and the subsidiaries reciprocate by owning shares\nin the other companies. The circular ownership structure has\nbeen of investor concern as it provides a framework for related\nparty transactions and potential conflict between family\nshareholders and external shareholders. For many, these\nconcerns have been factored into what has been called for over\na decade the “Korean discount.”\n\nWith the promise of sweeping governance reform by the new\nPresident Moon Jae-In, foreign investors are looking today for\nbetter protection of minority shareholder rights and stronger\nconstraints on chaebol businesses. On the politico-economic\nreform agenda are topics such as: 1) reforming the Korean\nCommercial Code by mandating separate elections for audit\n\n“With the adoption of a Stewardship Code,\nour expectations are that shareholders in\nKorean equities, and especially in chaebols,\nwill use their voice more actively to\npromote positive governance change and\nlong-term shareholder value creation.”\n\ncommittee members, 2) allowing shareholders of parent\ncompanies to sue directors of subsidiary firms, 3) lowering\neligibility thresholds for filing representative lawsuits, 4)\nregulating compensation for controlling shareholders and\nmanagement, as well as 5) introducing mandatory electronic\nand cumulative voting.!!\n\nOne of the most ambitious goals includes proposed amendments\nto Korea’s Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act, introducing\nconstraints on chaebol businesses and banning all existing\ncircular ownership structures of chaebols within three years.”\n\nThe calls for big governance reform in Korea were first publicly\nvoiced by chaebols’ shareholders themselves. In 2015, at\nHyundai Motor’s annual general meeting, shareholders openly\nconfronted management about the controversial land deal and\nproposed a new governance committee to strengthen oversight\nand accountability. In an unprecedented fashion, their\nshareholder action\nprompted the company\nto set up a separate\nCorporate Governance\nand Communication\nCommittee consisting\nof four independent\ndirectors, and to engage\nin shareholder outreach.\nIn 2016, Hyundai Motor\nofficially announced its\nnew “Corporate\nGovernance Charter” in\nan effort to enhance\ntransparent business management and to promote shareholder\nrights.!° Similarly, in November 2016, Samsung announced a\n“Comprehensive Roadmap to Enhance Long-term Shareholder\nValue Creation,” committing to improve governance by\nincreasing its board’s independence, as well as the diversity and\nbreadth of experience of its directors.\n\nChanging Korea’s Business Culture\n\nThe expected governance reform in Korea is an opportunity not\nonly to disentangle politics from business, but also to create\nbetter institutional protection for all shareholders. It also serves\nas an opportunity to change the culture of investing in the\ncountry.\n\nIn February, Korea's Financial Services Commission introduced\nthe country’s first Stewardship Code, encouraging big investors\nlike pension plans and asset managers to actively engage with\ninvestee companies and to monitor their management decisions.\nThis trend towards investor stewardship and active ownership\nechoes the progress already made in other Asian markets such\nas Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and\nThailand. With the adoption of a Stewardship Code, our\nexpectations are that shareholders in Korean equities, and\nespecially in chaebols, will use their voice more actively to\npromote positive governance change and long-term shareholder\nvalue creation. @\n\nGLOBAL FORESIGHT THIRD QUARTER 2017\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012093\n\n15\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He is the author of The Control Factor: Our Struggle to See the True Threat.\n\nFP: Bill Siegel, welcome to FrontPage Interview.\nCongratulations on this brilliant book. It is without question one of the most vital works of our time.\nLet’s begin with what inspired you to write it.\n\nSiegel: Thanks for having me Jamie. As a young boy born in the mid 1950s, I was fascinated with footage of\nHitler and the Third Reich and could never understand how the Jews of the time could not see the evil that\nseemed so obvious. Not yet appreciative of the benefit of hindsight, I could not comprehend the blindness.\nFollowing 9/11, like so many others, I began to study Islam, its history, its current movements, terrorism and\nso on. As I would learn one stunning aspect after another, I would discuss them with friends and associates.\nRather than confront the facts I would present, they would find one clever way after another to avoid the\nfrightening truth of what America and the West truly face. Their fear appeared obvious to me. I began to\ncatalog many of my friends’ different maneuvers to dispel the anxiety that they found so difficult to endure.\nThe more I focused on their mental processes (as well as my own) the more I began to see a structure to the\nmental endeavor and to understand what I had, as a child, found so difficult to explain.\n\nFP: Tell us about the Control Factor, what you describe as “that effort our minds enga ge in in order to keep\nus blind” and that “process of a voiding seeing the threats we face.” It’s also about, as you state, trying to\nbelieve that the threat is under our control, when in fact it is not. Kindly enlighten us as to these profound\ninsights you make in terms of the Control Factor.\n\nSiegel: First, let’s distinguish the ”real world” where real battles are taking place from the mental battlefield\nwhich occurs in each of our minds. We tend to believe our perceptions are simply clear realizations of what is\n“out there” and overlook how much our internal worlds can literally determine what we see. When our\ninternal minds become anxious and sense a loss of “control,” they tend to concoct ways to distort our\nperceptions so as to restore that sense of inner control. I describe the Control Factor as an “active and\ncontinuous process” designed to maintain that sense, if not illusion, of control. We natural ly think that our\nthinking and feeling processes are passive; that they just happen. Yet when faced with truly frightening\nprospects, the mind is geared to actively distort.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024408\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We must learn all we can about the\nenemy. We must unwind our inappropriate projections and introjections and rediscover who we are and are\nnot. We must speak up. We must support those Muslims who promote expressions of Islam that are\nconsistent with our principles. And we must stalk the C ontrol Factor, constantly be on guard for its\nintrusion. This is an individual endeavor as each of our Control Factors uses its own methods. The book\ngives plenty of examples of each maneuver discussed but it is important for each of us to discover the\nunique workings of his own mind. That takes the work of the Inner Jihad.\n\nFP: Share with our readers what you mean by the “Turnaround Moment.”\n\nSiegel: There is a moment in typical horror films where the central characters have been pushed to their\nlimit. They then change and fully embrace the willingness to be as ruthless as the threat they face. No more\nmoral high ground; no more futile attempts to ignore or change the threat’s essence. As Lee Harris\ndescribed in The Suicide of Reason, it is the willingness o r license to be (not necessarily actually being) as\nruthless that is critical. It is a mental state that sheds all the prior counter-productive efforts at denial to\nfinally clearly focus on the threat faced. Part of the Inner Jihad is to reach that Turnaround Moment sooner\nrather than later.\n\nFP: You suggest that “mirroring” should be used as part of our arsenal. Tell us about it.\n\nSiegel: Mirroring is a literal approach to transferring back to the addict responsibility that we have been\ninappropriately accepting. Critical to the addict/enabler relationship is asymmetry. Like the addict, the\nenemy uses a less limiting set of rules than we do. The enemy typically initiates aggression while we\nrespond only. Mirroring means that we demonstrate our willingness to act symmetrically, to be governed by\nthe same rules. It is stunning how much is accomplished when one’s attitude simply is clear that he will do\nwhat is necessary; often not much else is needed as the addict or enemy realizes the game is fundamentally\nchanged. But other times action is absolutely needed. Demonstrating that we are not afraid to treat the\nenemy as it treats us carries great meaning. Imagine (international law aside) if Israel announced that from\nnow on it will mirror Hamas such that if civilian populations are targeted by bombs from Gaza, Israel will\ndo the same (it is accused of such anyway). The population might finally rethink and take responsibility for\nits privilege of voting its leaders. As stated earlier, all behavior is instructive and when we mirror we teach\nthe other the effects of his behavior.\n\nConversely, some situations demand that we assert asymmetry; those cases where it is necessary to\nhighlight our differences with the enemy. Just this week, an disingenuous report was issued by an NGO\ndrawing an equivalence between Palestinian and Israe li schoolbooks claiming that both sides have their\nrelativistic “ narratives.” Yet, as the Palestinian Media Watch’s website has demonstrated for years, there is\nnothing in the West anywhere comparable to the hatred spewed daily by the Palestinian Authority,\nincluding through its education system. It is interesting to note that while the US State Department initially\nfunded the “study,”- in what appears to be an attempt to sanitize the PA’s record so that the US can\ncontinue to fund the PA against the spirit of US law- Hillary Clinton has a difficult time escaping her\nconclusion as Senator in 2007 that these schoolbooks along with other media “profoundly poison(s) the\nminds of these children.” It is most important that we do not succumb to this type of use of symmetry that\ndistorts the profound differences between us and the enemy.\n\nEssentially, we are not clear as a nation, participating in a world with international rules, how to bes t fight\nthis enemy. The first act of any rehab is to acknowledge that we do not know how nor are we yet competent\nto stop our addictions. This is not a book about policy. In fact, the “right” policies are unlikely to emerge\nuntil a critical mass has meaningfully dealt with their Control Factors and share a common perspective. We\nlike to look at our history and assume a single perspective throughout but the truth is that we had to learn\nhow to respond to Pearl Harbor, the Nazis, the Cold War etc. The same applies here. Our press promotes\n“elites” who are tasked with acting as if they possess the “true wisdom” to deal with our threats but the truth\nis we do not know nor are we equipped to marshal enough of our population to agree just yet. The sooner\nwe learn, however, the less we will suffer. Mirroring has always been a key component of those lessons.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025035\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But far from showing\n\nits age, the US economy begins 2017 at an above-\ntrend growth pace, with little evidence of cyclical\nimbalances or other excesses that typically portend\nthe end of the business cycle. If anything, the slow\npace of this recovery has elongated its life span, a\ndynamic that is likely to persist this year. Perhaps\nin macroeconomics, as in life, age is just a number.\n\nEurozone: Weathering the Storm\nThe Eurozone has faced its share of challenges in\n\nrecent years. Not only did it relapse into recession\nin 2011, but it also endured a domestic sovereign\n\nbond and banking crisis at the same time. More\nrecently, it has been buffeted by a spate of tragic\nterrorist attacks, an immigration crisis, the Brexit\nvote, a failed Italian constitutional referendum\nand renewed concerns about the solvency of its\nbanking system.\n\nYet despite this onslaught of headwinds, the\nreal economy has been remarkably stable in the\nlast two years. That fact is evident in Exhibit 40,\nwhich shows real GDP growth has sustained an\nabove-trend pace over this period, an outcome\nthat clearly exceeded consensus forecasts. Business\nsentiment has remained equally steadfast over this\nperiod, suggesting that the rapidity of shocks may\nhave effectively inured confidence to bad news (see\nExhibit 41). Meanwhile, real household disposable\nincome grew by 2.3% over the past year—the\nfastest pace since 2007.\n\nWe expect this stability to persist in 2017,\nwith our forecast calling for 1.2-1.9% real GDP\ngrowth. Keep in mind that there is ample scope\nfor above-trend growth to continue, as the level\nof Eurozone GDP still stands below its potential.\nOn this point, the OECD, IMF and European\nCommission each currently estimate an output gap\nof around 2%, indicating slack in the economy.\nThe Eurozone’s still elevated 9.8% unemployment\nrate corroborates this point.\n\n42 | Goldman Sachs | JANUARY 2017\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014575\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The con-\nfrontation left everybody shaken, with Trump asking Lewandowski not\nto tell anyone, and Lewandowski, when talking to the people he did tell,\nsaying that he had almost wet himself.\n\nBy March, Trump and Kelly were hardly speaking. Trump ignored\nhim; Kelly sulked. Or Trump would drop pointed hints that Kelly should\nresign, and Kelly would ignore him.

Cohen, who billed him-\nself as Trump’s personal lawyer, sat handcuffed for hours in his kitchen\nwhile the FBI conducted its search, itemizing and hauling away every\nelectronic device its agents could find,\n\nBannon, coincidentally, also stayed at the Regency on his frequent\ntrips to New York, and he would sometimes bump into Cohen in the\nhotel’s lobby. Bannon had known Cohen during the campaign, and the\nlawyer's mysterious involvement in campaign issues often worried him.\nNow, in Washington, seeing the Cohen news, Bannon knew that another\ncrucial domino had fallen.\n\n“While we don’t know where the end is,” said Bannon, “we can guess\nwhere it might begin: with Brother Cohen”\n\n+\n\nOn April 11, three weeks after the president signed the budget bill, Paul\nRyan—one of the government's most powerful figures given the red\nlican lock on Washington—announced his plan to leave the Speakership\nand depart Congress.\n\n“Listen to what Paul Ryan is saying,” said Bannon, sitting at his table\nin the Embassy early that morning. “It’s over. Done. Done. And Paul Ryan\nwants the fuck off the Trump train today:”\n\nRyan had been telling almost anyone who would listen that as id\nas fifty or sixty House seats would be lost seven months hence in the mid-\nterm elections. A Ryan lieutenant, Steve Stivers, chairman of the National\nRepublican Congressional Committee, was estimating a loss of ninety to\none hundred seats.

I felt\nresentful for years.\n\nI didn't even tell my partners about my orgasm difficulties until I'd known them for a\nwhile, because my secret felt like such Restricted Information: I couldn't give it to anyone\nI didn't trust. I couldn't abide the idea of \"everyone knowing\" how broken I felt. I couldn't\nstand the combination of pity and fascination that my problem evoked in the few who\nknew.\n\nWhen I did get around to telling my partners, that was most complicated of all. I was\nquite unpopular in high school, and so I was something of a late bloomer -- boyfriend-\nfree until my late teens. It took years before I had any confidence in my boyfriend\ninteractions. And because I had no idea how to come and no idea where to start and little\nidea of how to communicate about sex, I could not give guidance about what I wanted.\n\nI also felt paranoid that lovers would resent me if they felt I was demanding something\ntoo \"difficult\" during the sexual \"exchange,\" so I downplayed my feelings. I told awful\nlies like “it's not a big deal that I can't come\" -- lies that broke my heart as I spoke them,\nbut felt safer than the truth.\n\nI did manage to have one orgasm in my teens -- one. I'm still not sure how it happened. It\noccurred one evening when I was incredibly tired, but went out with friends to get a\nfudge brownie sundae anyway. When I got back, my boyfriend came over and wanted to\nhave sex, and I let it happen -- despite being tired and uninterested and full of sundae --\nbecause I had not yet internalized the notion that my boyfriends wouldn't hate me if I\ndenied them sex. I was barely present during the act, but I jolted into awareness when I\nrealized I was having an orgasm. Afterwards, exhaustion overwhelmed me and I fell\nstraight into sleep -- so deep that my boyfriend was unable to wake me.\n\nThis was puzzling and hard to analyze. What aspects of my singular orgasm should go\ninto my Unified Theory... and which aspects were irrelevant?\n\nThe chocolate? Well, chocolate is arguably a mild drug, and drugs help some people\ncome. Also, there were studies that found mild aphrodisiac qualities to chocolate. So\nmaybe.\n\nThe position? The position had felt really good but was somewhat awkward, and I felt\nweird asking my boyfriend to reproduce it, so I didn't let myself think about the position.\n(I'm much better at communicating with my partners now.)\n\nWhat about the exhaustion? It made sense that being very tired might help me \"let go.\"\nBut I hadn't been very turned on or enjoyed the rest of the encounter, mostly because I\nwas so exhausted; and I didn't want to deliberately force myself to have sex while tired.\nSo while the exhaustion might have been a factor, I filed it under \"less-than-useful\" as\nwell.\n\nI didn't worry about the problem too much for a while, because I figured that now that I'd\nhad one orgasm, surely it would become easy.

When\nthe program saw a particular character, it could infer the sequence of strokes that were\nmost likely to have led to it—just as I inferred that the spam process led to my dubious\nemail. Then it could judge whether a new character was likely to result from that\nsequence or from a different one, and it could produce a similar set of strokes itself. The\nprogram worked much better than a deep-learning program applied to exactly the same\ndata, and it closely mirrored the performance of human beings.\n\nThese two approaches to machine learning have complementary strengths and\nweaknesses. In the bottom-up approach, the program doesn’t need much knowledge to\nbegin with, but it needs a great deal of data, and it can generalize only in a limited way.\nIn the top-down approach, the program can learn from just a few examples and make\nmuch broader and more varied generalizations, but you need to build much more into it to\nbegin with. A number of investigators are currently trying to combine the two\napproaches, using deep learning to implement Bayesian inference.\n\nThe recent success of AI 1s partly the result of extensions of those old ideas. But\nit has more to do with the fact that, thanks to the Internet, we have much more data, and\nthanks to Moore’s Law we have much more computational power to apply to that data.\nMoreover, an unappreciated fact is that the data we do have has already been sorted and\nprocessed by human beings. The cat pictures posted to the Web are canonical cat\npictures—pictures that humans have already chosen as “good” pictures. Google\nTranslate works because it takes advantage of millions of human translations and\ngeneralizes them to a new piece of text, rather than genuinely understanding the\nsentences themselves.\n\nBut the truly remarkable thing about human children is that they somehow\ncombine the best features of each approach and then go way beyond them. Over the past\nfifteen years, developmentalists have been exploring the way children learn structure\nfrom data. Four-year-olds can learn by taking just one or two examples of data, as a top-\ndown system does, and generalizing to very different concepts. But they can also learn\nnew concepts and models from the data itself, as a bottom-up system does.\n\nFor example, in our lab we give young children a “blicket detector”’—a new\nmachine to figure out, one they’ve never seen before. It’s a box that lights up and plays\nmusic when you put certain objects on it but not others. We give children just one or two\nexamples of how the machine works, showing them that, say, two red blocks make it go,\nwhile a green-and-yellow combination doesn’t. Even eighteen-month-olds immediately\nfigure out the general principle that the two objects have to be the same to make it go,\nand they generalize that principle to new examples: For instance, they will choose two\nobjects that have the same shape to make the machine work. In other experiments, we’ve\nshown that children can even figure out that some hidden invisible property makes the\nmachine go, or that the machine works on some abstract logical principle.**\n\n38 A.

The September 11th Attacks\nwere the culmination of a campaign to wage jihad against the United States, set in motion with the formation of al-Qaeda in\n1988 and made possible by the massive financial, logistic, and material support provided to al-Qaeda by its collaborators and\n*9 sympathizers over a period of many years. That support allowed al-Qaeda to build the global infrastructure necessary to\nplan and conduct the September 11th Attacks.\n\nThrough their suits, plaintiffs seek to hold accountable the states, purported charities, banks, organizations and individuals\nwho knowingly provided material support or resources to al-Qaeda, thereby making the September 11th Attacks possible.\nPlaintiffs’ complaints assert claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act, Alien Tort Statute, Torture Victim Protection Act, and\ncommon law theories of concerted action liability. Plaintiffs initiated their respective actions between August 15, 2002 and\nSeptember 2, 2004.\n\nIn presenting their substantive claims and theories of jurisdiction against the defendants, and in responding to the various\nmotions to dismiss, plaintiffs offered detailed factual allegations in their respective complaints concerning the origins of\nal-Qaeda, the vast infrastructure that fueled that organization’s growth and development, and al-Qaeda’s systematic and\npublic targeting of the United States and its citizens beginning in 1988. JA3775-78.4 Within this broader framework, the *10\npleadings described the particular character of the defendants’ collaboration with al-Qaeda, and the nature of the material\nsupport and resources they provided to al-Qaeda in furtherance of its jihad against the United States. JA3602-3728,\n3778-3876.\n\nPlaintiffs in virtually all cases later filed one or more amended complaints, and numerous RICO Statements and/or More\nDefinite Statements as to individual defendants, which served to amend their respective complaints.’ Those supplemental\npleadings offered additional details concerning the individual defendants’ roles in supporting al-Qaeda, based largely on the\nflow of new evidence and information uncovered as a result of the intensive investigations initiated following the September\n11th Attacks concerning the sources of al-Qaeda’s vast financial and logistical support.\n\nOn December 9, 2003, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring the Burnett action from the\nDistrict of Columbia to the Southern District of New York and consolidating all then-indicated, citations to the record refer to\nthe docket numbers on the MDL 1570 docket sheet. *11 pending cases against al-Qaeda’s material sponsors and supporters\narising from the September 11th Attacks. The September 11th MDL was assigned to Judge Richard Casey, who presided\nover the consolidated proceedings until his death on March 22, 2007. On April 20, 2007, the September 11th MDL was\nre-assigned to Judge George Daniels, who has since presided over the trial court proceedings.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2005, approximately 100 defendants entered appearances in the cases comprising the September 11th\nMDL and, with one exception, moved to dismiss the claims against them. In general terms, the defendants’ motions sought\ndismissal principally under one or more of the following theories: (1) lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the Foreign\nSovereign Immunities Act (FSIA); (2) lack of personal jurisdiction; and/or (3) failure to state a claim.\n\nIn response to defendants’ motions seeking dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction and/or subject matter jurisdiction and\nunder the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), plaintiffs supplemented their already detailed allegations record\nrelevant to those jurisdictional disputes through extrinsic information and evidence filed in support of their oppositions to the\nDefendants’ motions to dismiss.

Assad has not yet fallen. The Iranian nuclear programme\nis proceeding apace. Tehran's Hezbollah client is in effective control\nof Lebanon. But it does mean that in future the Iranian appeal is\nlikely to be more decisively limited to areas of Shia population.\n\nThe less good news, from Israel's point of view, is that the new forces\non the rise in the region consist largely of one or another variant of\nSunni Islamism. AKP-led Turkey has emerged as a key facilitator of\nthe Syrian opposition, in which Sunni Islamist elements play a\nprominent role. Turkey appears to be in the process of making a bid\nfor the regional leadership also sought by Iran. In Egypt, too, the\nMuslim Brotherhood and other Islamist forces look set to reap an\nelectoral dividend in November. The Sinai area has already become a\nzone of activity for Islamist terror directed against Israel, because of\nthe breakdown in law and order in recent months. The attacks on the\npipeline bringing Egyptian gas to Israel, and the recent terror attack\nin Eilat, are testimony to this. So while the \"Shia crescent\" may have\nsuffered a strategic setback as a result of the upheavals in the Arab\nworld, the space left by the fall of regional leaders looks to be filled\nlargely by new, Sunni Islamist forces.

We believe\nthe view still holds. We do not expect a hard\nlanding in China that would destabilize the US\neconomy in 2017, but the risks grow significantly\nin 2018 and 2019. As we discuss below, China may\nnevertheless represent a geopolitical risk in 2017.\nHistorically, since WWII, the odds of a\nrecession occurring over a 12-month period\nhave been 18%. Our composite recession model,\nincorporating end-of-year financial and economic\ndata, estimates the probability of a recession in\n2017 at 23%. Once we incorporate the likely\npassage of a fiscal stimulus package of tax cuts\nand infrastructure investments in the latter half\nof 2017, the probability of a recession this year\ndeclines to about 15%.\n\nRising Influence of Populist Parties in\n\nthe Eurozone\n\nSince the election of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\nand the Syriza Party in Greece in January 2015,\npopulism has been gaining momentum across\nEurope. The support for populist parties has\nincreased to varying degrees in Spain, Greece, Italy,\nFrance, the Netherlands, Germany and Austria.\nThe common themes among populists have been\nanti-immigration and anti-European Union.\nOutside the Eurozone, the 2016 Brexit vote in\nGreat Britain has been interpreted as a populist\n\nvote against immigration from Eastern Europe, the\nMiddle East and North Africa, as well as against\nthe bureaucracy of the European Union.\n\nThe increasing enthusiasm for populist parties\nin Europe raises two questions. First, will any of\nthe more extremist parties win enough support to\nbreak away from the European Union? In France,\nfor example, upcoming elections in May 2017 are\nlikely to pit Francois Fillon of Les Républicains\nagainst Marine Le Pen of the far right Front\nNational. Le Pen has promised a referendum on\nwhether France should stay in the European Union,\nand, should she win, questions about the viability\nof the Eurozone will surface immediately.°* While\npolls show Fillon well ahead of Le Pen, polls\nhave been wrong on the UK and Italian referenda\nand the US election. The Eurasia Group, for one,\nassigns a 30% probability to a Le Pen victory.*”\n\nSecond, to what extent will the rise of populism\ninfluence policies in the Eurozone? Here, Germany\nwill probably provide a litmus test. Chancellor\nAngela Merkel and her coalition government are\nlikely to respond to recent terrorist attacks there by\nproposing a stronger police and military presence,\naccording to the Eurasia Group. Security checks\nwill probably be increased as well, since at least\n800,000 asylum-seekers entered Germany with\nminimal security checks and terrorist suspects have\nalready been arrested among them.°* With German\nelections scheduled for September 2017, it remains\nto be seen whether Chancellor Merkel will adjust\nher immigration policy.\n\n28 | Goldman Sachs | JANUARY 2017\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014561\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Since taking office in\nFebruary, Guo Shuqing, China's top banking regulator—with\nthe nickname “Whirlwind Guo” for his no-nonsense\nmanagement style—has already issued a series of directives to\nreduce leverage. For example, banks were asked to implement\nhigher standards for interbank lending and for selling third-\nparty wealth management products (a primary source of\nfunding for the shadow banking system). In April, China's top\ninsurance regulator was detained for corruption, and the\nregulatory agency has since taken disciplinary actions against\nsome high-profile insurance companies that have deviated\nfrom the core insurance business by using shorter-term funding\nto finance corporate takeovers, as well as overseas acquisition\nsprees.\n\nTomorrow Never Knows\n\nWhile we believe China’s economy should hold up well going\ninto the 19th Party’s Congress this autumn, its growth is likely\nto decelerate, and the lagged effects of the tightening measures\non the shadow banking system and on the housing market\ncould become quite visible by 2018. Housing price changes\ncould be flat or even negative by this time next year.\n\nIf the past is any guide, Chinese policymakers may once again\nloosen property purchase restrictions next year to stimulate\ngrowth. Therein lies the moral hazard—it is well known that\nChinese policymakers would not risk a sizeable correction in\nthe housing market, and therefore would reflate again to\nstrengthen economic growth. However, with property prices in\nChina’s tier-one cities already on par with or even exceeding\nthose of major global cities, it will be hard to rationalize another\n\nCHART 4: YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN CHINESE IMPORTS (BILLIONS OF USD)\n\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n-10%\n-20%\n-30%\n2011\n\n2012 2013\n\nThese measures have driven up China interbank lending rates,\nas well as corporate bond yields. The squeeze on the shadow\nbanking system has led to a big jump in aborted bond issuance.\nIn May, China’s net corporate bond issuance dropped to a\nrecord low of negative 217 billion yuan as some bond issuers\nwere unable to roll over their maturing bonds.\n\nOn the housing front, various cities have rolled out new\nadministrative measures with the aim of keeping housing prices\nflat. A few cities even resorted to the draconian measure of a\n10-year lock-up period for new apartment purchases—buyers\nof new apartments built on recently auctioned off land are\nprohibited from selling their units for a decade.\n\nChina has also continued to stem the capital outflow. Starting\nthis July, Chinese banks and financial institutions have to report\nall domestic and overseas cash transfers of more than 50,000\nyuan ($7,700), compared to the prior threshold of 200,000 yuan\n($29,338). Funds transferred overseas are prohibited from\npurchasing properties, investments, and insurance products.\nVarious new restrictions have also been placed on Bitcoin\ntrading exchanges, as well as overseas use of credit cards. In\nshort, it appears that capital flight from China will get somewhat\nmore difficult for ordinary citizens.\n\n2014\n\n2015 2016 2017\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nround of substantial price increases. In other words, using the\nproperty market as a lever to stimulate economic growth is not\na sustainable long-term solution.\n\nAlthough equity volatility picked up some in June, most equity\ninvestors still appeared to be basking in the glow of a\nsynchronized global recovery. However, the canary in the coal\nmine may be iron ore: having rallied from the December 2015\nlow of $37.50 per metric ton to nearly $95 in February 2017, it\nhas lost roughly 30% to $65 a metric ton by the end of June.\n\nIn the final analysis, the global economy has benefited from\nChina’s rapid growth. However, China will likely be at a\ncrossroads as President Xi embarks on his second term in 2018.\nWill policymakers inflate the housing bubble further to support\neconomic growth? Will they find new levers to keep the\neconomy growing above 6% per annum, or will they settle for\na lower but more sustainable pace? The law of large numbers\nportends that the next five years will likely be more challenging\nfor Chinese policymakers than the last five years. @\n\nGLOBAL FORESIGHT THIRD QUARTER 2017\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012087\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

With knowledge-based programming, we have a way of creating an actual\nrepresentation of real things in the world, in a precise and symbolic way. Not only is it\nunderstandable by brains and communicable to other brains and to computers, it’s also\nimmediately executable.\n\nJust as natural language gave us civilization, knowledge-based programming will\ngive us—what? One bad answer is that it will give us the civilization of the Als. That’s\nwhat we don’t want to happen, because the Als will do a great job communicating with\none another and we’ll be left out of it, because there’s no intermediate language, no\ninterface with our brains. What will this fourth level of knowledge communication lead\nto? If you were Caveman Ogg and you were just realizing that language was starting,\ncould you imagine the coming of civilization? What should we be imagining right now?\n\nThis relates to the question of what the world would look like if most people\ncould code. Clearly, many trivial things would change: Contracts would be written in\ncode, restaurant recipes might be written in code, and so on. Simple things like that\nwould change. But much more profound things would also change. The rise of literacy\ngave us bureaucracy, for example, which had already existed but dramatically\naccelerated, giving us a greater depth of governmental systems, for better or worse. How\ndoes the coding world relate to the cultural world?\n\nTake high school education. If we have computational thinking, how does that\naffect how we study history? How does that affect how we study languages, social\nstudies, and so on? The answer is, it has a great effect. Imagine you’re writing an essay.\nToday, the raw material for a typical high school student’s essay is something that’s\nalready been written; students usually can’t generate new knowledge easily. But in the\ncomputational world, that will no longer be true. If the students know something about\nwriting code, they’ll access all that digitized historical data and figure out something\nnew. Then they’ll write an essay about something they’ve discovered. The achievement\nof knowledge-based programming is that it’s no longer sterile, because it’s got the\nknowledge of the world knitted into the language you’ re using to write code.\n\nThere’s computation all over the universe: in a turbulent fluid producing some\ncomplicated pattern of flow, in the celestial mechanics of planetary interactions, in\nbrains. But does computation have a purpose? You can ask that about any system. Does\nthe weather have a goal? Does climate have a goal?\n\nCan someone looking at Earth from space tell that there’s anything with a purpose\nthere? Is there a civilization there? In the Great Salt Lake, in Utah, there’s a straight\nline. It turns out to be a causeway dividing two areas of the lake with different colors of\nalgae, so it’s a very dramatic straight line. There’s a road in Australia that’s long and\nstraight. There’s a railroad in Siberia that’s long, and lights go on when a train stops at\nthe stations. So from space you can see straight lines and patterns.\n\nBut are these clear enough examples of obvious purpose on Earth as viewed from\nspace? For that matter, how do we recognize extraterrestrials out there? How do we tell\nif a signal we’re getting indicates purpose? Pulsars were discovered in 1967, when we\npicked up a periodic flutter every second or so.

THOMAS —Wealthy sex o!ender Je!rey Epstein has been\nquietly working for years to construct a new compound on\nGreat St. James island o! the East End of St. Thomas, adding\nto a massive real estate portfolio that also includes\nneighboring Little St. James island, which has been his\nprimary residence for decades.\nJe!rey Epstein\nHOGP\nV.I. Department of Planning and Natural Resources\nspokesman Jamal Nielsen confirmed Monday that at least\nsome of that construction activity has been taking place\nwithout permission from the government — the third time\nin as many years that Epstein has gone beyond the scope of\npermitted building plans.\n“We have confirmed that there’s unauthorized work going on\nat Great St. James, we have been in touch with the owners\nand we are setting up to have a meeting with them soon, to\nrectify this,” Nielsen said.\nhttp://www.virginislandsdailynews.com/news/epstein-building-compoun…n-great-st-james/article_a49261e9-40f0-57b1-9501-605e26e74cf3.html\nPage 1 of 4\nEpstein building compound on Great St. James | News | virginislandsdailynews.com\n5/7/19, 9(15 AM\nNielsen could not say what specifically the unauthorized\nwork consists of, but said DPNR Commissioner nominee\nJean-Pierre Oriol would be available by phone today to\nanswer questions about the situation.\nDocuments on file at the Coastal Zone Management division\nof DPNR show that Epstein used “Great St. Jim, LLC,” a shell\ncompany organized by St. Thomas attorney Erika Kellerhals,\nto purchase three parcels totaling 80.1 acres from the Danish\nKjaer family for $17.5 million on Jan. 18, 2016.\nThe remainder of the island — 12 parcels totaling 81.22 acres\n— was transferred from another St. Thomas company, GSJ\nProperties Corp., to Great St. Jim LLC for $5 million on Jan.\n21, 2016.\nWhile it’s long been rumored that Epstein had purchased\nGreat St. James, for years his name appeared nowhere on\npublicly available documents listing property ownership of\nthe island.\nThe Daily News requested access to documents contained in\nCoastal Zone Management permit application files for the\nisland on April 18, and was provided access to those records\nMonday.\nThe documents show that in 2011, Kellerhals, another\nattorney in her firm, Gregory Ferguson, and business\nconsultant Brett Geary organized the St. Thomas company\nPoplar Inc.\nA certificate of incumbency contained in the file lists Epstein\nas president of Poplar Inc., his longtime lawyer Darren\nIndyke is listed as vice president and secretary, and another\nlongtime associate, Richard Kahn, is listed as treasurer.\nThe Daily Beast reported in April that Kellerhals, Indyke, and\nKahn are listed as the only o\"cers of other defunct\nnonprofits run by Epstein, including the C.O.U.Q.\nFoundation, J. Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation, and Epstein\nInterests. They’re also listed as o\"cers for Gratitude America\nLtd., a nonprofit formed in the Virgin Islands in 2012 through\nwhich Epstein has made financial contributions to various\norganizations.\nThe certificate specifically states that those individuals are\nauthorized to act on behalf of the corporation with respect to\nall transactions, “including but not limited to transactions\nrelated to permitting matters submitted on behalf of Great\nSt. Jim, LLC.”\nhttp://www.virginislandsdailynews.com/news/epstein-building-compoun…n-great-st-james/article_a49261e9-40f0-57b1-9501-605e26e74cf3.html\nPage 2 of 4\nEpstein building compound on Great St. James | News | virginislandsdailynews.com\n5/7/19, 9(15 AM\nKellerhals organized Great St. Jim LLC on Oct. 26, 2015, with\nherself as the sole member, and identified Geary’s company,\nBusiness Basics VI LLC, as the resident agent.\nKellerhals could not be reached for comment Monday.\nDocuments contained in the permit application file show\nthat DPNR employees and Epstein’s sta! have been\ncommunicating for years about the project.\n“[H]i Erika, spoke with Je! yesterday and let him know that\nthe scopes of work from both applications are being\ncombined into one single permit. Dave of my sta! is\nsupposed to reach out to the LSJ [Little St. James] sta! and\narrange when he can make the required site visit. there are\nsome specific details that were not included in the\napplication package, so they will have to be verified during\nthe site visit and notes made on the submitted drawings,”\nOriol wrote to Kellerhals in an email dated Aug. 16, 2016,\nunder the subject line, “RE: Cistern Permit.”\nAn email from DPNR legal counsel Michele Baker to\nKellerhals dated Aug. 26, 2016, lists a number of documents\nrequired for the permit application to proceed, and indicates\nthat “the OWNER” has to sign o!.\nKellerhals responded in an email that “I understand that\nthere are some places where the owner needs to sign if the\nattorney completes the application. I will discuss with Je!rey\nand get you copies of those signed attachments asap. You are\ncorrect that I am no longer the sole member. In fact, I am not\na member at all. The only position I serve is as counsel to\nGreat St. Jim.”\nEpstein signed o! on the application for a Coastal Zone\nManagement major permit on Jan. 10, 2017, identifying\nhimself as “President of Poplar, Inc., sole member of Great\nSt. Jim, LLC.”\nPermit application documents and site plans on file show\nthat Epstein is planning a complex of buildings across the\napproximately 160-acre island, connected by private road.\nThe plans include a barge dock, two homes, cottages, an\namphitheater, gardens, a marine electrical cable, solar array\nand generator, storage building, security building, workshed\nand machine shop, and an “underwater o\"ce & pool.”\nThe permit application addresses mitigation e!orts for\nendangered corals and the Virgin Islands tree boa — which\nwas spotted on the island during site visits — and indicates\nhttp://www.virginislandsdailynews.com/news/epstein-building-compoun…n-great-st-james/article_a49261e9-40f0-57b1-9501-605e26e74cf3.html\nPage 3 of 4\nEpstein building compound on Great St. James | News | virginislandsdailynews.com\n5/7/19, 9(15 AM\nthat the public will still have free access to the island’s\nshoreline, which includes Christmas Cove, a popular boating\nsite and home to floating restaurant Pizza Pi.\nA wealthy financier long associated with the rich and\npowerful, including former President Bill Clinton and\nPresident Donald Trump, Epstein, 66, was convicted in 2008\nof procuring a child under the age of 18 for prostitution.\nAn investigation by the Miami Herald found that despite\nevidence Epstein sexually abused dozens of underage girls,\nsome who say they were forced to have sex with Epstein’s\nrich friends at his various homes, including on Little St.\nJames, federal prosecutor Alexander Acosta — who now\nserves as U.S. secretary of labor — worked with Epstein’s\ndefense attorneys to craft an extraordinarily lenient plea\ndeal.\nA federal judge ruled in February that Miami prosecutors\nviolated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act when they\nintentionally kept that agreement secret from victims in the\ncase.\nWhile Epstein owns lavish properties in New York City, Palm\nBeach, and New Mexico that he travels between on his private\nBoeing 727, he lists Little St. James as his primary residence\non his sex o!ender registration.\nEpstein last verified his registration with the V.I.

It’s no coincidence that the order is reversed here: in the case of CogPrime,\nAGLethics considerations played a major role in the design process ... and thus the chapter on\nethics occurs near the beginning rather than the end. In the CogPrime approach, ethics is not\na particularly distinct topic, being richly interwoven with cognition and education and other\naspects of the AGI project.\n\nThe ethics of advanced AGI is a complex issue with multiple aspects. Among the many issues\nthere are:\n\n1. Risks posed by the possibility of human beings using AGI systems for evil ends\n\n2. Risks posed by AGI systems created without well-defined ethical systems\n\n3. Risks posed by AGI systems with initially well-defined and sensible ethical systems eventu-\nally going rogue — an especially big risk if these systems are more generally intelligent than\nhumans, and possess the capability to modify their own source code\n\n4, the ethics of experimenting on AGI systems when one doesn’t understand the nature of\ntheir experience\n\n5. AGTrights: in what circumstances does using an AGI as a tool or servant constitute “slavery”\n\nIn this chapter we will focus mainly (though not exclusively) on the question of how to create\nan AGI with a rational and beneficial ethical system. After a somewhat wide-ranging discussion,\nwe will conclude with eight general points that we believe should be followed in working toward\n\"Friendly AGI\" — most of which have to do, not with the internal design of the AGI, but with\nthe way the AGI is taught and interfaced with the real world.\n\nWhile most of the particulars discussed in this book have nothing to do with ethics, it’s\nimportant for the reader to understand that AGI-ethics considerations have played a major\nrole in many of our design decisions, underlying much of the technical contents of the book. As\nthe materials in this chapter should make clear, ethicalness is probably not something that one\ncan meaningfully tack onto an AGI system at the end, after developing the rest — it is likely\ninfeasible to architect an intelligent agent and then add on an “ethics module.” Rather, ethics\nis something that has to do with all the different memory systems and cognitive processes that\n\n205\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013121\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It’s a catch-22: How cana\ngirl not old enough to vote be a prostitute? And yet, many girls not old\nenough to vote are prostitutes.\n\nCompounding Epstein’s predicament, the world outside of his\ncarefully constructed and controlled environment is someplace that he seems\nnot just ill-equipped to handle but in which he seems to be blindly grouping\nabout (i.e. he’s totally tone deaf). I visited him once during this time and\nfound him weighing the conflicting advice of some of the most vaunted and\negomaniacal lawyers (along with Dershowitz and Black, celebrity criminal\nattorney, Gerald Lefcourt, and Clinton prosecutor, Ken Starr) of the\nday—anyone with new advice, Epstein seemed to hire—as well as a catchall\nof the leading crisis managers, who he seemed to retain at will, all wrangling\nfor fees and primacy.\n\nCertainly, the upshot of his dealings with the Justice Department seem\nto involve a through-the-looking-glass logic. The government threatens\nto prosecute him (with the possibility of a 10-year sentence) and\nvarious friends, associates, and lovers, or offers an ass-backwards\nsort of deal in which Epstein’s lawyers have to go to the Palm Beach\nauthorities and get them to agree to charge him with an offense that\nwill send him to jail and get him a sex offender status. Except that a\nsolicitation charge won't produce that result. Therefore he has to\nagree also to a procurement or pimping charge (even though he has\npaid money, not received it—the sine qua non of pimping). What’s\nmore, he has to agree to pay the legal fees of any of the girls who\nwant to sue him—and, not to defend himself from their suits—forcing\nhim to settle with each of the girls for what are reportedly high 6-figure\nsums or more.\n\nHe’s sentence to jail in 2008 for 18 months and serves 13 (while\nEpstein is now frequently accused of somehow managing to cut short\nhis sentence, almost all Florida prisoners serve only 70% of their\nofficially sentenced time).\n\nThis hardly ends the legal catch all.

Numerous journalists have published books and articles retracing the\npaths that led the world economy to the precipice two years ago. The deregulation of the financial\nservices industry in the 1980s and ’90s; the growing popularity of complex and risky derivatives; the real\nestate bubble and the explosion of subprime lending — none of these developments were exactly secret.\nOn the contrary, they were celebrated as vindications of the power and wisdom of markets. Accordingly,\n\nMr. Ferguson recycles choice moments of triumphalism, courtesy of Lawrence H. Summers, George W.\n\nBush, Alan Greenspan and various cable television ranters and squawkers.\n\nEven as stock indexes soared and profits swelled, there were always at least a few investors, economists\nand government officials who warned that the frenzied speculation was leading to the abyss. Some of\nthese prophets without honor show up in front of Mr. Ferguson’s camera, less to gloat than to present,\n\nonce again, the analyses that were dismissed and ignored by their peers for so long.\n\nDozens of interviews — along with news clips and arresting aerial shots of New York, Iceland and other\ndisaster areas — are folded into a clear and absorbing history, narrated by Matt Damon. The music (an\nopening song, “Big Time,” by Peter Gabriel, and a score by Alex Heffes) and the clean wide-screen\ncinematography provide an aesthetic polish that is welcome for its own sake and also important to the\nmovie's themes. The handsomely lighted and appointed interiors convey a sense of the rarefied,\nprivileged worlds in which the Wall Street operators and their political enablers flourished, and the\nelegance of the presentation also subliminally bolsters the film’s authority. This is not a piece of ragged\n\nmuckraking or breathless advocacy. It rests its outrage on reason, research and careful argument.\n\nThe same was true of Mr. Ferguson’s previous documentary, “No End in Sight,” which focused on\n\ncatastrophic policies carried out in Iraq by President George W. Bush’s administration just after the\n\noverthrow of Saddam Hussein. But whereas that film concentrated on a narrow view of a complex subject\n— the conduct of the war rather than the at least equally controversial rationale for fighting it — “Inside\nJob” offers a sweeping synthesis, going as far back as the Reagan administration and as far afield as\n\nIceland in its anatomy of the financial crisis.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, many of the highest-profile players declined to be interviewed. Mr. Summers\nappears only in news footage, and none of his predecessors or successors as Treasury secretary — not\nRobert E. Rubin or Henry M. Paulson Jr. or Timothy F. Geithner — submit to Mr. Ferguson’s questions.\nNor do any of the top executives at Goldman Sachs or the other big banks. Most of the interviewees are,\nat least from the perspective of the filmmaker, friendly witnesses, adding fuel to the director’s\ncomprehensive critique of the way business has been done in the United States and the other advanced\n\ncapitalist countries for the past two decades.\n\nBoth American political parties are indicted; “Inside Job” is not simply another belated settling of\naccounts with Mr. Bush and his advisers, though they are hardly ignored. The scaling back of government\noversight and the weakening of checks on speculative activity by banks began under Reagan and\ncontinued during the Clinton administration. And with each administration the market in derivatives\n\nexpanded, and alarms about the dangers of this type of investment were ignored.

The lease agreement was most recently amended in December\n2018. The agreement also governs utilization of office space and parking spaces at various IRCs and retail facilities that we use as hubs.\n\nUnder the amended lease agreement, hubs generally have cancellable two-year terms subject to certain two consecutive one-year renewal\noptions and subject to the terms of any master lease under which we are subleasing. We increased our utilization of the DriveTime IRCs in Blue Mound,\nTexas, and Delanco, New Jersey, to 100% as of July 2018. Under the lease agreement, we pay a monthly rental fee related to our pro rata utilization of\nspace at such facilities plus a pro rata share of each facility’s actual insurance costs and real estate taxes. As it relates to locations where we recondition\nvehicles, our share of facility and reconditioning-supplies expenses are calculated monthly by multiplying the actual costs for operating the inspection\ncenters by an amount related to our pro rata share of total reconditioned vehicles and parking spaces used at such IRCs in a given month. Total expenses\nrelated to this lease agreement were approximately $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\nHOUSTON, TX VENDING MACHINE LEASE GUARANTEE\n\nOn July 14, 2015, DriveTime guaranteed our obligations under the lease governing our occupancy of the property on which our Houston\nvending machine is located. We do not compensate DriveTime for the guarantee. The initial lease term commenced January 8, 2016, and we began paying\nbase rent on May 7, 2016. Base rent during the initial term is $23.0 thousand per month, and the initial term expires on April 6, 2026. We have the option to\nextend the initial term for four additional consecutive five-year periods. Base rent during each extension term will increase 10% of the then-current base\nrent for each subsequent extension.\n\nTEMPE, AZ OFFICE LEASE\n\nIn September 2016, we entered into an agreement to lease the second floor of our corporate headquarters in Tempe, Arizona beginning April\n2017. Pursuant to this lease, we paid an initial monthly base rent of $107.0 thousand, which increases throughout the duration of the lease. The lease has an\ninitial term of 83 months and we have three 5-year extension options. At the request of the landlord, DriveTime agreed to partially guarantee our lease\npayments until the 30th full calendar month of the lease. We do not compensate DriveTime for the guarantee.\n\nIn connection with this lease, we entered into a sublease with DriveTime for our use of the first floor of the same building. Under the sublease,\nwhich is coterminous with DriveTime’s master lease and has a term of 83 months, subject to our right to exercise three 5-year extension options, we pay\nDriveTime rent equal to the amounts due under the master lease, including initial monthly base rent of $102.0 thousand, beginning April 1, 2018, which\nincreases throughout the duration of the sublease and master lease.

People learn things gradually, and\nshow a continuous development in ability, not a quick jump from ignorance to mastery. We\nbelieve that this gradual development of ability is the signature of genuine learning, and that\nprescriptively an AGI system must be designed in order to have continuous and asymmetrical\ndevelopment across a variety of tasks in order to be considered a genuine learning system. While\nquantum leaps in ability may be possible in an AGI system which can just “graft” new parts\nof brain onto itself (or an augmented human which may someday be able to do the same using\nimplants), such acquisition of knowledge is not really learning. Grafting on knowledge does not\nbuild the cognitive pathways needed in order to actually learn. If this is the only mechanism\navailable to an AGI system to acquire new knowledge, then it is not really a learning system.\n\n11.4 Piaget’s Stages in the Context of Uncertain Inference\n\nPiaget’s developmental stages are very general, referring to overall types of learning, not specific\nmechanisms or methods. This focus was natural since the context of his work was human de-\nvelopmental psychology, and neuroscience has not yet progressed to the point of understanding\nthe neural mechanisms underlying any sort of inference (and certainly was nowhere near to\ndoing so in Piaget’s time!). But if one is studying developmental psychology in an AGI context\nwhere one knows something about the internal mechanisms of the AGI system under consid-\neration, then one can work with a more specific model of learning. Our focus here is on AGI\nsystems whose operations contain uncertain inference as a central component. Obviously the\nmain focus is CogPrime, but the essential ideas apply to any other uncertain inference centric\nAGI architecture as well.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013109\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

For\nexample, I understand that she has accused distinguished Professor Alan Dershowitz of Harvard\nLaw School of sexual misconduct involving her. Professor Dershowitz has flatly denied that\nallegation under oath in a federal court proceeding. I further understand that Professor\nDershowitz offered to play a tape recording for Mr. Hill that evidences that Jane Doe 3 has made\nrecent contradictory statements—that is, that she was pressured into including Professor\nDershowitz in her allegations and that she has a financial motive in making these allegations.\n\nThe Duke of York and the Royal Palace have likewise unequivocally denied Jane Doe’s\nsimilar allegations against the Duke. Surely, these unequivocal statements of denial of respected\nmembers of society are entitled to some deference by ABC, particularly where, as here, there is\nsubstantial evidence of bias, improper motive, and serious credibility problems of their accuser.\n\nMoreover, additional claims of Jane Doe 3 can be refuted with objective evidence that is\nreadily obtainable by ABC. For example, she claims she was in the presence of both former\nPresident Clinton (after January 20, 2001, and before the summer of 2002) and former Vice\nPresident Gore (and his wife) at Mr. Epstein’s Virgin Island home. I have been told by Mr. Hill\nthat she claims to be 100% sure of the facts regarding President Clinton. The claims are\ncompletely uncorroborated and compellingly contradicted by others. Neither former President\nClinton nor former Vice-President Gore and his wife have ever been present at Mr. Epstein’s\nVirgin Island home. A review of United States Secret Service records, obtainable through a\nFreedom of Information Request would prove the falsity of the claim. Virgin Island government\nrecords would provide further confirmation. I also believe that Mr. Hill has been told by\nindividuals with percipient knowledge that former President Clinton has never been to Mr.\nEpstein’s Virgin Island home. Upon inquiry, I am certain that you would receive similar denials\nfrom Mr. and Mrs. Gore either directly or by or through their counsel Mr. Boies. Jane Doe 3’s\nfabrication of these claims against respected former officials undermines completely the\ntrustworthiness of each and every one of her remaining allegations.\n\nWe would expect that, in the wake of the damning independent review of Rolling Stone’s\npublications of rape allegations involving students at the University of Virginia, ABC would\nproceed with similar, uncorroborated allegations with extreme caution. At the very least, ABC\nhas an obligation to verify—with independent evidence—the truthfulness of Jane Doe 3’s\nclaims. Merely declining to air those portions of her interview that relate to President Clinton\nand Vice-President Gore is insufficient. If ABC has concerns about her credibility with respect\nto any allegation, it must decline to republish all of her allegations.\n\nIn June of 2008, Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty to Florida state charges that do not relate to\nJane Doe 3. After an extensive investigation, the United States declined to prosecute Mr. Epstein\nand provided him with a Non-Prosecution Agreement. Mr. Epstein fully conformed to the\nresponsibilities and obligations imposed on him by that agreement. Mr. Epstein is not engaged\nin public activities. He is a private person who has complied and continues to comply with his\nlegal obligations, and he is attempting to move forward with his life in a productive way. The\nallegations of Jane Doe 3 are neither credible nor news worthy. ABC should not publish them.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028929\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Here is how [ find\nauthor] , in his book , describes the origins of this lifelong collaborative effort.\n\n[Justice Goldberg] called his law clerk Alan Dershowitz into his office and advanced the\ndecidedly immodest idea of using the Constitution to end the death penalty in America.\n\n“The Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment,” Goldberg told\nDershowitz. “What could be more cruel than the deliberate decision by the state to take a\nhuman life?”\n\nAlan Dershowitz immediately understood the impudence of Goldberg’s proposal. It was\nDershowitz’s very first day on the job and the young clerk, already brimming with energy\nand enthusiasm, was elated by the Justice’s proposed agenda.\n\nWhen Goldberg sat down with Dershowitz in the summer of 1963, not even the American\nCivil Liberties Union believed that capital punishment posed a potential violation of\nconstitutional rights. Dershowitz made this point to Goldberg. “At the time the Eighth\nAmendment was enacted, the colonists were executing people all over the place.\n\nCertainly the framers of the Constitution did not regard the death penalty as\nunconstitutional.”\n\n“Therein lies the beauty of our Bill of Rights,” Goldberg said. “It’s an evolving document.\nIt means something different today than it meant in 1792.”\n\nIn Alan Dershowitz, Goldberg found a kindred spirit and a life story that was in many\nways the New York parallel of his own Chicago childhood...Dershowitz had an aversion\nto capital punishment, which traced back to his childhood. Dershowitz argued against\ncapital punishment as a member of his high school debating team. [I still have a\nhandwritten card from my first high school debate in which I advocate the “abolision of\nC.P.” because “most murderers are products of invironment.”] In law school, he wrote a\nletter to the Prime Minister of Israel...arguing that the death penalty was inappropriate\neven for Adolf Eichmann.\n\nGoldberg’s choice of Dershowitz to write his capital punishment opinion was no\ncoincidence. Goldberg passed on the issue during his first year on the bench in part\nbecause he did not feel that he had the right clerks. He inherited his first set of clerks from\nFelix Frankfurter. Though he had high regard for the retiring justice’s selections, he didn’t\nfeel they were right for the job.\n\nThey worked together through scholarship and advocacy against the death penalty for the\nremainder of Goldberg’s life.

But in the second part of May, our internal\npolling showed things were moving in our direction. In mid-May, they had me\nabove 40 percent. A final batch of internal polls, on the Friday before election day,\nhad me just short of 50 percent. But I told our pollsters that under no circumstances\nwere they to divulge the results to anyone in the campaign team. This wasn’t just\nbecause I wanted to guard against complacency. It was because, deep down, still I\ndidn’t trust the numbers.\n\nI retreated to Kochav Yair on Friday evening. On Saturday, two days before the\nelection, I had a surprise visitor, someone I knew from Yitzhik Mordecai’s team.\nHe said he had a letter for me, with terms of a proposal under which Yitzhik would\nannounce an eleventh-hour withdrawal from the race. I still could not be absolutely\nconfident I’d win, at least in the first round. Yitzhik’s pulling out would help. But\nif I did win, I wanted to start the process of assembling a coalition with a blank\nslate and an open mind. Doing a deal was not the way to begin. I didn’t accept or\nopen the envelope. “Go back to Yitzhik,” I said. “Tell him, as he knows, that I\nhave a lot of respect for him. But this is a decision that he has to make on his own.”\n\nThe next day, less than 24 hours before the polls opened, all of the three other\ncandidates announced they were pulling out. Benny Begin and Azmi Beshara were\nnever going to affect the outcome. But Yitzhik’s withdrawal very possibly would.\nWhen he spoke to reporters, he said it had been one of the most difficult decisions\nhe’d had to make, but that he’d concluded he wouldn’t get enough votes to reach\nhis “primary goal” of defeating Bibi. “The prime minister was given a chance and\nhe failed,” he said. ““We must give Barak a chance.”\n\nI got up early on May 17, confident we’d done everything we could to put\nourselves in a position to win, but also aware, from Shimon’s defeat, that the\nsmallest of details, and the narrowest of margins, might determine the outcome.\nAfter the 1996 election, I’d learned of cases where Peres volunteers outside polling\nstations in the Negev or the north of the country had left early, in order to make\nsure they’d be back to Tel Aviv in time for the “moment of victory.” Now, I sent\nout word that all our volunteers must stay in place until the polls had closed.

It is without question one of the most vital works of our time.\nLet’s begin with what inspired you to write it.\n\nSiegel: Thanks for having me Jamie. As a young boy born in the mid 1950s, I was fascinated with footage of\nHitler and the Third Reich and could never understand how the Jews of the time could not see the evil that\nseemed so obvious. Not yet appreciative of the benefit of hindsight, I could not comprehend the blindness.\nFollowing 9/11, like so many others, I began to study Islam, its history, its current movements, terrorism and\nso on. As I would learn one stunning aspect after another, I would discuss them with friends and associates.\nRather than confront the facts I would present, they would find one clever way after another to avoid the\nfrightening truth of what America and the West truly face. Their fear appeared obvious to me. I began to\ncatalog many of my friends’ different maneuvers to dispel the anxiety that they found so difficult to endure.\nThe more I focused on their mental processes (as well as my own) the more I began to see a structure to the\nmental endeavor and to understand what I had, as a child, found so difficult to explain.\n\nFP: Tell us about the Control Factor, what you describe as “that effort our minds enga ge in in order to keep\nus blind” and that “process of a voiding seeing the threats we face.” It’s also about, as you state, trying to\nbelieve that the threat is under our control, when in fact it is not. Kindly enlighten us as to these profound\ninsights you make in terms of the Control Factor.\n\nSiegel: First, let’s distinguish the ”real world” where real battles are taking place from the mental battlefield\nwhich occurs in each of our minds. We tend to believe our perceptions are simply clear realizations of what\nis “out there” and overlook how much our internal worlds can literally determine what we see. When our\ninternal minds become anxious and sense a loss of “control,” they tend to concoct ways to distort our\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024420\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It involved two families.\nThe family of the killer consisted of the father, mother and three sons. The family of the victims\nconsisted of a father, mother, baby and niece. They would meet, with horrendous consequences,\non a dark, isolated road in Arizona.\n\nBeyond the tragic facts of the case was the important legal issue they presented, since neither\nRicky nor his brother Raymond Tison actually killed anyone. Nor did they intend anyone to die\nwhen they helped their father Gary and his cellmate Randy Greenawalt escape from prison. But at\nleast four innocent people—including a baby and a 15 year old girl—were brutally murdered by\nthe prisoners whom the Tison brothers helped escape.*’ And for playing that role Ricky and\nRaymond Tison, who were teenagers, were sentenced to die in the Arizona gas chamber.\n\nAs part of the overall challenge to the death penalty, abolitionists were focusing on the significant\nnumber of death row inmates who had neither killed nor intended to kill. Most of these non-\ntriggermen had been convicted of murder on the basis of two legal fictions. The first was the law\nof conspiracy under which each member of a conspiracy is deemed to have committed every\ncrime actually committed by any co-conspirator*’ (Remember Harry Reems.) The second legal\nfiction was the law of felony-murder under which anyone who intentionally commits a serious\nfelony, such as breaking someone out of prison, is deemed to have “intended” any death that\nresults from the felony, even if he actually intended that no one should die. The combined effect\nof these fictions was to deem Ricky and Raymond as guilty of intentional murder as Gary Tison\nand Randy Greenawalt who actually pulled the trigger and intended to kill the victims.\n\nThe Tison case thus starkly presented an issue that had not clearly been resolved by the Supreme\nCourt since the Furman case: Can conspirators who helped murderers escape from prison be\nsentenced to death for intentional murders committed by their co-conspirators, if the conspirators\nthemselves neither killed nor intended to kill.\n\nI was first approached to help the Tison brothers by a journalist who was working on a book and\nfilm project about the case (eventually a film, called A Killer In the Family, was made starring\nRobert Mitchum as the father and James Spader—in his first cinemographic role—as one of the\nbrothers.) I was asked to appeal their death sentence. Since they had no money, I agreed to\nprepare and argue the appeal without a fee.\n\nI know the appeal would be tough because the facts of the murders were horrible and the\npersonnel on the Supreme Court was changing in a rightward direction. The strongest point in\nour favor were the facts of the case as they related directly to the brothers Tison. Their story was\ncompelling.\n\n57 Maybe also a honeymoon couple.\n58 Pinkerton\n\n165\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017252\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Thanks to the Washington Post’s unnamed law-enforcement\nleakers, we know Mr. Nunes’s request deals with a “top secret intelligence source” of the FBI and CIA,\nwho is a U.S. citizen and who was involved in the Russia collusion probe. When government agencies refer\nto sources, they mean people who appear to be average citizens but use their profession or contacts to spy\nfor the agency. Ergo, we might take this to mean that the FBI secretly had a person on the payroll who used\n\nhis or her non-FBI credentials to interact in some capacity with the Trump campaign.\n\nThis would amount to spying, and it is hugely disconcerting. It would also be a major escalation from the\nelectronic surveillance we already knew about, which was bad enough. Obama political appointees\nrampantly “unmasked” Trump campaign officials to monitor their conversations, while the FBI played dirty\nwith its surveillance warrant against Carter Page, failing to tell the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\nthat its supporting information came from the Hillary Clinton campaign. Now we find it may have also been\n\nrolling out human intelligence, John Le Carré style, to infiltrate the Trump campaign.\n\nWhich would lead to another big question for the FBI: When? The bureau has been doggedly sticking with\nits story that a tip in July 2016 about the drunken ramblings of George Papadopoulos launched its\ncounterintelligence probe. Still, the players in this affair—the FBI, former Director Jim Comey, the Steele\ndossier authors—have been suspiciously vague on the key moments leading up to that launch date. When\nprecisely was the Steele dossier delivered to the FBI? When precisely did the Papadopoulos information\n\ncome in?\n\nAnd to the point, when precisely was this human source operating? Because if it was prior to that infamous\nPapadopoulos tip, then the FBI isn’t being straight. It would mean the bureau was spying on the Trump\ncampaign prior to that moment. And that in turn would mean that the FBI had been spurred to act on the\n\nbasis of something other than a junior campaign aide’s loose lips.\n\nWe also know that among the Justice Department’s stated reasons for not complying with the Nunes\nsubpoena was its worry that to do so might damage international relationships. This suggests the “source”\nmay be overseas, have ties to foreign intelligence, or both. That’s notable, given the highly suspicious role\nforeigners have played in this escapade. It was an Australian diplomat who reported the Papadopoulos\nconversation. Dossier author Christopher Steele is British, used to work for MI6, and retains ties to that spy\nagency as well as to a network of former spooks. It was a former British diplomat who tipped off Sen. John\n\nMcCain to the dossier. How this “top secret” source fits into this puzzle could matter deeply.\n\nI believe I know the name of the informant, but my intelligence sources did not provide it to me and refuse\n\nto confirm it.

Brown \nNine months before cutting a covert plea deal with sex trafficking suspect Jeffrey \nEpstei , Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta was notified that the lead \nprosecutor in Epstein's case had concealed victim information in another underage \nsex crimes case, the Miami Herald has learned. \nThe prosecutor, A. Marie Villafaria, was harshly rebuked by a federal judge in \nJanuary 2007 for what he called her \"intentional and/or serious lapse in judgment\" \nwhen she failed to explicitly inform him that the defendant, a Texas man who \ntraveled to Florida to have sex with a 14-year-old girl, had a prior history of \npredatory behavior with minors, court records show. \nAcosta, her boss at the time, not only knew about Villafaria's breach — records show \nthat he subsequently defended it. Acosta assigned another prosecutor in his office to \nwrite a treatise for the judge in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade him to soften \nthe stinging language in his order. \nSenior U.S. District Court Judge William J. Zloch copied Acosta on his order, \nnoting, \"The court is at a total loss as to why the Office of the United States Attorney \nfor the Southern District of Florida, as well as the Assistant United States Attorney \nassigned to the above-styled cause, found it appropriate to intentionally withhold ... \ninformation from the court.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021740 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021741 \nA. Marie Villafaria was the lead federal prosecutor in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case. The U.S. attorney's office's handling of \nthe prosecution, which led to a plea to minor charges in state court, has been harshly criticized. \nLater that year, Acosta and Villafaria put together a plea bargain for Epstein, a \nmultimillionaire money manager who sexually abused nearly three dozen teenage \ngirls at his mansion in Palm Beach. The deal, a federal judge ruled last month, was \nintentionally kept from his victims in violation of the Crime Victims' Rights Act. \nWhile the two cases are unrelated, it shows that both Acosta and Villafaria had been \nwarned about the importance of victim disclosure in sex crimes cases before the \nEpstein agreement. They nevertheless forged ahead with a pact with Epstein that \nviolated the law. \nU.S. District Court Judge Kenneth A. Marra wrote: \"When the Government gives \ninformation to victims, it cannot be misleading. While the Government spent untold \nhours negotiating the terms and implications of the [agreement] with Epstein's \nattorneys, scant information was shared with victims.\" \nThis comes as Acosta, who is now the U.S. secretary of labor, is facing mounting \nscrutiny for his oversight of the Epstein case. On Monday, White House press \nsecretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to say whether President Trump has full \nconfidence in Acosta, noting that Acosta's involvement in the Epstein case is \nGG \ncurrently under review.\" \nThe Justice Department launched a probe in January into whether Acosta, Villafaria \nand other prosecutors committed professional misconduct. \nFrancey Hakes, who worked in the Justice Department's Crimes Against Children \nunit, said Zloch's comments were so brutal that it should have deterred Acosta and \nVillafaria from keeping the deal secret. \n\"It is highly unusual for a court to allege an assistant U.S. attorney has intentionally \nwithheld information. That allegation is like dropping a bomb in the legal \ncommunity,\" she said. \nThe story behind a Palm Beach sex offender's remarkable deal \nPalm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, despite sexually abusing \ndozens of underage girls according to police and prosecutors. His victims have never \nhad a voice, until now. \n\"It seems to show that they are not taking these cases very seriously, they are not \nadvocating for strong punishment for sexual predators, and not advocating for \nvictims in a meaningful way.\" \nVillafaria, a well-regarded 18-year veteran federal prosecutor, would not comment \nfor this story. But her lawyer, Jonathan Biran, said she has worked tirelessly on \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021742 \nbehalf of crime victims. She received the 2011 National Crime Victims' Rights \nService Award as well as the Attorney General's Project Safe Childhood Award. \nHe also pointed out that the parents of the victim in the Texas man's case wrote a \nletter thanking Villafaria at the conclusion of the case. \n\"AUSA Villafaria has spent her 18-year career advocating tirelessly on behalf of \nvictims of some of the most serious crimes in Florida, and has received numerous \nawards for her successful prosecution of major cases,\" Biran said, adding that \nVillafaria has \"made South Florida a safer place for children and adults alike.\" \nEnticing a minor \nBy all accounts, Adam McDaniel was an awkward and shy Texas teenager who spent \ncountless hours on his computer, socializing with girls on the internet. \nIn 2005, McDaniel, then 19, traveled from Texas to Fort Lauderdale, where he \nhopped into a taxi and headed to Boca Raton to meet up with a 14-year-old girl he \nhad been talking to online for about a year. He picked up the ninth grader at a high \nschool basketball game, and drove her to a Marriott, hotel where they spent the \nnight, court records show. \nWhen she failed to come home that evening, her parents called Boca Raton police. \nOfficers tracked the pair down at the hotel the next day, where they found them in \nbed, clad in little more than their underwear, according to court records. \nMcDaniel was arrested on federal sex charges, and pleaded guilty on Oct. 6, 2006, to \nenticing a minor into sexual conduct by means of interstate commerce, which \ncarried a sentence of from five years up to 30 years in federal prison. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021743 \nU.S. District Judge William Zloch \nAt sentencing, McDaniel's public defender, Patrick Hunt, argued for a reduced \nsentence, blaming his client's immaturity for the crime. McDaniel had been a good \nstudent at Texas Tech and had a family that supported him, Hunt told Zloch. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021744 \nFamily and acquaintances, including a former Fort Worth police lieutenant, \nsubmitted letters to the court vouching for McDaniel's character. \nThere were other issues, however, presented to the judge. While McDaniel was \nbeing held in federal lockup awaiting sentencing, he had corresponded with his \nvictim, despite being ordered not to contact her, the court record shows. \nStill, Hunt argued that a sentence of five years was overly harsh. \nVillafaria disagreed, but conceded that McDaniel would benefit from psychological \ntreatment. She advocated for a sentence of five to sex years, which was at the low \nend of the guideline. \nIt was then that the judge heard from the victim's mother. \nIn a statement, the mother decried the emotional and mental trauma her daughter \nsuffered and the long road to recovery she had ahead of her. The mother mentioned \nshe was further upset that McDaniel continued contact with her daughter after his \narrest and she said she believed that McDaniel was still trying to manipulate her \ndaughter by blaming her for his arrest. \nThe mother pointed out that prior to their sexual encounter, McDaniel had directed \nher daughter to watch sexually explicit movies and had described for her sex \nactivities he had had with another underage girl. \nAt that point, the judge interrupted. \n\"...There has been some reference to another incident with a minor girl. What do \nyou know about that, if anything?\" Zloch asked Villafaria. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021745 \nFormer U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta never told sexual-abuse victims of a lenient plea \ndeal for Jeffrey Epstein. \nGetty Images \nOnly then did Zloch learn that McDaniel had preyed on other girls over the internet, \nincluding a 16-year-old California girl whom he brought to Texas and impregnated. \nHe was also having another relationship with a 15-year-old girl at the time of his \narrest, Villafaria admitted in court. \nThe judge promptly sentenced McDaniel to 10 years — twice what Villafaria \nrecommended. \nThree months later, in January 2007, after reviewing the entire case, Zloch issued \nan order excoriating Villafaria for failing to tell him about McDaniel's prior history. \n\"The serial nature of defendant's seduction of minor girls was revealed for the first \ntime to the court upon the Government's response to the Court's inquiry,\" Zloch \nwrote, explaining that the defendant's past was evidence of predatory behavior that \nwarranted a harsher sentence because he may pose a danger to the community. \nAssistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Lourie was assigned to try to correct the record and \npersuade the judge to strike a portion of his comments. They argued that since \nMcDaniel had never before been charged with a crime, the history was not relevant \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021746 \nat sentencing. The defendant's prior relationship with a 16-year-old was not illegal \nin Texas or in California, they said, and the girl classified her relationship as a \nfriendship. \nAll the relevant information was provided to the probation department and at \nMcDaniel's detention hearing, they added, making the point that it was in the record \nand therefore, not intentionally withheld by the government. \nWhile Zloch conceded that the information was part of the probation and bond \nhearing record, he said it was nevertheless the U.S. Attorney's Office's duty to \npresent the defendant's prior history with minors at sentencing. He refused to strike \nthe most critical portions of his order. \n\"Lack of candor to the court is a serious charge, and the judge has quite reasonably \nexpressed dismay that the assistant U.S. attorney apparently intended that he never \nbe given a full picture of the defendant's conduct,\" Hakes said. \nBut nine months later, in September 2007, Villafaria was in the throes of thorny \nnegotiations with Epstein's lawyers. While an FBI investigation was ongoing, \nVillafaria discussed ways to quietly resolve the case, emails show. \nA Miami Herald investigation, -Perversion of Justice,\" published in November, \nrevealed how federal prosecutors, including Acosta and Villafaria, tried to keep the \nfull scope of Epstein's crimes out of the public eye. At one point, they discussed \ncharging Epstein in Miami, instead of Palm Beach where the crimes happened, \nnoting there would be less media coverage. \nEmails also show that prosecutors repeatedly abided by Epstein's lawyers' demands \nthat his victims not be told that an agreement had been reached until after he was \nsentenced. That meant that the girls could not appear at the hearing to derail the \ndeal. Prosecutors had drafted a 53-page federal indictment on sex trafficking \ncharges, but Acosta instead allowed Epstein to plead guilty to two prostitution \ncharges in state court. In exchange, Epstein and his co-conspirators were given \nfederal immunity. \nVillafaria wrote Epstein's lawyer, Jay Lefkowitz, to discuss the wording of the \nsentencing agreement for the judge: \n\"I will include all our standard language regarding resolving all criminal liability and \nI will mention co-conspirators, but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of \nthe other crimes and all the other persons we could charge,\" Villafaria wrote. \nAt Epstein's sentencing, assistant Palm Beach prosecutor Lanna Belohlavek was \nquestioned by the judge about whether all of Epstein's victims were told about the \ndeal, as required by law. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021747 \n\"Are there more than one victim?\" Circuit Court Judge Deborah Dale Pucillo asked \nBelohlavek at the June 30, 2008 sentencing. \n\"There's several,\" Belohlavek replied. \n\"Are all the victims in both these cases in agreement with the terms of the plea?\" the \njudge asked. \n\"Yes,\" Belohlavek said. \nCoincidentally, the lawyer representing one of the victims was in the courtroom that \nday. He told the Herald that neither he, nor his client, was told about the agreement. \nAcosta has not responded to the Herald's repeated requests for comment. A \nspokesman at the Labor Department told the Washington Post last month: \"The \noffice's decisions were approved by departmental leadership and followed \ndepartmental procedures.\" \nIn the past, Acosta has said that he believed the deal was the best chance \nprosecutors had of ensuring that Epstein spent some time behind bars and was \nrequired to register as a sex offender. Epstein served 13 months in the Palm Beach \nCounty jail — but he was allowed to leave for up to 12 hours a day as part of a work \nrelease program not normally offered to convicted sex offenders. \nEpstein's victims, now in their late 20S and 30s, are fighting to have his deal \noverturned and Epstein sent to prison. \nBradley Edwards, who represents several of Epstein's victims, defended Villafaria, \nsaying he believed that she was directed to settle the case and not inform Epstein's \nvictims about the deal. \n\"In my conversations with her, I came to believe that she was in a difficult position. \nShe never came out and said this, but I suspected that someone above her directed \nher to do what she did,\" Edwards said. \nDARREN K.

He worked as\nan editorial writer and film reviewer for the Washington Times;\na reporter and later op-ed editor for The Wall Street Journal;\n\na senior editor at The Weekly Standard from its inception; a\ncontributing editor at Newsweek and The Atlantic Monthly;\n\nand as a commentator on National Public Radio. He is\n\nnow a columnist for The New York Times and commentator\n\non PBS NewsHour.\n\nBrooks, who is Jewish, was born in Toronto,\nCanada—his father was a U.S. citizen living in Canada at the\ntime—and grew up in New York City in Stuyvesant Town. He\ngraduated from Grace Church School in New York City, Radnor\nHigh School (located in a Main Line suburb of Philadelphia)\nin 1979 and from the University of Chicago, with a degree\nin history, in 1983.\n\nBrooks edited a 1996 anthology of writings by\nnew conservative writers, Backward and Upward: The New\nConservative Writing. He wrote a book of cultural commentary\ntitled Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They\nGot There, published in 2000, and followed it four years later\nwith On Paradise Drive: How We Live Now (And Always Have)\nin the Future Tense.\n\nHe also authored The Social Animal: The Hidden\nSources of Love, Character and Achievement. The book was\nexcerpted in The New Yorker magazine in January 2011\nand received mixed reviews upon its full publication, by\nRandom House, in March of that year. The book has been a\ncommercial success, reaching the #3 spot on the Publishers\nWeekly best-sellers list for non-fiction in April 2011.\n\nBrooks was a visiting professor of public policy at\nDuke University’s Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy, and\nhe taught an undergraduate seminar there in the fall of 2006.\n\nHe and his wife live in the Cleveland Park\nneighborhood of Northwest Washington, DC.\n\nBrooks describes himself as being originally a liberal\nbefore “coming to my senses.” In 1983, he wrote a parody\nof conservative pundit William F. Buckley Jr., which said\n“Tn the afternoons he is in the habit of going into crowded\nrooms and making everybody else feel inferior. The evenings\nare reserved for extended bouts of name-dropping.”\n\nBuckley admired the parody and offered Brooks\najob with National Review. A turning point in Brooks’s\nthinking came later that year in a televised debate with\nMilton Friedman, which, as Brooks describes it, “was\nessentially me making a point, and he making a two-\nsentence rebuttal which totally devastated my point.”\n\nBefore the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Brooks argued\nforcefully for American military intervention, echoing the\nbelief of commentators and political figures that American\nand British forces would be welcomed as liberators. In the\nspring of 2004, some of his opinion pieces suggested that\nhe had tempered his earlier optimism about the war.\n\nBrooks’ public writing about the U.S. wars in\nAfghanistan and Iraq is similar to those by neoconservatives,\naccording to a Salon article by Glenn Greenwald, that labels\nBrooks as a neoconservative. His angry dismissal of the\nconviction of Scooter Libby as being “a farce” and having “no\n\nsignificance” was derided by political blogger Andrew Sullivan.\n\nOn August 10, 2006, Brooks wrote a column for The\nNew York Times titled “Party No. 3”. The column proposed\nthe idea of the McCain-Lieberman Party, or the fictional\nrepresentation of the fictional moderate majority in America.\n\nOttawa Citizen commentator David Warren has\nidentified Brooks as the sort of conservative pundit that\nliberals like, someone who is “sophisticated” and “engages\nwith” the liberal agenda, in contrast to a real conservative like\nCharles Krauthammer. Brooks has long been a supporter of\nJohn McCain; however, he did not show a liking for McCain’s\n2008 running mate, Sarah Palin, calling her a “cancer” on\nthe Republican Party. He has referred to her as a “joke,”\nunlikely to ever win the Republican nomination. But he later\nadmitted during a CSPAN interview that he had gone too far\nin his previous “cancer” comments about Palin, which he\nregretted, and simply stated he was not a fan of her values.\n\nIn a March 2007 article published in The New\nYork Times titled “No U-Turns”, Brooks explained that the\nRepublican Party must distance itself from the minimal-\ngovernment conservative principles that had arisen\nduring the Abraham Lincoln, Barry Goldwater, Ronald\nReagan and Calvin Coolidge eras. He claims that these\ncore concepts had served their purposes and should\nno longer be embraced by Republicans in order to win\nelections, which he considers the most important purpose\nof a political party designed to serve the political class.\n\nBrooks has been a frequent admirer of President\nBarack Obama. In an August 2009 profile of Brooks, The\nNew Republic describes his first encounter with Obama, in the\nspring of 2005: “Usually when I talk to senators, while they\nmay know a policy area better than me, they generally don’t\nknow political philosophy better than me. I got the sense he\nknew both better than me. [...] remember distinctly an image\nof—we were sitting on his couches, and I was looking at his\npant leg and his perfectly creased pant, and I’m thinking,\n\na) he’s going to be president and b) he’ll be a very good\npresident.” Two days after Obama’s second autobiography,\n\nThe Audacity of Hope, hit bookstores, Brooks published a\ncolumn in The New York Times, titled “Run, Barack, Run”,\nurging the Chicago politician to run for president. However as\nof December 2011 in a CSPAN interview, Brook’s opinion of\nObama’s presidency was more tempered, giving Obama only\na “B-” rating, and said that Obama’s chances of reelection\nwould be less than 50-50 if elections were held at that time.\n\nIn writing for The New York Times in January 2010,\nBrooks described Israel as “an astonishing success story”.\nHe wrote that “Jews are a famously accomplished group,”\nwho, because they were “forced to give up farming in the\nMiddle Ages... have been living off their wits ever since”. In\nBrooks’ view, “Israel’s technological success is the fruition\nof the Zionist dream. The country was not founded so stray\nsettlers could sit among thousands of angry Palestinians\nin Hebron. It was founded so Jews would have a safe place\nto come together and create things for the world.”\n\nBrooks opposes what he sees as self-destructive\nbehavior, such as teenage sex and divorce. His view is that\n“sex is more explicit everywhere barring real life. As the\nentertainment media have become more sex-saturated,\nAmerican teenagers have become more sexually abstemious”\nby “waiting longer to have sex...[and] having fewer partners.”\nHe sees the culture war as nearly over, because “today’s\nyoung people...seem happy with the frankness of the left\nand the wholesomeness of the right.” As a result, he\nis optimistic about the United States’ social stability,\nwhich he considers to be “in the middle of an\namazing moment of improvement and repair.”\n\nBrooks also broke with many in the conservative\nmovement when, in late 2003, he came out in favor of same-\nsex marriage in his New York Times column. He equated\nthe idea with traditional conservative values: “We should\ninsist on gay marriage. We should regard it as scandalous\nthat two people could claim to love each other and not\nwanit to sanctify their love with marriage and fidelity...\n\nIt’s going to be up to conservatives to make the important,\nmoral case for marriage, including gay marriage.”\n\nRegarding abortion, Brooks has advocated for\npro-choice government regulations: abortion should be\nlegal, with parental consent for minors, during the first four\nor five months, and illegal afterward, except in extremely\nrare circumstances.

For example, in June 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported that Xi\nwarned a group of global CEOs that China would retaliate with “qualitative measures”\ntargeted at their companies, if the United States did not back off from the tariff war.**\nSecond, China is seeking to pressure American companies into legitimizing its geopolitical\nclaims and interests, for example by demanding that Western firms overtly acknowledge\nthat Taiwan is an irreversible part of China. Third, China has wooed American companies\nwith both sticks and carrots into serving its strategic interests abroad, most notably via its\ninteractions with Hollywood.\n\nChina’s source of leverage over American companies comes from its large domestic market\nand its key role in international supply chains; by contrast, China holds little direct\nownership in American companies. American affiliates (i.e., those at least half-owned by\nAmerican multinational companies) employ 1.7 million Chinese workers and are indirectly\nresponsible for the employment of millions more.* More than fifty American companies\nreport that they generate at least 20 percent of their revenues from China.*° Naturally,\nmany companies (and industry associations) with large stakes in China lobby the American\ngovernment on issues related to China, often seeking to exert a moderating influence on US\npolicy. This is not in itself evidence of improper influence, but it merits scrutiny and should\nbe weighed in the context of other evidence in this section.”\n\nSeeking to Influence American Politics via Corporate Interests\n\nChina does, in fact, exert influence on how at least some American companies and\ncorporate executives interact with the American government. This influence generally\ntakes two forms. In the first, China relies on American corporations to retard efforts by the\nAmerican government to investigate and sanction Chinese behavior deemed harmful to\nnational economic or strategic interests. For example, some American corporations have\nexpressed reservations about cooperating with US trade investigations for fear of retaliation\nby China.\n\nChinese officials also regularly convene senior American executives at special meetings\nwith government officials or major conferences. During these engagements, Western\nCEOs’ positive comments on the country receive wide play in the foreign and domestic\nmedia, one of many ways in which the Party continues to seek the appearance of outside\nlegitimization for domestic purposes. In addition, China uses these meetings to attempt to\ncoerce American executives to take China’s side in disputes with the US government. As\nthe risk of a trade war mounted in spring 2018, Chinese officials explicitly warned gathered\nexecutives to lobby the US government to back down or risk disruption to their business\nin China.** The US government does not strategically convene foreign business leaders, let\nalone instruct them to use their influence to shape policy favorable to the United States in\ntheir home countries.\n\nCorporations\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020569\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

You know what the Seventh Sense is now. Who among them has it?\nWe should wonder if we’ve merely now done Hiram Maxim one better: Have we\ndeveloped something with our age of connection that will reach its fullest potential\nin allowing us to slit each other’s throats more efficiently? I don’t think so, but\nunderstanding why means we need consider the networks, to feel them out with our\nnew sense.\n\nThe essential problem of politics is not difficult to state. It was true for Seneca in the\nRoman Forum as it was for Lobengula on the Shangani riverbank or is now for\ncongressmen in Washington or cadres is Beijing: Who has power? Why? By power |\nmean the ability to control others, to tell them what to do - or what not to do; and of\ncourse to avoid being dictated to yourself in that “Surrender or die” way. Max\nWeber, the German sociologist of the last century, had it right: Macht, the ability to\nachieve what you want despite the resistance of others.22? Don’t develop nuclear\nweapons. Or Don’t attack us. Or, Join our alliance against Sparta are all examples of\npower in action. The movement of power, from the balled-up fists of Kings and\nPopes and Emperors, to the hands of markets and voters and citizens, and now into\na fresh, connected dynamic is the story of history. This is a lurching, worrisome,\ndangerous process even if it suggests some miraculous transformations. Whole new\ntopologies of vital, life-giving control are emerging; surely contests for their mastery\nwill occur. The terrible human infection of a hunger for power and security isn't,\nmuch as we might wish, something quarantined safely to the pages of Homer or\nHitler.\n\nSo let’s pass beyond describing the new and surprising elements that make up a\nSeventh Sense and onto its use. Examine our world with this instinct, for a moment.\nPicture that constantly stretched, complex network, spitting out drones, viruses,\nfortunes and disruption as it is wont to do. Recall the seething, insidious power of\nthe Warez Dudes, the New Caste, the black boxes they all hunger to penetrate and\nmake weird. Think of the compression of time, of twisting topologies that can place\nthe distant atop us in an instant. What single feature stands out? Our world shuffles\nnow, as all these forces slip into an order defined by closed spaces, by fresh in and\nout borders. What the Seventh Sense reveals as it feels at this new arrangement is\ngates. Everywhere. Facebook, bitcoin users, doctors with privileged access to\ngenetic databases - all are gated, in-or-out worlds.

The search through\nprocedure space could be conducted as a form of evolution, via an algorithm such as\nMOSES.\n\ne Autopoiesis: the process by which a system of interrelated patterns maintains its integrity,\nvia a dynamic in which whenever one of the patterns in the system begins to decrease in\nintensity, some of the other patterns increase their intensity in a manner that causes the\ntroubled pattern to increase in intensity again\n\n— Example: An agent’s set of strategies for building the base of a tower, and its set of\nstrategies for building the middle part of a tower, are likely to relate autopoietically. If\nthe system partially forgets how to build the base of a tower, then it may regenerate\nthis missing knowledge via using its knowledge about how to build the middle part\n(i.e., it knows it needs to build the base in a way that will support good middle parts).\nSimilarly if it partially forgets how to build the middle part, then it may regenerate this\nmissing knowledge via using its knowledge about how to build the base (i.e. it knows a\ngood middle part should fit in well with the sorts of base it knows are good).\n\n— This same sort of interdependence occurs between pattern-sets containing more than\ntwo elements\n\n— Sometimes (as in the above example) autopoietic interdependence in the mind is tied\nto interdependencies in the physical world, sometimes not.\n\ne Association. Patterns, when given attention, spread some of this attention to other pat-\nterns that they have previously been associated with in some way. Furthermore, there is\nPeirce’s law of mind [Pei34], which could be paraphrased in modern terms as stating that\nthe mind is an associative memory network, whose dynamics dictate that every idea in\nthe memory is an active agent, continually acting on those ideas with which the memory\nassociates it.\n\n— Example: Building a blocks structure that resembles a tower, spreads attention to mem-\nories of prior towers the agents has seen, and also to memories of people the agent knows\nhave seen towers, and structures it has built at the same time as towers, structures that\nresemble towers in various respects, etc.\n\ne Differential attention allocation / credit assignment. Patterns that have been valu-\nable for goal-achievement are given more attention, and are encouraged to participate in\ngiving rise to new patterns.\n\n— Example: Perhaps in a prior instance of the task “build me a surprising structure out of\nblocks,” searching through memory for non-blocks structures that the agent has played\nwith has proved a useful cognitive strategy. In that case, when the task is posed to the\nagent again, it should tend to allocate disproportionate resources to this strategy.\n\ne Pattern creation. Patterns that have been valuable for goal-achievement are mutated and\ncombined with each other to yield new patterns.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012954\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I couldn’t help wondering\nwhether, despite our nearly daily exercises, and my nightly stock-taking, I'd\nsomehow missed an obvious detail in our planning. When we got back to the\nsayeret base, Avraham was waiting for us. “Well?” he asked Meir. “They don’t\nneed me,” he said. “They know what they’re doing.” It was not just a source of\nreassurance for me, but a huge relief for Avraham.\n\nThe team I’d inherited from Tubul included three gifted soldiers with\ndifferent backgrounds, and different skills. Motti Nagar was born in Cairo. He\nwas short but solidly built, smart, level-headed and almost always smiling. Kuti\nSharabi grew up in a Yemeni family in an impoverished neighborhood in Tel\nAviv. He had a self-deprecating sense of humor, a quick mind and sometimes\neven quicker tongue, but an extraordinary ability to focus on the task at hand.\nThe third member was a kibbutznik. His name was Moshe Elimelech. We called\nhim Moshiko. Utterly self-contained, a man who spoke only when absolutely\nnecessary, he also brought two different qualities to the mission. One was going\nto be indispensable: an almost squirrel-like ability to climb trees. Or telephone\npoles. The other, of which I was a bit more leery, was a total, deeply irrational,\nabsence of fear.\n\nThough none of us needed a further reminder of the weight being attached to\nour mission, the night before we headed north, Avraham got a call from the\nchief-of- staff's office. Tzvi Tzur wanted to see me the next morning for a\npersonal briefing. I tried to get Avraham to say no. I pointed out that if we\ndidn’t get going by ten o’clock at the latest, we’d risk throwing everything off\nschedule. But “no” was not an option. After some further back-and-forth, it was\nagreed that I would meet the commander of Israel’s armed forces at nine the\nnext morning at a gas station north of Tel Aviv and join him for the 20-minute\ndrive along the coastal road to a speaking engagement he had in Netanya.\n\nI saw Avraham again before I set off. “We are beginning an extremely\ncritical 24 hours for our unit, the intelligence corps, in fact for the armed forces\nas a whole,” he told me. “I don’t know what might happen. No one does. Just\nremember two things. First, out there, in the field, you are the ramatkal” — the\nchief of staff. He told me that only I and my team could judge and respond to\nwhat we encountered once the operation started. “And second, this mission has\nto be accomplished.”\n\nI left see the real ramatkal. Before we began the drive to Netanya, he asked\nme to unfold the map I'd brought with me and talk him through, step by step,\nhow we planned to get onto the Golan, plant the bugging device, and get back\n\n66\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027914\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

These\ndifferent approaches all overlap substantially, which is good, yet each gives a slightly different\nslant.\n\n2.3.1 Competencies Characterizing Human-like Intelligence\n\nFirst we give a list of key competencies characterizing human level intelligence resulting from\nthe the AGI Roadmap Workshop held at the University of Knoxville in October 2008 ', which\nwas organized by Ben Goertzel and Itamar Arel. In this list, each broad competency area is\nlisted together with a number of specific competencies sub-areas within its scope:\n\nPerception: vision, hearing, touch, proprioception, crossmodal\n\nActuation: physical skills, navigation, tool use\n\nMemory: episodic, declarative, behavioral\n\nLearning: imitation, reinforcement, interactive verbal instruction, written media, experi-\nmentation\n\nReasoning: deductive, abductive, inductive, causal, physical, associational, categorization\nPlanning: strategic, tactical, physical, social\n\nAttention: visual, social, behavioral\n\nMotivation: subgoal creation, affect-based motivation, control of emotions\n\nEmotion: expressing emotion, understanding emotion\n\nSelf: self-awareness, self-control, other-awareness\n\nSocial: empathy, appropriate social behavior, social communication, social inference, group\nplay, theory of mind\n\n12. Communication: gestural, pictorial, verbal, language acquisition, cross-modal\n\n13. Quantitative: counting, grounded arithmetic, comparison, measurement\n\n14. Building/Creation: concept formation, verbal invention, physical construction, social\ngroup formation\n\nBwN\n\nFHSS ONS oH\n\n—_ao\n\nClearly this list is getting at the same things as the textbook headings given in Section 2.2,\nbut with a different emphasis due to its origin among AGI researchers rather than cognitive\n\n1 See http: //www.ece.utk.edu/~itamar/AGI_Roadmap. html; participants included: Sam Adams, IBM\nResearch; Ben Goertzel, Novamente LLC; Itamar Arel, University of Tennessee; Joscha Bach, Institute of Cogni-\ntive Science, University of Osnabruck, Germany; Robert Coop, University of Tennessee; Rod Furlan, Singularity\nInstitute; Matthias Scheutz, Indiana University; J.

The survival rate of such individuals in\nJamaica (where 10% of the population have a sickle gene and 1% two copies) is 57\nyears, a good 10+ years below normal—nor is life pleasant or easy. This is the only\ncrudity in the same, the failure to ameliorate the negative effects of two copies.\n\nIt is correct as Peter says, that relatively recent human invasion by malaria\n(~10,000 years ago) was probably in response to large population increases due to\nagriculture and so on. This short time period has also prevented much selection to\nameliorate the sickle cell disease. It is not true, however, that “it and many other\ncrude adaptations” result from the “ability of the malarial parasites to outwit the\nimmune system”. First of all, other “adaptations” are no more crude than the sickle\ntrait. For example, the Duffy antigen, a surface protein on red blood cells, is designed\nto spot Plasmodium and prevent entry. And the parasite does not “outwit the\nimmune system”. It is one of the very few Protozoa (or for that matter bacteria) that\nlive WITHIN cells and thus escape the immune system entirely (except see below).\nViruses live inside cells, precisely why we can’t use antibiotics against them.\n\nAnd here is a joke for you. Bacteria, as we know, are rapidly evolving resistance to\nalmost all antibiotics but on many tips of the branches of the bacterial bush, species\nare evolving that DEPEND on antibiotics for their food—stop treating them with\nantibiotics and they die of hunger!\n\nPlasmodium reproduces within its red blood cell and the offspring are released into\nthe blood as the cell bursts. Now the immune system responds strongly and all hell\nbreaks loose, fever and chills, bed-ridden and sometimes dead. When given a choice,\nmosquitos preferentially bite sick people, perhaps because they are too weak to\nswat the mosquitos away. Once in a mosquito, they do nothing to harm it other than\ncongregate in its mouth near the biting organ, the better to arrive new human.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029160\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Air Force One \nView this email in your browser here. \nChart of the Day - Economy and Society \nJune 27, 2016 \nDear Barry, \nWhen it comes to describing Donald Trump's private jet, the word \n\"impressive\" would be an understatement. The presumptive Republican Party \nnominee bought the Boeing 757-200 from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen \nand he spared no expense kitting it out. Dubbed \"Trump Force One,\" the \nluxurious jet is equipped with a shower, gold-plated seatbelt buckles and a \n52-inch flatscreen with a library of 1,000 movies. Built in 1991, the 757 is \nestimated to have cost approximately $100 million. If Trump reaches the \nWhite House in November, he'll have to exchange his personal jet for the \npresidential fleet, two highly modified Boeing 747-200Bs. The aircraft used by \nthe president were built in 1986 and operate with the Air Force One callsign \nwhen the president is onboard. Will switching jets prove one of Trump's few \nregrets if he becomes president? \nEven though it cannot boast gold-plated accessories, Air Force One is a \nlarger aircraft, seating 70 passengers in comfort compared to Trump Force \n..11141, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033301 \nOne's 43. The presidential jet is also slightly faster with a range of about \n6,800 nautical miles compared to 4,100 for a 757. A VC-25A can also be \nrefuelled in mid-air by a tanker, extending its range even further. \nThe two presidential planes cost $325 million each and their cost of operation \ncomes to $179,750 per hour. The hourly cost of operation for a standard 757 \nis just over $8,000 by comparison, though the taxpayer will pick up the higher \nbill for Air Force One. All that bling certainly inflated the cost of Trump Force \nOne but Air Force One is expensive because it's packed with equipment and \nfacilities to keep the president and his or her entourage safe at all times. \nThere is a hospital onboard, electronic countermeasures and heavy shielding \nto afford protection in the event of an electromagnetic pulse during a nuclear \nattack. All in all, if Trump does end up travelling regularly on Air Force One, \nhe probably won't regret trading in his gold seatbelt buckle for the presidential \nsuite on one of the most sophisticated airliners in the world. \nhttps://www.statista.com/chart/5110/trump-force-one-vs-air-force-one/ \n+++ Advertisement ++ \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033302 \n6 Best Practices for Creating Effective Dashboards \nIf you're not using interactive dashboards to make fast data-driven decisions, \nyou're missing out!

As early as May\n24, 2013, Snowden had suggested to Gellman that he was making arrangements with a foreign\ngovernment. To that end, he asked Gellman to insert an encrypted key in Internet version of the\nNSA expose that Snowden proposed he write for the Washington Post. He told him the purpose\nof the encrypted key was to assist him with a foreign government. Snowden did not identify that\nforeign government to Gellman so Gellman knew that Snowden wanted to “seek asylum”\noverseas. He decided against assisting him. “I can’t help him evade U.S. jurisdiction—I don’t\nwant to, and I can’t,” he later explained. “It’s not my job. It’s not the relationship. Iam a\njournalist.”\n\nAlthough Gellman suspected that Iceland might be the foreign government in question,\nSnowden, as it turned, had not ever contacted the consulate of Iceland while he was in Hong\nKong. “We had heard nothing from Snowden,” an Iceland government official told Vanity\nFair.\n\nSnowden also did not contact the government of Ecuador in Hong Kong. In late June,\nwhile Harrison was laying down false tracks for Snowden in Hong Kong, Assange in London\nasked Fidel Narvaez, who was a friend of his and the legal attaché in the London embassy of\nEcuador, to issue a document that Snowden could use. But this document was not delivered to\nSnowden in Hong Kong (and later it was invalidated by Ecuador.) If Snowden had really\nplanned to go to Ecuador from Moscow, it would require him first going to Cuba. Cuba did not\neven require a U.S. passport (as, in 2013, U.S, citizens were not supposed to travel to Cuba.) He\ndid require a Cuban travel document, which he could have obtained from the Cuban consulate\nany time during his month in Hong Kong. Yet he did not ever obtain it. Nor did he acquire a\nvisa to go to any other country in Latin America or elsewhere. So where was he headed?\n\nWhatever foreign government with which Snowden was dealing earlier in May presumably did\nnot have an extradition treaty with the United States. Yet few other foreign governments, which\ndid not have active extradition treaties with the United States, could be directly reached by air.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020262\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

For-\nty-four people in the study were given everolimus in a\nlast-ditch attempt to slow down or stop their advanced\ncancer. When the researchers analyzed the data, they\ncould see that the drug wasn’t slowing or stopping\ntumor growth. Everolimus seemed to be another bust.\nThen there was patient number 45. She joined the\ntrial with advanced metastatic cancer. Tumors had\ninvaded deep into her abdomen, clouding her CT scan\nwith solid grey blotches. She was 73 years old. None of\nthe standard bladder cancer drugs were working for\nher anymore; she had “failed treatment,” in the dismal\nlingo of oncologists. She enrolled in the study only\nbecause she happened to be a patient at Sloan-Ketter-\ningin January 2010. In April 2010, her cancer was gone.\nThis sort of happy surprise is not unheard of\n\nin drug studies. Bodies are fluky, each with its own\n\nidiosyncratic combination of genetic blueprints and\n\nJ\n\nenvironmental inputs. So sometimes a patient will be\ncured by a drug that is useless for everyone else. In\nthe past, these spectacular reactions were written off\nas outlier responses that defied explanation—medical\nmysteries. Doctors just shrugged their shoulders and\nthanked their lucky stars that even though the study\ntanked, they did manage to help one person.\n\nBut this time was different. Clinical oncologist\nDavid Solit, director of developmental therapeutics\nat Sloan-Kettering, saw a new opportunity to explain\nwhat happened by sequencing the whole genome of\nthe woman’s cancer. Just five years ago, decoding and\nanalyzing all 3 billion bases of the DNA from a tumor\nwould’ve been absurdly time-consuming and expen-\nsive. Now the sequencing takes as little as a few days.\n\nPoring over the outlier patient’s genetic code, Solit\npinpointed two mutations that made her tumor sensi-\ntive to this drug. He found that one of her mutations\nshows up in about 8 to 10 percent of other bladder can-\ncer patients, meaning that they too might be helped\nby everolimus. His success has inspired a whole set of\n\nILLUSTRATION BY ELLEN WEINSTEIN\n\n36\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015496\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It allows victims the “rea-\nsonable right” to confer with the\nU.S. attorneys handling the case.\n\nThe deal reached between Acos-\nta and Epstein’s attorneys allowed\nhim to not be prosecuted in fed-\neral court, and instead sentenced\nin state court. The immunity from\nprosecution also extended to some\nof Epstein’s co-conspirators.\n\nEpstein pleaded guilty to two\nprostitution charges and served 13\nmonths in county jail, according\nto the Miami Herald.

I told her how extraordinary it felt to have the prospect, at\nleast, of leading Labor in opposition to Bibi, without the need to confront, or to\ninflict personal hurt, on Shimon. But I added: “It seems a bit too good to be true.”\n\nIt was. The next morning, I joined other ministers and party officials with Peres\nin his office. It was as if our conversation a few hours before had never happened.\nShimon set out his strategy for Labor going forward. And the first thing he said\nwas that the party needed to push back any leadership election beyond the\nmandated 14 months.“It’s too early,” he said. He said we needed to focus on two\nother strategic imperatives: to reconstruct the party, and consider the issue of\njoining a possible “unity” government with Bibi.\n\nThough Bibi went on to form his government without us, in alliance with a\nnumber of smaller Orthodox parties, the idea of a Labor leadership change seemed\noff the agenda, at least for now. In early August, I was standing next to Giora Einy\n— the “political operative” Yitzhak had sent to help bring me into his government,\nand a friend of Peres as well — when Shimon rose to speak to the dozens of well-\nwishers at his 73\"-birthday celebration in Tel Aviv. He was at his old, self-\nconfident best. With just a few thousand extra votes, we would have won the\nelection, he said. He was sure Bibi’s coalition — “a coalition against peace” —\nwould not survive for long. Giora, smiling, turned to me and said: “It doesn’t\nsound like a farewell speech. It seems like he’s ready for the next round. He lost\ntwice to Begin. He lost once to Shamir. And only once to Bibi. He’s not going to\nstop without giving it another go.”\n\nAnother of Peres’s old friends, a few weeks later, urged me to press him on the\nneed to step aside. I’d become closer to the French Jewish businessman Jean\nFrydman during the election campaign. Since he had helped organize the fateful\npeace rally at which Rabin was shot, he felt — wrongly, but powerfully — a sense of\nresponsibility for what had happened. He wanted to do everything possible to\nensure that Rabin’s political legacy, and Shimon’s, survived. He invited Nava and\nme to visit him for a few days. When he asked about the birthday celebration, I\ntold him what Peres had said. “He’s making a huge mistake,” Jean told me. “After\nevery election, he goes through the same process. Always, he’s convinced that next\ntime he will win.” I said how I dreaded the prospect of being part of an effort to\n\n296\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011767\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

How am I supposed to play\n“Yonkers My Yonkers’ with all that bellowing in my ears!” It was the most exciting thing I had ever seen.\n\nI was a melancholic child. Worried, anxious. I never felt as if I belonged anywhere, as if I were a foreign\nexchange student living among the other kids, who seemed predestined to love sports. Add to that alienation the\nfact that my parents were going through a divorce, and I was truly treading water. But in that junior high school\nauditorium, I felt like ’'d discovered a secret I didn’t even know was being whispered. There was a place where\nI might belong: It was the Theater, and I was sold.\n\nA few years later, at Stagedoor Manor in Loch Sheldrake, N.Y., I joined an intensive theater boot camp for kids\njust like me. The second I stepped off the bus, I felt like baby Simba when he’s lifted into the air in “The Lion\nKing” and all the animals sing. Everyone was affectionate; everyone hugged; no was called “gay” for doing\nanything that wasn’t masculine. (My insecurity about this had shamefully kept me from doing theater in\nschool.) It was utopia, and I never wanted to leave.\n\nFrom left, Helene Yorke, Zach Braff and Lenny Wolpe in the musical “Bullets Over Broadway.” Credit Sara\nKrulwich/The New York Times\n\nIt was there I met Michael Larsen, the musical director of the camp. He told me that I wasn’t just a camper\nhaving fun, but that I also had talent. And he was tough — sometimes he’d scream at me — but I knew it was\nbecause he thought I had a shot. (Michael was the first of many gay men instrumental in guiding me to where I\nam now, which is why I try to speak on behalf of gay rights whenever I can. But I suppose that’s a different\nessay.)\n\nAt 18, I was cast as Woody Allen and Diane Keaton’s son in the film “Manhattan Murder Mystery,” my first\nmovie role. And now, after studying film and theater at Northwestern University, playing J. D. on “Scrubs” on\nTV for nine years and directing two films, I’m working with Woody Allen again. I’m typing these words in my\ndressing room at the St. James Theater, where on April 10 Pll open in “Bullets Over Broadway,” a musical\nadaptation of his hit film. I play David Shayne, a struggling writer in 1929 New York who agrees to cast a\nmobster’s ditsy girlfriend in one of his plays in order to get it produced.\n\nThe St. James is where Yul Brynner opened in “The King and I” in 1951; where hits like “Oklahoma!,” “The\nPajama Game,” “Gypsy,” “The Who’s Tommy,” and “The Producers” played, and where, in 1964, by the most\nsurreal of coincidences, Carol Channing first descended an endless staircase in “Hello, Dolly!” I sit in Dressing\nRoom 201, where many of the great luminaries of the Broadway stage — Patti LuPone, Nathan Lane, Mandy\nPatinkin — have paced waiting for the intercom to chime, “Places for Act I, please.” This is the sanctuary that a\nlittle invisible boy in New Jersey dreamed he’d one day find.\n\nZach Braff in a 1988 production of \"Godspell\" at Stagedoor Manor.

I would be both Defense Minister and “Vice-Prime Minister’,\nwith the understanding that Bibi and I would jointly discuss all major issues before\njointly agreeing to bring them to the full cabinet.\n\nBut in August, the talks ended, after news of our talks finally leaked.

Although\nI’d learn of this only a few years later, he’d approved a visit to Damascus by the\nAmerican Jewish businessman Ronald Lauder to meet President Assad. The visit\nmade it clear to Bibi what successive Israeli leaders had learned: a deal might be\npossible, but only if Israel was willing to commit in advance to pulling out of the\nGolan. Assad told Lauder to come back to him with a detailed map setting out\nBibi’s view on delineating the Israeli-Syrian border under a peace agreement.\nThough no one in the cabinet knew the initiative was underway, Bibi realized that\nbefore sending back the map Assad wanted, he would need to tell the two senior\nministers directly affected: Arik Sharon, who had replaced David Levy as Foreign\nMinister; and Yitzhik Mordechai. Both of them said no, with Yitzhik pointing out\nthat a signed map would inevitably become part of the negotiating record. It was a\nstep that, in future negotiations, could not be undone.\n\nBibi’s coalition was now creaking. The Syrian option was off. David Levy had\nalready jumped ship. Yitzhik, increasingly concerned about Bibi’s delay and drift\non Oslo II, seemed to be thinking of leaving as well.

My “girlfriend”\nin the film—a mostly fictional character played by Annabella Sciorra—complains loudly that my\ncharacter has nothing left for the people around him, and my character seems to agree: “My\nclients are the people I care about.” Poor guy! I hope that’s not me, although I do have to\nacknowledge that people who know me only professionally assume that I have nothing left for\nthose I love. But the fact is that I reserve a lot of love, loyalty and friendship for family and\npeople close to me.\n\nI asked Ron Silver—who knows how important my family and friends are to me—how he felt\nplaying me in way that he knew was something of a stereotype of the passionate lawyer for\nwhom, Oliver Wendell Holmes’ said, “the law is a jealous mistress.” He responded: “I’m playing\nthe public Alan Dershowitz—the one people see on TV and in the newspapers. I can’t get to\nknow the private Alan well enough to play him, and frankly the public isn’t interested in that side\nof you.”\n\nIn this book, I will try to interest my readers in both sides of my life, and how each impacts the\nother, and how both are very much the products of my early upbringing and my lifelong\nexperiences. I think of myself as an integrated whole, though the very different roles I play—as\nlawyer, teacher, writer, father, husband, friend, colleague—require somewhat different balances\namong the various elements of my persona.\n\nAlthough this autobiography is my first attempt to explore my life in full, I have written several\nearlier books that touch on aspects of my public life. The Best Defense dealt with my earliest\ncases during the first decade of my professional life. Chutzpah covered my Jewish causes and\ncases. Reversal of Fortune and Reasonable Doubts each dealt with one specific case (Von Bulow\nand O.J. Simpson). I will try not to repeat what I wrote in those books, though some overlap is\ninevitable.

Steady-state growth would not be\n\naffected, but intermediate-run transitions would, and those should be observable.\n\nThat idea seemed to correspond to common sense, and it still does. By 1958 I was\nable to produce a model that allowed for the embodiment effect. ... If common sense\nwas right, the embodiment model should have fit the facts better than the earlier\none.

But Solow puzzled how embodied growth, which needs “new and different\n\ncapital equipment,” could arrive without “ a policy to increase investment.”\n\nIt can for the same reason that Achilles can overtake the tortoise. Solow’s problem, |\nthink, may have been that new and different capital equipment stands to embodied\nnovelty as a new and different chicken laying a new and different egg. We can see\nhow the different capital might come first through saving from consumption\ndeferment. And it seems clear that the embodied novelty could not. But one of the\nbeauties of calculus is that it allows chicken and egg to evolve simultaneously.\n\nNeither novelty precedes the other at the instant of first embodiment.\nThis time it is Newton and Leibnitz to the rescue, along with the trusty Gunnar\nMyrdal, if 1 guess right about Solow’s misgivings. Since he understands calculus and\n\nMyrdal far better than I do, I may guess wrong. So let me try another way.

We thus\nbelieve the regulator (CITC) regulator will have to consider further steps to afford\nmarket share to the second and third entrants including asymmetric competition\nmeasures (pricing, MTRs), license extensions or differentiated royalty rates.\n\nSTC the likely beneficiary of FTTH expansion\n\nWhilst we argue that STC could lose further market share in the Mobile market as a\nresult of regulatory moves, we believe the negative impact will be offset by growing\nrevenues from FTTH, IPTV and the corporate market. Indeed, we believe STC, given its\nmarket leading FTTH network and IPTV offering, will likely benefit most acutely from\nthe growth in the number of FTTH customers. Furthermore, with government grants\nlikely to be provided for FTTH roll out in less economical areas (as part of the NTP), we\nbelieve returns will likely not suffer from the additional capital deployment. Mobily could\nalso benefit (given its well-developed FTTH infrastructure), although we expect it to lag\nSTC who has a first mover advantage and arguably a stronger FTTH/Triple play offering.\n\nWe note, Zain KSA will unlikely participate in the rollout of the FTTH expansion given its\nconstrained balance sheet and strategic focus on the wireless market. That said, the\ncompany could benefit from the rollout of high speed internet solutions over its wireless\nnetwork (ie fixed broadband over its 4G network), particularly in areas where the\nconstruction of FTTH networks maybe be difficult or uneconomical.\n\nRoyalty rate increases unlikely, particularly for Zain KSA and Mobily\n\nAdmittedly, an increase in royalties could be an easy way of raising much needed\nrevenues for the government. After all, each 1% increase could raise income by more\napproximately SAR500mn (cUS$130mn). However, we would argue that this is unlikely\ngiven the lack of sufficient competition in the market and the obstacles to increased\ncompetition higher royalty rates would introduce. In the same vein, we also believe it\nhighly unlikely that the government would seek to introduce a fourth mobile operator\nlicense given the lack of sufficient market capacity between the second and third\noperators.\n\nReligious tourism a material opportunity for telecom providers\n\nSaudi Arabia’s ambitious growth targets for religious tourism provide a material\nopportunity for the telecom providers in our view. More specifically, if the number of\nreligious tourists (for Hajj and Umrah) increases by an estimated 10mn per annum by\n2020, we believe demand for roaming services (voice and data) and sim purchases will\nincrease significantly. Indeed, on our estimates, we see the 10mn visitors potentially\nproviding a SAR2bn-SAR4bn opportunity, representing a c4-8% uplift in total wireless\nrevenues for service providers. We particularly believe Zain KSA will benefit strongly\nfrom this given they provide the most competitive Pay as you go packages currently and\nhave the largest spare capacity on their network.\n\n50 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 3S Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016160\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I've just been. \nYou will never think the same way about anything again.\" \nSo spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up \neverywhere at the moment as the alleged \"procurer\" of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. \nEpstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of \nanother investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with \nallegations that he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British \nnewspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein's friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to \npublicly disassociate himself from his old pal. \nI wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called \"The Talented Mr. Epstein.\" It was largely a business piece that \nfocused on his mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les \nWexner, the chairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude \nHoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of \n$450 million. \nThe piece alluded to Epstein's great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women \nwith whom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the \nissue that remains a mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. \nThis is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I \nconcentrated on the intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same \nones, different ones. And their stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one \ncase, flown—to ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? And the British, especially, want to know: Who \nis she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, my 2003 Vanity Fairstory \nthat really brought him into the limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030467 \nBizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept \nrunning into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of \nyoung women with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. \"Do they speak?\" I remember \nasking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. \"Not like you,Vicky,\" was his riposte. \nI remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn't \nstudied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at \nhome via messenger. It was a book: \"Math for idiots.\" \nSo he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. \n\"Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects,\" newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He \nwas certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few \nmoments in his company and you know this to be true. \nWhen I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that \n\"Andy\"—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his \nstrange title is. Because if one thing's for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what \nhe's talking about far more than \"Andy\" does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other \nfinanciers hang out with him. \nAnd Ghislaine? \nFull disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It's almost impossible not to. \nShe is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hours \ntalking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is \ncurious. She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent \nme a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else's I can think of—probably even \nRupert Murdochs'. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill \nClinton with whom she is close friends. \nYet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-\nPlatero, (known fondly to her close friends as \"the Tennis Goddess\") Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When \nit comes down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability. \nAnd that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey. \n\"He saved her,\" I remember a close friend of mine telling me. \"When her father died, she was a wreck; \ninconsolable. And then Jeffrey took her in. She's never forgotten that—and never will.\" \nIn many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect \nreplacement for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his \nsexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine's father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving \na massive \"black hole\" he'd fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that \nstrange. \nIn fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful \npeople in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl \nissues, and moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You \ndon't tend to get to the top by being the world's most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett \ndidn't quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second \"wife\" for many years whose existence he \nhas been open about. \nSo what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her \nloyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look \nat Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire.

The point: some amazing events which look benign have unforeseen consequences. Will a pact of going for\ngrowth pay the freight of higher Federal debt in the long run? Hard to say; there are not a lot of examples to draw\n\nfrom. Economic theories and their associated debt bubbles don’t always work out as planned [a]. After WWII, the US\nalso faced a debt ratio of 80% of GDP. Austerity was not the answer back then; government receipts and outlays as a %\nof GDP did not change much during the 1950’s, and net debt was flat. So how did US debt/GDP fall from 80% to 46%\nin just ten years? Robust annualized real growth of more than 4.0%, and 2.0% inflation. However, unique economic\nconditions and productivity gains of the 1950’s (e.g., interstate highway, rebuilding of Europe and Japan) may not be\nrepeated, and the country was not headed into an entitlement time bomb. If the US does not experience a\ngrowth/productivity boom, the burden of higher debt could last for a generation or more. A pro-growth Administration\nwould probably help, but the difficulty lay in defining exactly what that means.\n\nIsn't it amazing? 1950's debt reduction was based on growth, not austerity\n\nNet debt [Net debt] Nominal/Real GDP (bn/ Outlays (%| Receipts (%\n| _|oxercor]' ton [cor en s2c0 uso | orcor) | orcor)\n| 1950) $219 16% 14%\n| 1951] = $214 es a 14% 16%\n| 1952 Royer $215 $349 $322 19% 19%\nBEE 59% $218 $373 $341 21% 19%\n| 1954Rt $224 $377 $343 19% 19%\nMos 57% $227 $396 $354 17% 17%\nMEGS: 352% $222 $427 $368 17% 18%\n| 1957 fete $219 $451 $377 17% 18%\nBGs: 49% $226 $460 $377 18% 17%\nBr 848% $235 $490 $398 19% 16%\n| 1960MEEE Lo $237 $519 $415 18% 18%\n\nComp. ann’l gr: 0.8% 6.6% 4.3%\n\nSource: OMB, BEA\n\nAre there debt vs austerity parallels at the state and local level?\nYes and no.

During the course of\nthe conversation, he surprisingly asked what I would do with the peace process if I were\nhim. I had just re-read his autobiography, Warrior, and answered: “Both as a soldier\nand as a politician, you have a history of being bold, daunting, daring and making\nsurprise moves. In that spirit, 1 would suggest that you dismantle the settlements and\npull your troops completely out of Gaza.” For a minute I worried that this would anger\nhim, but he answered very calmly. “I cannot do it.” I asked why. He said: “Because of\nthe harbor.” I replied, rather perplexed: “But there is no harbor in Gaza.” He said:\n“That’s not the point. They could build one if we left Gaza.” Then I realized that,\ncontrary to common opinion, Sharon had no ideological inhibitions about leaving\nGaza. His concerns were only about security. This gave me high hopes that he would\neventually do it. Three years of stalemate were to follow. And then in December 2003,\nout of the blue, Sharon made the sweeping and stunning pronouncement that Israel\nwould leave Gaza and end its occupation of the Strip.\n\nAriel Sharon deserves praise for withdrawing from Gaza.

One idea was a comprehensive\nand unified Arab approach which was first proposed in the Fahd Plan (1981), and later\nrefined in the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002. The latter peace proposal promoted by\nthen Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah al-Saud represented a unified shift in the Arab\nStates’ approach to Israel. Where there was once rejection, the Arab peace initiative\ncreated the possibility of universal recognition of the State of Israel. All 57 countries of\nthe Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) endorsed the initiative.\n\nThe aftermath of the Gulf War of 1991 opened new opportunities to address the\ncomplex issue of peace in the Middle East. This was the backdrop for the groundbreak-\ning Madrid Peace Conference, convened by the United States and the Soviet Union. It\nraised new hopes for peaceful resolution to the enduring conflicts of the region. The\nconference created an unprecedented platform for peace talks, based on the principle of\n“land for peace”. The Israelis would have to cede land to their Arab adversaries in\nreturn for peace and security. The Madrid formula for organizing such talks followed a\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023165\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The trip would\nstill take tens of thousands of years, but the group sees\nTin Tin less as a realistic science mission than as a\ntechnology demonstration.\n\nGoing Light: Solar Sails\n\nA solar sail, such as the one used by the Japanese\nIKAROS probe to Venus, does away with propel-\nlant and engines altogether. It exploits the physics of\nlight. Like anything else in motion, a light wave has\n\nBETA PRODUCT\n\nmomentum and push-\nes on whatever surface\nit strikes. The force is\nfeeble,\nnoticeable if you have\na large enough surface,\na low mass, and a lot\nof time.

To\nreach the velocity need-\ned to escape the solar\nsystem, the craft would\nfirst swoop toward\nthe sun, as close as it\ndared—inside the orbit\nof Mercury—to fill its\nsails with lusty sunlight.\n\nSuch sail craft could\nconceivably make the\ncrossing to Alpha Centauri in a thousand years. Sails\nare limited in speed by how close they can get to the\nsun, which, in turn, is limited by the sail material’s\ndurability. Gregory Matloff, a City University of New\nYork professor and longtime interstellar travel propo-\nnent, says the most promising potential material is gra-\nphene—ultrathin layers of carbon graphite.\n\nA laser or microwave beam could provide an even\nmore muscular push. In the mid-1980s, the doyen of\ninterstellar travel, Robert Forward, suggested piggy-\nbacking on an idea popular at the time: solar-power\nsatellites, which would collect solar energy in orbit\nand beam it down to Earth by means of microwaves.\nBefore commencing operation, an orbital power sta-\ntion could pivot and beam its power up rather than\ndown. A 10-gigawatt station could accelerate an ultra-\nlight sail—a mere 16 grams—to one-fifth the speed of\nlight within a week. Two decades later, we’d start see-\ning live video from Alpha Centauri.\n\nThis “Starwisp” scheme has rts dubious features—it\nwould require an enormous lens, and the sail is so frag-\nile that the beam would be as likely to fry it as to push\nit—but it showed that we could reach the stars within\n\nbut becomes\n\na human lifetime.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015469\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This regulatory framework does not affect skincare,\ncosmetics or topicals with CBD or hemp ingredients.\n\n2\n\nEurope\nUK\n\nThe UK legalized prescription based medical cannabis in November 2018. Medical\ncannabis treatments that are advertised with specific medical claims must obtain\nauthorization from the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Currently,\nlicensed medical cannabis products are Sativex, Dronabinol and Nabilone. Epidiolex,\nmedical grade pure CBD produced by British pharmaceutical company, GW\nPharmaceuticals, is undergoing the licensing process. “Unlicensed” products may be able\nto be obtained, such as products from Tilray or Bedrocan, under special circumstances\nwhich are unmet by other licensed products. Canopy and Aurora announced at the\nbeginning of 2019 that it plans to export to the UK later this year. Despite changes in\nlegality, the number of patients who have been prescribed medical cannabis treatments\nis quite limited.\n\nWhile pharmaceutical grade products are difficult to obtain, CBD products are widely\navailable across the UK. Pure CBD is not a controlled substance under the Misuse of\nDrugs Act 1971. Therefore, as long as CBD products are not authorized by the MHRA,\nmedical claims on labeling and packaging cannot be made. There are also no enforced\nregulations for testing or packaging. These loopholes in the legislation have led to an\nincreasing number of CBD products marketed as health supplements or wellness\nproducts. Due to the growing trend, CBD products have been widely available across the\nUK, primarily sold in boutique shops, cafes, health stores and online. Holland and\nBarrett, a health foods store, was the first High Street store to carry CBD products in\n2017. Other mainstream outlets now sell hemp-based beauty products, CBD tinctures,\nedibles, vapes, e-liquids and other forms of the substance. A handful of restaurants also\noffer CBD cocktails or hot drinks, and the number of kitchens and chefs using cannabis-\nbased products is increasing across the country.\n\nHowever, in January 2019, the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) announced that it\nplans to conduct an investigation of CBD products for consumer safety. It is expected\nthat the FSA will later provide requirements for authorization. This may take up to 18\nmonths. Although enforcement is unclear at the moment, some CBD products have\nalready been removed from the shelves. Since the FSA’s assessment does not apply to\ncosmetics or skincare products with CBD, some CBD companies have expressed interest\nin launching beauty products now.\n\nA license is required in order to cultivate hemp in the UK. There are restrictions on\nwhere the farm can be located that must be approved by the Home Office. Many\ncompanies still struggle to secure banking and payment options for their hemp-related\nbusinesses. A lobbying group, the British Hemp Association, was formed to educate and\npush for legislative changes, such as whole plant processing and financial support. Due\nto barriers of entry, the number of hemp farmlands is small, around 810 hectares.\n\nItaly\n\nMedical cannabis has been legal in Italy since 2013, yet access and supply remained\nrestricted for years. In 2017, the Military Chemical and Pharmaceutical Plant (MCPP)\nreceived a license to cultivate medical cannabis, which supplemented the imported\nsupply from the Netherlands (i.e. from Bedrocan). The MCPP cultivates a medical\ncannabis product, FM2, that contains 5-8% THC and 7.5-12% CBD. A high THC product\n(FM1) and a CBD product (FMO) will soon be available.

A few examples: Thomas Pynchon, Philip Roth, William Saroyan, Isaac Asimov, Theodore Sturgeon. Characters show up from Andy Warhol to Timothy Leary. And the photos of models weren’t even soft porn, merely tits and ass.\n\n\n     Cavalier was launched by Fawcett Publications in 1952. Men’s magazine Cavalier (motto: “For the American Male”) was published the year before Playboy, to whom it has often been compared. Back in the day, Cavalier tried to be seen as slightly hipper, more youthful, and considered a bit more clever than its big name rival. Almost an anti-establishment in Playboy. A slogan stated: “Your dad bought Playboy; you bought Cavalier.”\n\n\nI BECAME A COLUMNIST\n\n\n     I was invited to write a column, named “The Naked Emperor,” for Cavalier, that was beginning to publish underground writers and artists. They paid me $1,000 a month. My first column, in 1964, was a report on an auction of two-inch squares from the hotel bedsheets slept on by the Beatles during their first trip to America.\n\n\n     There were 300 screaming young girls, off on a fetishist’s holiday. Obviously, there wouldn’t be enough items to go around, but it was announced that the Beatles’ unwashed towels and bed linens were to be cut into two-inch squares and sold for $1 each. The price included a notarized statement of authenticity.\n\n\n     My second column was about Lenny Bruce—titled “Lenny the Lawyer,” since he defended himself in trials He was arrested for obscene performances only because there were no blasphemy laws, and he ridiculed religious leaders. I went to the bank and deposited my check, withdrawing half of it in cash, a $500 bill. Lenny was alone in his funky hotel room on Christmas Day when I presented it to him. And, with a large safety pin, Lenny attached the $500 bill to the outside breast pocket of his dungaree jacket.\n\n\nAFTER JFK ASSASSINATION\n\n\n       In another column of mine, “Jack Ruby and His Dirty Little Secret,” it began, “Lenny Bruce once told me how all the night club comics used to gossip about Jack Ruby’s “tattoo of a lady’s schmutzik (translate: pussy) in his armpit.” If it weren’t a fact, I was quite willing to settle for an apocryphal allusion which nevertheless crystallized the entire personality of that alleged murderer who wanted so very much to be liked.\n\n\n      I say alleged because upon Ruby’s own death. Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade said he would dismiss the murder charge against him, a promise which has since been kept, although no such posthumous grace was ever officially bestowed on Lee Harvey Oswald, considered a lone assassin who shot President Kennedy. See, they grant you retroactive innocence only in the face of innumerable witnesses who were present at the actual event through the legal miracle of inadvertent televised coverage.\n\n\n     Now Jack Ruby’s dirty little secret has been forever sealed away in his armpit by the hymen of history. Oh yeah, and at Lenny’s funeral, that safety pin was still attached on his denim jacket.\n\n\nJULES SIEGEL                      \n\n\n       Two years before Lenny’s death, with his permission I published his obituary in my own magazine, The Realist. Before the issue went to press, he called his mother and a few others to let them know it would only be a hoax. The point was that he couldn't get work and his work was his life so he might as well be dead. And if people regretted that they hadn't helped him, well, now they could have a second chance because he was still alive. The obituary evoked inquiries from newspapers, wire services, foreign publications, radio and TV.\n\n\n       “What's the meaning of it?” one editor asked me. “There's a lot of excitement at the city desk.”\n\n\n       “That is the meaning of it.”\n\n\n     A few years later, without my permission, Jules Siegel, the editor of a short-lived magazine, Cheetah, published a fake obituary of me. I thought it was funny. An Associated Press reporter called, and I explained that it was a hoax.\n\n\n     “Are you sure?” he asked.\n\n\n     “Of course. I would tell you if I was dead.”\n\n\n     Siegel started writing for Cavalier. His first assignment was a profile of Sterling Hayden, an actor best known in Dr, Stranglove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.\n\n\n     Journalist Adam Ellsworth described Siegel’s “Goodbye Surfing, Hello God” with his most famous example of rock journalism, though his most revolutionary was his article, “The Big Beat.” It appeared in the Playboy-esque Cavalier magazine in 1965 and was one of the earliest writings he’d ever seen on the development of rock and roll, from slaves singing in chains on their way to America to Bob Dylan “going electric” at the Newport Folk Festival. \n\n\n     Then Jules’ friend, Arthur Kretchmer, became Cavalier’s managing editor. “When the editorial director later resigned,” Kretchmer said, “there was a 24-hour hiatus before the new editorial director arrived.” Siegel and Kretchmer had been discussing the possibility of publishing an issue on rock and roll, so to make it happen, Kretchmer went into the office at night and retyped the magazine’s schedule to include their ideas.\n\n\n     When the new editorial director started, Kretchmer handed him the schedules and said, “Here’s what we’re working on.” The new editorial director suspected nothing and the rock and roll issue went ahead. Once the laughter died down, Jules talked for a good 25 minutes about some of the ups and downs of his writing career and how hard it is to make a living as any kind of a writer, let alone a “rock journalist.” and the people who created it, seriously.\n\n\n     Now everybody writes about rock and roll that way. Jules was one of the people who did it first. He died of a heart attack on November 17, 2012 at the age of 77. He was a brilliant author, but neither Rolling Stone nor the New York Times honored him with an obituary. Not even a fake one.\n\n\nCOMIX\n\n\n     Art Spiegelman tells me his work at Cavalier 50 years ago:\n\n\n      I was first invited into the mag to do two full-color comix pages in 1969 (when being printed in color was a Very Big Deal for me as was Getting Paid more than 25 bucks for a drawing), somehow in proximity to a big article on underground comix. It was around the time Vaughn Bode was made a regular contributor to the magazine, They were running some Crumb “Fritz the Cat” pages. All thanks to their hip, laid back and kind editor, Alan LeMond.\n\n\n     I also did some gag cartoons, short strips and occasional illustrations for Cavalier (one especially bad drawing for a story by Bruce Jay Friedman, I recall). My work as an apprentice underground cartoonist taking too many drugs was really, really awful. By the time I'd gotten incrementally better as a cartoonist in the first half of the 1970s I was regularly doing illustrations for soft-core fiction stories in Cavalier's low-rent sister mags, Dude, Gent and Nugget (even wrote a story or two there and got several of my San Francisco comix cronies -- Spain Rodriguez, Bill Griffith and Justin Greene) illustration gigs for those mags as well.\n\n\n         [Note in Wikipedia: Maus is a graphic novel by American cartoonist Art Spiegelman, serialized from 1980 to 1991. It depicts Spiegelman interviewing his father about his experiences as a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor. The work employs postmodernist techniques and represents Jews as mice, Germans as cats, and Poles as pigs. In 1992, Maus won a Pulitzer Prize.]\n\n\nCOMiING AND GOING          \n\n\n     I wrote some movie reviews for Cavalier. I recall that Midnight Cowboy was 50 years ago. I always went to two screenings. The first one I would go stoned with magic mushrooms. The second one I took notes. However, I got fired by Cavalier.\n\n\n     They declined to publish a particular column–-my review of MASH as though it were a Busby Berkeley musical called Gook Killers of 1970-– ostensibly on the grounds of bad taste, but I learned that three wholesalers had told the publisher they were pressured by the FBI and would refuse to distribute Cavalier if my name appeared in it.\n\n\n     On top of that, my name was on a list of sixty-five “radical” campus speakers, released by the House Internal Security Committee. The blacklist was published in the New York Times, and picked up by newspapers across the country. It might have been a coincidence, but my campus-speaking engagement-bookings stopped abruptly. It felt just like a film.\n\n\nOH, WELL\n\n\n       It was over for me, but it had been fun—like the issue with only the one large red headline on the Cavalier cover: “BEAT ‘EM SENSELESS FIRST”—THE FREE SPEECH CONTROVERSY, BY PAUL KRASSNER...\n\n\n     At the University of California in Berkeley on September 1964, Dean Katherine Towle banned posters, easels and tables at the Bancroft-Telegraph Street entrance to the Berkeley campus “because of interference with flow of traffic.” She also reminded student groups of “rules prohibiting the collection of funds and the University facilities for the planning and implementing of off-campus political and social action.”\n\n\n     As a result, students held a sit-in lasted till 3 a.m. Next day, ten tables were manned again, and a campus policeman approached one of the tables (manned by the Congress of Racial Equality) where a dozen persons were seated. One was singled out and placed under arrest. But before you could say nonviolent demonstration, the police car was surrounded, its captors reaching as many as 3,000 students. During the late evening, bored fraternity men gathered and tossed lighted cigarettes and eggs on those sitting in the plaza. The demonstrators responded with silence.\n\n\n       Next day, 450 police assembled on campus to remove the cop car and its arrested inhabitant, but an agreement to negotiate was reached and the demonstrators dispersed. One of the folk songs to come out of the Free Speech Movement was If I Negotiate With You to the tune of the Beatles’ If I Fell in Love With You.\n\n\n       Over the next couple of months there was a series of sit-ins and attempted negotiations, and then, on December 2, the infamous Sproul Hall sit-in. It took twelve hours for 800 students to be arrested by some 600 instructors of a new course called Introductory Police Brutality. These were from the lab notes student took:\n\n\n “We should do like they do in them foreign countries—beat ‘em senseless first, then throw them in the bus.”\n\n\n       There was a freshman co-ed at Berkeley who—long after she had forgotten what some professor spouted during an official lecture about Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment—would remember, with perhaps a twinge of frightened pride, learning from a fellow demonstrator that if she planned to go limp when the police arrested her, it would be an act of practical feminine foresight to remove the earrings from her pierced lobes in advance.\n\n\n     So, now in 2019, fighting over free speech has been happening heavily at Berkeley campus again. Meanwhile, Trump grabbed the pussy of the Statue of Liberty. Cavalier, anyone?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Beyond that, we don’t need a\nsingle inch of the West Bank, and we won’t ask for a single inch.”\n\nI replied in much the same vein when President Clinton urged me to help kick-\nstart new talks with Assad by formally reaffirming Yitzhak’s “pocket deposit” on\nthe Golan Heights. As with the Palestinians, I was not going to cede a major\nnegotiating card — our only real negotiating card — before we had any indication\nAssad was serious about making peace. But I did feel it was necessary to reassure\nClinton that / was serious. I told him that, if and when the Syrians showed real\nsigns of readiness to address our needs in a peace agreement, I would reaffirm the\n\n“pocket deposit.”\n\nI’d come to Washington hoping that President Clinton would be with me on the\nmain issues of substance. But what I needed most at this point was his support on\nthe procedural decisions I’d made in order to get to real peace negotiations:\nengaging with Syria first, and shifting the emphasis on the Palestinian track away\nfrom the redeployments toward the core permanent-status issues we’d have to\nresolve in order to get a peace agreement. What emerged from my first meetings\nwith President Clinton was essentially a trade-off. He knew I would be ready to\nmake concessions in pursuit of genuine peace. I was confident that on the route\nthat I was proposing to take, he would have my back.\n\nBut what I couldn’t be sure of was whether my own government would have\nmy back. On paper, we had a comfortable Knesset majority: 75 out of the 120\nseats. But I knew it was inherently vulnerable, both to friction between the\nOrthodox parties and assertively secular MKs from Meretz and inside Labor, and\nto possible defections over the concessions we might have to consider in peace\n\n327\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011798\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The critique is profoundly misplaced, supported neither by the law or the facts, \nnor by the structure of our constitutional republic. To the contrary, Jeffrey was subjected to an unprecedented \nfederal intrusion into a quintessentially local criminal matter in south Florida. His offense to the social order --\ninvolving sex for hire -- was entirely a matter entrusted to laws of the several States, not the federal \ngovernment. His conduct -- a classic state offense --was being treated exactly that way by able, honest \nprosecutors in Palm Beach County, but the overweening federal government intruded where it did not \nbelong. And now, over ten years after the fact, the current assault on federal decision-makers at the time, \nincluding now-Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta (then the United States Attorney in south Florida), condemns \nthe federal authorities for not going far enough. \nThe critics are entirely wrong. Neither the facts nor the law support the misguided criticisms being leveled by \njournalists and politicians at federal officials from over a decade ago -- including the highest levels of the \nJustice Department in Washington, D.C.. \nHere are the key facts: Jeffrey Epstein, a successful self-made businessman with no prior criminal history \nwhatever, engaged in illegal conduct that amounts to solicitation of prostitution. That was wrong, and it was \nreasonably viewed as a violation of Florida state law. Although no coercion, violence, alcohol, drugs and the \nlike were involved, the unsavory facts were carefully assessed by experienced state prosecutors who \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030315 \naggressively enforce state criminal laws. No one turned a blind eye to potential offenses to the public \norder. To the contrary, the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office conducted an extensive 15-month \ninvestigation, led by the chief of the Sex Crimes Division. Mr. Epstein was then indicted by a state grand jury \non a single felony count of solicitation of prostitution. \nDuring that intense investigation, the state prosecutors extensively gathered and analyzed the evidence, met \nface-to-face with many of the asserted victims, considered their credibility -- or lack thereof -- and considered \nthe extent of exculpatory evidence. Then, after months of elaborate negotiations, the state prosecutors believed \nthey had reached a reasoned resolution of the matter that vindicated the public interest -- a resolution entirely \nconsistent with that of cases involving other similarly-situated defendants. \nThen, in came the feds. The United States Attorney's Office tried, to no avail, to fit Mr. Epstein's situation into \nits vision of what it viewed as a commercial trafficking ring targeting minors. This was anything but. At long \nlast, the federal authorities acknowledged that stark reality and grudgingly agreed to defer prosecution to the \nstate. But there was a huge catch. In the face of our arguments sharply condemning their overreach, the \nfederal prosecutors insisted on many unorthodox requirements that tugged at fundamental values of due \nprocess. For example, the agreement required Mr. Epstein to pay an undisclosed list of asserted victims \n$150,000 each. Even more, the feds insisted that Jeffrey pay for an attorney to represent such unidentified \nvictims if any chose to filed civil litigation against him. When asked what possible legal authority supported \nthis extravagant exercise of national power, the feds lamely cited a wildly inapposite case from Alaska \ninvolving cocaine and forced on-the-street prostitution. Apples and oranges. \nUnder the federally-forced deal, Jeffrey was sentenced to jail. That would not have been the case under the \nagreed-upon state disposition of this non-violent, consensual commercial arrangement. Jeffrey complied, \nserved that sentence, and in the process was treated exactly the same as other state-incarcerated \nindividuals. His conduct was exemplary, and so characterized by the state custodial authorities. He continued \nhis work, including his many philanthropic efforts. \nOur friend Jeffrey Epstein has paid his debt to society. He has also paid out millions of dollars to the asserted \nvictims and their highly-creative lawyers. For over ten years, he has lived an exemplary life, including \ncarrying on his wide-ranging philanthropies. Those of us who represented him in the Florida proceedings -- for \ncustomary professional fees -- now count him as a trusted friend. \nOur nation faces vitally important challenges, many involving the treatment of women and basic human \ndignity. Voices are rightly being raised speaking truth to power, especially about women in the \nworkplace. But Jeffrey, an exemplary employer, has long since been called to account by the criminal justice \nsystem for his misdeeds of yesteryear. In the spirit of the bedrock American belief in second chances, that \nunhappy chapter in Jeffrey's otherwise-magnificent life should be allowed to close once and for all. \nOn Thu, Dec 13, 2018 at 4:24 PM J <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nken ,would take a stab at the article for the law journal. ? thx \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

If he had been asked to leave\nthe Department of Justice, it would dramatically hurt my chances if it were he\nmaking my case to senior officials. He swore up and down, as southerners are apt to\ndo, that there was no truth whatsoever to the allegations. Being charged with\nuntrue allegations rang close to my heart, and | chose to side with Lewis. Only after\nmy incarceration, when Lewis and Tein came to see me in a 9’x 10’ attorney room\nthat smelled of urine, and I told them that I was now being sued by many of the girls\non the government list, they expressed their regrets and their willingness to help.\nHowever, as they walked out down the dungeon like hall with the sound of clanging\ngates in the background, they were unaware of the security cameras and\nmicrophones throughout the hallway. They chose to high-five one another on\ncamera and smile with the comment, “This is going to be a couple more years of\nfees”. The guards at the jail, accustomed to some of the most heinous physical\ncrimes imaginable, and hardened against most of humanity’s foibles, were caught off\nguard by the exhilaration of the potential of more fees.\n\nSex for money; it’s a sensitive subject.

Yes, I paid for sex. 1am a john. Yes, ] understand that\nprostitution is a crime and a crime that very few johns have even gone to jail for. |\nam aware that there are strong feelings amongst many people regarding that crime.\nMany countries have legalized it, some states have legalized it; many have a policy of\nno enforcement. New York City has escort services that openly advertise, massage\nparlors that have neon signs in midtown. In actual fact, the crime of paying for sex at\nthe time of my transgressions was under penal code 230; equivalent to that of jay\nwalking unless the girl was under 15. Yes, under the age of 15. That was in New\nYork. In Florida, the age of consent is 18. Misrepresentation of age is not considered\na defense. Even if the girl worked in a sex establishment where one has to prove age\nto work, if the girl was met in a bar where the drinking age is 21, or shows ID that\nappears to be valid that she is over 18, that is not a defense. The State Attorneys\nwho deal with this sort of crime on a regular basis reviewed the case brought by the\nlocal police, and said in no uncertain terms that there “were no real victims “ in the\nEpstein case. NO real victims. Their words; they said the women knew what they\nwere doing. They even brought their best friends to Epstein’s house after going\nthere a number of times themselves.

Under these\nconventions, countries that are parties undertake commit-\nments to adopt a range of preventive and criminal law mea-\nsures to combat corruption. The conventions incorporate\nreview processes that allow the United States to monitor\nother countries to ensure that they are meeting their inter-\nnational obligations. Likewise, these processes in turn permit\nother parties to monitor the United States’ anti-corruption\nlaws and enforcement to ensure that such enforcement and\nlegal frameworks are consistent with the United States’ treaty\nobligations.” US. officials regularly address the subject of\n\ncorruption with our foreign counterparts to raise awareness\n\nof the importance of fighting corruption and urge stronger\n\nenforcement of anti-corruption laws and policies.\n\nOECD Working Group on Bribery and the Anti-\nBribery Convention\n\nThe OECD was founded in 1961 to stimulate eco-\nnomic progress and world trade. As noted, the Anti-Bribery\nConvention requires its parties to criminalize the bribery\nof foreign public officials in international business transac-\ntions.*! As of November 1, 2012, there were 39 parties to\nthe Anti-Bribery Convention: 34 OECD member coun-\ntries (including the United States) and five non-OECD\nmember countries (Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, the Russian\nFederation, and South Africa). All of these parties are\nalso members of the OECD Working Group on Bribery\n(Working Group).”\n\nThe Working Group is responsible for monitoring the\nimplementation of the Anti-Bribery Convention, the 2009\nRecommendation of the Council for Further Combating\nBribery of Foreign Public Officials in International\nBusiness Transactions, and related instruments. Its mem-\nbers meet quarterly to review and monitor implementation\nof the Anti-Bribery Convention by member states around\nthe world. Each party undergoes periodic peer review.”\nThis peer-review monitoring system is conducted in three\nphases. The Phase 1 review includes an in-depth assess-\nment of each country’s domestic laws implementing the\nConvention. The Phase 2 review examines the effectiveness\nof each country’s laws and anti-bribery efforts. The final\nphase is a permanent cycle of peer review (the first cycle of\nwhich is referred to as the Phase 3 review) that evaluates\na country’s enforcement actions and results, as well as the\ncountry’s efforts to address weaknesses identified during the\nPhase 2 review. All of the monitoring reports for the par-\nties to the Convention can be found on the OECD website\nand can be a useful resource about the foreign bribery laws\nof the OECD Working Group member countries.”\n\nThe United States was one of the first countries to\nundergo all three phases of review.

The analysis makes two assumptions. The first\nassumption is all the changes in the Balance of Payment’s (BoP) reserve assets are\nreflected in the headline FX reserves figure. The second assumption is that the income\nbalance is USD -36bn, which was derived from the annual rate since 2015.\n\nWe believe a decline of FX reserves to USD 2,600bn to USD 2,900bn would only be a\nproblem for China if it attempted to implement a “fixed exchange rate” without capital\ncontrols. Such an FX regime requires heavy FX intervention and would put downward\npressure on its FX reserves, making this FX regime choice no longer tenable for China.\n\nThe IMF’s framework for calculating adequate FX reserves is based on whether there\nare capital controls and whether the currency operates on a fixed or floating exchange\nrate regime (Table 6). The latest readings show a fixed exchange rate regime without\ncapital controls in China would require USD 2,91 1bn of FX reserves, which probably\nwon't be achieved, as shown in Table 1. Meanwhile, a floating exchange rate regime\nwith no capital controls would require USD 1,618bn of FX reserves. Fewer FX reserves\nwould be needed to manage a floating currency that would adjust freely to capital flows.\nThis reinforces the view that the CNY is moving toward a more flexible FX regime as its\nFX reserves are depleted (barring a draconian step capital control measures).\n\nSkeptics may counter that China could always ratchet up capital controls to reassert\ncontrol over its currency. However, the efficacy of this is questionable. The experience\nof 2016 shows that in spite of more capital controls introduced in late 2015 (e.g.,\nonshore window guidance restricting the sale of FX by onshore banks) capital outflows\nhave continued along with FX reserve depletion, albeit at a slower pace. Ultimately, this\nmeans China’s ability to exert control over the CNY is being eroded, while the risk of\nmore CNY volatility is rising. This is our scenario for 2017, with the tail risk that “ugly\nflows” or illicit capital flight due to domestic financial stability concerns could drive\nsharper CNY depreciation and FX reserve depletion.

Such a line had to be, to the best of\nthe United Nations’ knowledge, in conformity with Lebanon’s international boundar-\nies. On this basis, and with the consent of the parties, the UN Secretary-General could\nthen report to the Security Council and eventually recommend that it should confirm\nthat Israel had ended its occupation. This understanding led to an agreement for the\nUnited Nations to negotiate with the Governments of Lebanon, Syria and Israel.\nThrough intense, difficult, and stormy tripartite negotiations over five months, the\nUN Secretary-General was in May 2000 able to report to the Security Council that the\nUN had reached an agreement with Israel, Syria, and Lebanon on a line of withdrawal\n(the so-called Blue Line). On this basis, it was determined that Israeli troops had left all\nLebanese territory. Further, he reported that, consistent with UN requirements, Israel’s\nLebanese proxy, the South Lebanese Army (SLA), had been disarmed and disbanded.\nSubsequently, the UN Security Council confirmed the end of Israel’s occupation of\nSouthern Lebanon in fulfillment of Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426 of 1978.\n\nIn September 2004, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1559. Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan appointed me as his special envoy for its implementation. In a\nnutshell the resolution called for respect for Lebanon’s sovereignty, territorial integrity,\nand political independence; the disbanding and disarming of all Lebanese and non-\nLebanese militias; and the withdrawal of all foreign troops. After Israel’s full withdrawal\nfrom Lebanon in 2000, the only remaining foreign troops were Syrian. Immediately\nafter the resolution was adopted, I engaged in intense negotiations with President\nAssad, who until the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafic Hariri on 14\nFebruary 2005, was consistently resistant to move on the issue. On 12 March 2005, I\nwas airborne with a small UN team, among them Fabrice Aidan, on my way to\nDamascus for a new round of talks with the President. Midway, the captain informed\nme that he was requested to change course and land in Aleppo. Afterwards I was told\nthat the reason was to avoid the media who were waiting for the arrival of the UN team\nin Damascus. I was picked up at Aleppo airport by Walid Muallem, who was then\nDeputy Foreign Minister. He brought me to Assad’s villa, where a few hours of\nnegotiations resulted in the Aleppo understanding, which outlined Syria’s military\nwithdrawal from Lebanon with specific timelines. Assad honored his word, and\nended twenty-nine years of Syrian military presence in Lebanon consistent with\nResolution 1559.\n\nWhat is often forgotten in the recurrent doom and gloom in the Middle East, is that\nthe step-by-step approach, which started with the Camp David Accords of 1978, has\nfor more than thirty years led to conflict resolution: peace between Israel and Egypt; the\nOslo Accords; the mutual recognition of Israel and the PLO; the establishment of the\nPalestinian Authority in Gaza and the West Bank, which still functions with its\npresidency, cabinet, and ministries; peace between Israel and Jordan in 1994, with\nthe recognition of borders and a long-lasting security cooperation; Israel’s withdrawal\nfrom Southern Lebanon in 2000; and the subsequent Syrian military withdrawal five\nyears later; as well as Israel’s pull out from the Gaza Strip. All these steps would have\nbeen difficult, if not impossible, without the previous ones.\n\nIn 2000 the attempts to put a final end to the Syrian-Israeli and the Palestinian—\nIsraeli conflicts both failed.

The housing ministry is looking to issue Islamic bonds to help\nfund the country’s REDF at the end of 2017.\n\ne 4) Overrun development costs: Long delays for construction approval and permits\ntranslate to overrun costs which create obstacles for developers to launch\neconomically feasible projects.\n\nA persisting shortage of affordable residential supply\n\nThe shortage of housing is not a new phenomenon - it has been ongoing for decades.\nThe demand outlook from end-users is solid. Domestic household formation (marriages)\nis a large component: newly married Saudi couples need an affordable place to live. With\nmarket demand growing by 105K units pa (BofAMLe), we believe the shortage of supply\nwill persist for the following reasons:\n\ne The limited scalability of residential projects — Dar Al Arkan is the largest\nresidential developer with only a 1% potential market share (delivery capability of\n1,100 units pa).\n\ne The capital-intensive Saudi financing model — without funding support from the\ngovernment and a virtually non-existent off-plan sales market, Saudi developers\nhave to secure funding to undertake larger residential projects. Dar Al Arkan is\nhaving to lever up, as land sales, which were once the primary source of funding,\nare no longer enough to enable it to scale up.\n\n¢ A lack of incentives for large regional developers to enter the market — the\ndearth of off-plan sales has dried up the cash flows of developers and limited their\nability to finance new projects and, in the worst cases, ongoing projects.\nFurthermore, the profitability of affordable housing projects is not compelling\nenough to attract developers to the Kingdom.\n\nFragmented Saudi residential market\n\nSome 75% of new housing supply is from individuals and micro-home builders. This\ntrend highlights Saudis’ preference for building their own homes and illustrates the\nimmature profile of the real estate market in Saudi Arabia. Sovereign actions in\nneighbouring countries, like the UAE, have boosted the sector (land granted to\ndevelopers, capital flows from international investors). We see big developers becoming\nmore active in the Kingdom but the effects on supply will not be immediate, in our view.\nSo far, they represent only 15% of the total market.\n\nKey strategic objectives and KPIs to watch\n\ne The Ministry of Housing is looking to: 1) improve performance of the real estate\nsector and increase its contribution to the GDP; and, 2) enable citizens to obtain a\nsuitable residence.

She is also the grand-daughter of Edward\nShevardnadze, a former foreign minister and Politburo member of the Soviet Union and, after the\nSoviet Union broke up, the first president of Georgia. Even though she had interviewed many top\npolitical figures in Russia, obtaining an hour-long interview with Kucherena was a coup since, up\nuntil then, he had not discussed the subject in Snowden in a television interview.

Snowden told them that he had divided the stolen NSA documents into two separate sets\nof documents. One set he gave to Poitras and Greenwald on thumb drives. The other set, which\nhe told them that he considered too sensitive for these journalists, he retained for himself. As late\nas July 14, 2013, Greenwald told the Associated Press that Snowden held back documents and\n“Is in possession of literally thousands of documents ... that would allow somebody who\nread them to know exactly how the NSA does what it does, which would in turn allow them\nto evade that surveillance or replicate it.\" One issue for U.S. investigators at the NSA, CIA\nand Department of Defense was what Snowden did with the second set afer his meetings with\nthe journalists in Hong Kong.

But massive parallelism is not in itself a solution — one also needs the right\narchitecture; which DeSTIN provides, building on prior work in the area of deep learning.\n\nHumanlike intelligence is heavily adapted to the physical environments in which humans\nevolved; and one key aspect of sensory data coming from our physical environments is its\nhierarchical structure. However, most machine learning and pattern recognition systems are\n“shallow” in structure, not explicitly incorporating the hierarchical structure of the world in\ntheir architecture. In the context of perceptual data processing, the practical result of this is\nthe need to couple each shallow learner with a pre-processing stage, wherein high-dimensional\nsensory signals are reduced to a lower-dimension feature space that can be understood by the\nshallow learner. The hierarchical structure of the world is thus crudely captured in the hierarchy\nof “preprocessor plus shallow learner.” In this sort of approach, much of the intelligence of the\nsystem shifts to the feature extraction process, which is often imperfect and always application-\ndomain specific.\n\nDeep machine learning has emerged as a more promising framework for dealing with complex,\nhigh-dimensional real-world data. Deep learning systems possess a hierarchical structure that\nintrinsically biases them to recognize the hierarchical patterns present in real-world data. Thus,\nthey hierarchically form a feature space that is driven by regularities in the observations, rather\nthan by hand-crafted techniques. They also offer robustness to many of the distortions and\ntransformations that characterize real-world signals, such as noise, displacement, scaling, etc.\n\nDeep belief networks [HOTO06] and Convolutional Neural Networks [LBDE90] have been\ndemonstrated to successfully address pattern inference in high dimensional data (e.g. images).\nThey owe their success to their underlying paradigm of partitioning large data structures into\nsmaller, more manageable units, and discovering the dependencies that may or may not exist\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012983\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Parts\nof the observer’s motor system become\nactivated, making it possible to respond\nin synchrony. In fact, the specific actions\nthat are observed are not as important as\nthe perceived goals or intentions of the\nobserved person. One consequence of\nthis is that a person is sensitive to new\nactions in the social environment. A\nsecond is that significant actions by\nanother person can quickly produce\ncomplementary motor responses. Thus,\nadaptive social behavior is a product of\nperceptual monitoring and motor\nprocesses. The complexity of the social\nenvironment necessitates selective\nresponding to socially significant\nfeatures of any social interaction. Such\nselective responding depends on the\nobserver having particular goals for\naction. The identification of significant\nstimuli (e.g., a threatening backhand\nsmash) activates in the competitor’s\nbrain goal-driven decision processes that\noperate in parallel with continuous social\nmonitoring and lead to a counteraction\n(e.g., a defensive lob) produced by the\nmotor system. However, a linesman\ncollecting a ball during a tennis match\ndoes not constitute a significant action\nfor the competition and, even if\nobserved, does not initiate any\ncounteraction.\n\nLet us now return to the\nperspective of a spectator at the tennis\nmatch. While the specific movements\ndriving the tennis match have significant\nimplications for the players’ actions,\nthese movements have a different\nimplication for the spectator from whom\nno overt responses are warranted. If an\nobserved action produced by someone\n\nPage |6l\n\nelse does not have personal significance\nfor an observer, the motor system does\nnot respond in the same way at all’. The\ngoal-dependent aspect of observing the\nactions of others allows us to understand\nand respond quickly and effectively\nwithout confusing what we do with what\nwe see. However, in some special cases,\nwhen a group of individuals all respond\ntogether, the same motor system may\noperate differently. It is in these\nsituations when we are neither observer\nnor respondent but part of a flock or\nchorus that our sense of individuated self\nmay begin to dissolve into the larger\nsocial group.\n\nThe Social Parameters for Suspended\nSelf-Consciousness\n\nThe dissolution of self-other\nboundaries is likely to be manifest under\na specific set of conditions, which\nincludes a strong feeling of identification\nwith (i.e., connection between) oneself\nand a group of others, the absence of\nconstraints to action by oneself or the\nobserved others, a common goal shared\nby the group, and the absence of a\nrecognized external synchronizing signal\nto which one can attribute any\nsynchronized behavior. Clapping in\nunison following a rousing performance\nis amore common example. This\nremarkable phenomenon is evidenced\ndespite considerable individual\ndifferences in clapping tempos. The\ntransition to entrained clapping, whereby\neach clapper affects the surrounding\nother clappers both locally and globally,\nenhances the noise intensity at the\nmoment of the clapping even though it\nleads to a decrease in the overall average\nnoise intensity in the room.\nSynchronized behavior occurs\nrhythmically and one way of capturing\nits regularities is to model its cycles,\nperiods, frequencies, and amplitudes '”.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021307\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It took the form ofa\ncompact, simply designed computer program he’d written and designed to spread\nquickly and easily on the young systems of the Internet. It ran a mere 99 lines, took\nmost computers nanoseconds to execute and it worked like this: The program - it\nlater became known as a “worm” by the police who would come to find and arrest\nMorris Jr. - would find an open door on a network-connected computer. (In 1988,\nthe pre-Warez Dude era, finding such doors was not difficult. Finding locked doors\nwas probably harder.) Once Morris’ program had slithered inside and loaded itself\nonto the machine, like a dog slipping through an unattended puppy door, it would\nsniff around, rattle a few more doors to find any passwords that had been left\nunsecured. Then it would move on to the next machine. Knock, knock. Rattle, rattle.\nNext machine. Morris designed his code to simply repeat this process over and over.\nFilling, as a result, each machine’s memory with multiple, peformance-deadening\ncopies of the same program. A house full of puppies, in a sense. After several hours\nof this flu-like spread, a wave of unplanned, unending computation began choking\nthe net.\n\nMorris later explained he’d only meant his program as a demonstration, as a test of\nsorts. He wanted to show how machines might be made more safe. But he seemed to\ngrasp, almost immediately, that he’d made a mistake and that the worm was\nrunning away from him. He emailed a friend: How the hell to stop it? His friend had\nno idea either. They scrambled at least to warn system administrators about the\ndangerous code that would shortly devour their machines. “There may be a virus\nloose on the Internet,” they wrote. But that note, in a bit of bad luck, was\nquarantined inside a Harvard computer that had already been unplugged. So, a few\nhours after Morris released his code, unwarned and unprepared, the Internet froze.\n212 On November 2\"¢ and 3rd, 1988 machines around the world were shut off, cables\nwere pulled out of walls, and systems were wiped and restarted in a race to stop the\nrobot-like spread of the disease and then to finally kill it off. 213\n\nThe Morris Worm was, on those fall 1988 days, acting out a sober-minded insight of\nthe famed biological historian Alfred Crosby: “The nineteenth century was followed\nby the twentieth century, which was followed by the...nineteenth century.”214\nCrosby meant that our age of topological connection meant we were back, again, in\nan age of infections. And this was true: Morris program was mapping out, like an\nepidemic, new routes in the age of high-speed digital contagion. But - and this is\nwhy we care about it here - by the time it reached “peak infection”, the worm was\n\n212 So, a few hours: David Moore, Colleen Shannon, k claffy, “Code-Red: a case study\nof the spread of a worm on the Internet” IMW ‘02 Proceedings of the 2nd ACM\nSIGCOMM Workshop on Internet measurment (2002), 273-284\n\n213 Morris later explained: Ted Eisenberg, DavidGries, Juris Hartmanis, Don\nHolcomb, and M.

This unpredictability is partially responsible for changes in the brain. Promiscuous mating\nsystems demand more flexibility, creativity and out of the box thinking.\n\nThe anthropologist Steve Gaulin explored the idea that a species’ mating system is directly\nrelated to its capacity to think. Gaulin started by looking at two closely related species of voles, one\nmonogamous and the other polygynous. In the polygynous vole, males typically mate with multiple\nfemales. To achieve this kind of mating success, males have large territories that encompass many\nsmaller female territories. In the monogamous species, the male and female share the same territory, with\nmating restricted to the couple. These differences in mating system and space usage have two direct\nconsequences: relative to the monogamous male vole, the polygynous male vole must travel much further\nin a day than the females and must recall where the female territories are located. For a polygynous male\nvole, mating success depends on long day trips, visiting each of the female territories. For the\nmonogamous male vole, there are no physical or memory challenges as the female is virtually always\nnearby. Given the costs to a polygynous male vole of forgetting where the females live, there should be\nstrong selection on the memory system. Gaulin confirmed this prediction by showing that polygynous\nmale voles outcompete females of their species in a maze running competition, and also have larger\nmemory systems than females. In the monogamous vole, there are no sex differences in maze running or\nmemory.\n\nGaulin’s work provides a gorgeous example of how evolutionary pressures can act on the brain to\ncreate differences in psychological capacity. Other examples abound, including evidence that fruit eaters\nhave larger brains than leaf eaters, primates living in large social groups have larger frontal lobes than\nthose living in smaller groups, and bats living in open habitats have smaller brains than those living in\ncomplex closed habitats. In each case, a particular ecological or social pressure — finding ripe fruit,\nupdating the status of numerous social relationships, avoiding obstacles while in flight — sculpts\ndifferences in brain anatomy and function. Some of these pressures favor extreme specialization and\nmyopia, whereas others favor a broader vision. Relative to every healthy member of our species, all other\nanimals have tunnel vision. When our ancestors began to migrate out of Africa, the diversity of\nenvironments and social opportunities favored generalists with a broad and flexible vision.\n\nTo appreciate the significance of the human revolution in brain engineering, consider three cases\nof myopic, but highly adaptive intelligence in other animals, cases that lack the signature of intellectual\npromiscuity; these cases are of particular interest because they represent the kinds of examples that\ncaused Darwin to doubt the beneficence of God, to reflect upon the cruelty of nature, and to ponder the\nproblem of evil:\n\n* The wasp Ampulex compressa tackles a specific species of cockroach, inserts a\n\nfirst stinger into its body to cause leg paralysis and eliminate fighting, then a second\n\nHauser Chapter 1.

That sentiment was further underscored when Ballmer’s letter contained no reference or thanks to Gates, with\nwhom he has been tightly tethered over the last several decades. Its absence has been much discussed internally at\nMicrosoft, where ithas been seen as an unusual slight and a sign of a rift.\n\nGates also did not reference his longtime business partner in any celebratory manner in Microsoft's announcement. “Asa\nmember of the succession planning committee, I'll work closely with the other members of the board to identify a great new\nCEO,” said Gates, in the entirety of the quote about Ballmer’s retirement. “We’re fortunate to have Steve in his role until the\nnew CEO assumes these duties.”\n\nOther sources cautioned that it was not indicative of tensions between the pair, but was done to minimize “lame duck\nconcerns’ that might arise if Ballmer was portrayed as already out the door.\n\nThose sources also insist that Gates never asked Ballmer to step down sooner, although they acknowledge that he also did\nnot — as Gates had in the past — disagree that it was best that he move on.\n\n“Did Gates instigate it? No,” said one source with knowledge of the situation. “But was he as supportive of Ballmer as he had\nbeen in the past? Maybe not.”\n\nThat was still a big change, of course. Gates — who has always been and remains the key decision-maker on Microsoft's\nboard — had always been Ballmer’s major backer, despite increasing pressure both externally and from other directors for\nhim to step down.\n\nGates had rejected such suggestions for years. That included former director and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, who many\nsources said had been one of the first to urge that the company replace Ballmer as CEO, as well as from a spate of Wall\nStreet investors complaining about the company’s declining value in the Ballmer years.\n\nAs AllThingsD’s John Paczkowski wrote on Friday: “Here’s one metric by which Ballmer will be judged harshly. On the last\nday of 1999, the day before he took over as CEO, Microsoft’s market capitalization was $600 billion. On the day before he\nannounced his intention to retire, it was less than $270 billion.”\n\nThat’s a damning number, of course, coupled with a widespread sentiment that Ballmer had missed critical trends in tech\nunder his tenure. Despite a strong growth in revenue, investors and others had long concluded that Microsoft had thrived\nwhen Gates was CEO and waned under Ballmer’s rule.\n\nStill, until recently, there has been no signal from the company indicating any change in top leadership. In fact, the\nmanagement reorganization backed strongly by the board a month ago had essentially placed Ballmer at the center of the\nstructure under a plan described as “One Microsoft.”\n\nAnd, at the time of the restructuring announcement in July, Ballmer’s definite and clear message was that he was there to\nstay:\n\n“Lots of change. Butin all of this, many key things remains the same. Our incredible people, our spirit, our commitment, our\nbelief in the transformative power of technology — our Microsoft technology — to make the world a better place for billions\nof people and millions of businesses around the world. It’s why | come to work inspired every day. It’s why we’ve evolved\nbefore, and why we're evolving now. Because we’re not done. Let’s go.”\n\nThough early in its rollout, the changes have been jarring and created a level of chaos at the company that has led to much\ngrumbling internally. It also did not help that the restructuring was quickly followed by a dismal Q4 performance by Microsoft.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019420\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

A shared interest in peace - neither side\nwants a collision, both understand the costs - is shimmied apart by a perception\ngap. Cultural, historical, temperamental and ideological differences accelerate the\nunzipping of even the best intentions. Misunderstanding bends and then snaps\nirrevocably into mistrust. So yes, the recovered islands and the trade tensions and\nthe political theories have to be managed because each is a blister that limits\nforward motion - but the real source of friction? It is the scraping of different world\nviews. This is deep strategic misalignment. It is, in fact, the stuff of war.\n\nIn recent years, America has had two different, nearly opposite approaches to China,\neach however marked by an assured national confidence that the current world\norder is sustainable. One policy is short-handed as “engagement” - or, colloquially,\n“panda hugging.” As China becomes more prosperous, this approach suggests, she\nwill become more congenial to American interests. More cuddly. This was, for some,\nthe basis for bringing China into the World Trade Organization in the 1990s. Later it\njustified deep commercial links and educational ties. The logic of such an approach\nfit the mindset of many baby-boomer Americans: China’s attraction to MTV,\nMcDonalds and Mercedes hinted at a still deeper desire they thought. To be\nWestern. China’s citizens would surely become more attracted and committed to the\nworld system that had delivered all this prosperity. The country would become\nmore global, in a sense, and /ess Chinese.\n\nIn fact, as China has grown in recent years she has become more global and more\nChinese. Growth, wealth, an admixture of confidence into the old national habit of\ninsecurity - all of these have encouraged a searching exploration. The demands of\ndomestic politics, the instincts of the Chinese Communist Party and the inevitable\npractical questions of security and reform all produce sensible questions. China\nneeds oil, for instance. Must she project power into the Middle East? Control the sea\nlanes of the Malacca Straits? There’s no natural, inherent resistance to American\ninterests in any one problem, but that hopeful American logic of “engagement”\nignores much about China’s essence. The country presses at rules she mistrusts (as\nAmerica once did). She struggles with the inevitable challenges of a political system\nstill smoking a bit from recent revolutions - and, of course, facing the pressures of a\nnetworked age. But she holds, strongly, a sense of Chineseness. Can we honestly\nexpect to use mere prosperity to change China in a predictable, pro-American way?\n“Engagement” feels to Chinese like a demand to become more American. That\nprospect is as appealing as a request to become more Chinese would be for\nAmericans.\n\nAn alterative strategy to “engagment” is known as “containment”. (While not\nformally called “Panda Kicking”, this is often what this policy looks like.) This view\ntakes it for granted that as China becomes more powerful she will become a threat.\nAny growth in Chinese power means a decline in America’s influence and security. A\nstronger China in Asia, for instance, means a weaker America. Countries like Japan\nor Korea or the Philippines will be required to choose a side at some point, at some\nawful 21st Century Melian moment.

In general, the adequacy of measures\ntaken to prevent misuse of charitable donations will depend\non a risk-based analysis and the specific facts at hand. In\nOpinion Procedure Release No. 10-02, DOJ described the\ndue diligence and controls that can minimize the likelihood\nof an FCPA violation. In that matter, a Eurasian-based sub-\nsidiary of a U.S. non-governmental organization was asked\nby an agency of a foreign government to make a grant to\na local microfinance institution (MFI) as a prerequisite to\nthe subsidiary’s transformation to bank status. The subsid-\niary proposed contributing $1.42 million to a local MFI to\nsatisfy the request. The subsidiary undertook an extensive,\nthree-stage due diligence process to select the proposed\ngrantee and imposed significant controls on the proposed\ngrant, including ongoing monitoring and auditing, ear-\nmarking funds for capacity building, prohibiting compen-\nsation of board members, and implementing anti-corrup-\ntion compliance provisions. DOJ explained that it would\nnot take any enforcement action because the company’s due\ndiligence and the controls it planned to put in place sufficed\nto prevent an FCPA violation.\n\nOther opinion releases also address charitable-type\ngrants or donations. Under the facts presented in those\nreleases, DOJ approved the proposed grant or donation,'™\nbased on due diligence measures and controls such as:\n\ne certifications by the recipient regarding compliance\nwith the FCPA;!\n\ne due diligence to confirm that none of the recipient’s\nofficers were affiliated with the foreign government\nat issue;1\n\n* arequirement that the recipient provide audited\nfinancial statements;!°\n\n* awritten agreement with the recipient restricting\n\nthe use of funds;'”\n\n® steps to ensure that the funds were transferred to a\n\nvalid bank account;!”\n\n19\n\ne confirmation that the charity's commitments were\n\n109 and\n\nmet before funds were disbursed;\n* on-going monitoring of the efficacy of the\nprogram.!!°\nLegitimate charitable giving does not violate the\nFCPA. Compliance with the FCPA merely requires that\ncharitable giving not be used as a vehicle to conceal pay-\n\nments made to corruptly influence foreign officials.\n\nFive Questions to Consider When Making\nCharitable Payments in a Foreign Country:\n\n1. What is the purpose of the payment?\n\n2. Is the payment consistent with the company’s\ninternal guidelines on charitable giving?\n\n3. Is the payment at the request of a foreign official?\n\n4. Is a foreign official associated with the charity\nand, if so, can the foreign official make decisions\nregarding your business in that country?\n\n5. Is the payment conditioned upon receiving\nbusiness or other benefits?\n\nWho Is a Foreign Official?\n\nThe FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions apply to corrupt\npayments made to (1) “any foreign official’; (2) “any foreign\npolitical party or official thereof”; (3) “any candidate for\nforeign political office”; or (4) any person, while knowing\nthat all ora portion of the payment will be offered, given, or\npromised to an individual falling within one of these three\ncategories.'' Although the statute distinguishes between a\n“foreign official, “foreign political party or official thereof?\nand “candidate for foreign political office” the term “for-\neign official” in this guide generally refers to an individual\nfalling within any of these three categories.\n\nThe FCPA defines “foreign official” to include:\n\nany officer or employee of a foreign government or\n\nany department, agency, or instrumentality thereof,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022521\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Testing, labeling and certification requirements vary\nwidely across jurisdictions, but increasingly are being required by state law and demanded by supply-\nchain intermediaries and consumers. Uniform standards for testing and reporting are expected to\nemerge as scientific understanding of cannabis increases and as industry consensus about cannabis-\nrelated health and safety concerns develops.\n\nProviders of extraction, manufacturing and testing services generally must obtain state and local\ncannabis licenses and are exposed to risks related to federal legal violations.\n\nComposition and Potency\n\nLaboratories ordinarily test cannabis for the specific amounts of 10 to 15 cannabinoids and more than\n30 terpenes. Cultivators and production intermediaries rely on these test results to identify and track\ncannabis varieties and to monitor the quality and consistency of production methods. Retailers and\nconsumers use test results information to assist in purchasing decisions. Almost all consumer products\nnow include labeling that, at a minimum, indicates the amounts of THC and CBD.\n\nPesticides\n\nControlling and disclosing the presence of pesticides in cannabis products is increasingly becoming\na focus of regulators and producers. Even cannabis grown under organic conditions can be exposed\nto pesticides inadvertently, so many states now require all cannabis products to be tested by a state-\nlicensed laboratory for pesticides. Pesticides can be especially problematic in cannabis concentrates;\nstudies have shown extraction processes may concentrate pesticides at a rate higher than cannabinoids\nand terpenes.\n\nMicrobiological Organisms\n\nCertain molds, other fungi and bacteria found in and on the cannabis plant can damage the plant\nor certain cannabis products and can be harmful if consumed by humans. Mold is a problem most\ncommonly found in indoor growing environments and during the cannabis drying and curing process.\nOrganisms found in cannabis and identified by testing includes aspergillus, salmonella, pseudomonas\nand E.coli.\n\nResidual Solvents\n\nMost extraction processes use solvents to extract the active compounds from cannabis plant material.\nCommonly used solvents include butane, carbon dioxide, ethanol or propane. Residual solvents are\nthose trace amounts of solvents that remain in a cannabis concentrate after the extraction process.\nSome residual solvents can be harmful if consumed by humans in sufficient amounts, and others\nshould not be consumed in any amount.\n\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC S7\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024673\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Will QE3 become necessary?\n\ne How will the election outcome change fiscal policy deliberations?\n\n© Can politicians find an agreement to avoid sharp fiscal contraction in early 2013 (\"fiscal cliff\")?\n\nCIO View (Probability: 65%*) No QE3, political gridlock and some fiscal tightening\n¢ The economy stays on a moderate growth path, coupled with stable core PCE inflation close to the Fed’s\ntarget of 2%. UBS forecasts real GDP growth of 1.5% in 2Q 2012 (consensus: 2.1%) and 2.3% in 3Q 2012\n(consensus: 2.4%), with some downside risk due to rising uncertainty. The Fed has decided to extend so\ncalled \"Operation Twist\" until the end of the year. More near-term monetary easing is still possible, but it\nis currently not our central scenario.\n\n¢ In the elections, Republicans will likely lose seats in the House overall, but retain a majority; we also\nexpect them to win a narrow majority in the Senate. Obama will likely retain the White House. Such an\nelectoral outcome would confirm the existing gridlock between Republicans and Democrats.\n\ne Against the backdrop of ongoing political gridlock, we expect only moderate fiscal tightening of about\n0.9% of GDP in 2013. The government will likely let unemployment benefits and the payroll tax cut expire,\nbut postpone income tax hikes and sequestration spending.\n\nA Positive scenario (Probability: 10%*) No QE3, Democratic sweep and more fiscal tightening\n\n¢ Propelled by ultra-expansive monetary policy and improved confidence, cyclical forces surmount the\nstructural hindrances and thus growth accelerates. More rapid growth leads to higher inflation, and the\nFed responds by tightening monetary policy sooner.\n\n¢ The improved economic outlook raises the odds for an Obama re-election and makes it harder for\nRepublicans to win a majority in the Senate. US fiscal consolidation efforts are facilitated by faster rising\ntax collections. A Democratic stronghold leads to some tax hikes and limited spending cuts. Fiscal policy\ntightens by about 1.2% of GDP in 2013.\nNegative scenario (Probability: 25%*)\n¢ Structural hindrances dominate and weigh on the cyclical recovery, thus growth weakens or turns\nnegative. The Fed embarks on QE3, most likely in the form of agency MBS and Treasury purchases.\n\ne Weaker economic conditions raise the odds for a larger Republican majority in Congress, but Obama\nremains President. The debt limit is reached earlier and the Treasury runs out of money before year-end.\nThe political gridlock becomes dysfunctional, thus fiscal policy tightens by USD 600 billion (3.7% of UBS\nestimate of 2013 GDP) in 2013 (“fiscal cliff”).

Finally, before an Arizona court accepts a plea, the prosecutor must advise the court\n\nthat reasonable efforts were made to confer with the victim about the plea and the victim's view regarding it. !74\n\nThe rule proposed here is narrower than these state formulations: it requires only that a prosecutor confer with the victim about\nthe plea and inform the court if the victim objects. For many significant categories of federal cases (e.g., typical drug\ntrafficking offenses, felons in possession of a firearm, etc.), there will be no victim, much less a victim objection. In such cases,\nto require some sort of victim inquiry by the court or victim certification by the prosecutor would unnecessarily waste time.\nThe proposed rule requires only that the prosecutor report a victim's objection - in which case the court will presumably want to\nmore carefully consider whether to accept a plea.\n\nRule 12.1 - Victim Addresses and Phone Numbers Not Disclosed for Alibi Purposes\nThe Proposal:\n\nThe Government currently must disclose the address and telephone numbers of any witnesses, including the victim, that it\nplans to use to disprove an alibi. This rule should be changed to protect the victim's privacy, excluding their information from\nthis requirement.\n\n(b) Disclosing Government Witnesses.\n\n(1) Disclosure.

Both an attorney for the government and the defendant must promptly disclose in writing to\nthe other party the name of each additional witness, and the address and telephone number of each additional witness (other\nthan a victim) if:\n\n(1) the disclosing party learns of the witness before or during trial; and\n(2) the witness should have been disclosed under Rule 12.1(a) or (b) if the disclosing party had known of the witness earlier.\n\nIn addition, a similar change should be made to Rule 12.3 regarding the addresses and telephone numbers of victims who will\nbe used to disprove a public-authority defense.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nThis proposed change implements the victim's right to be \"reasonably protected from the accused.\" !7> The victim cannot be\nreasonably protected if the defendant, without good reason, is given the victim's address and telephone number. The proposed\nrule strikes the current requirement that the prosecutor must automatically give the defendant the victim's address and telephone\n\n'73 See id.\n\n4 Ariz. Rev. Stat.

These aims are the root of real\nsecurity in any age. “In anarchy, security is the highest end,” Kenneth Waltz wrote.\n“Only if survival is assured can states seek other goals such as tranquility, profit and\npower.”247 Survival - and Waltz’s other essential aims - will be decided by the\nnature of our future connection. In this sense, Hard Gatekeeping produces a decisive\nchange in our posture. It lets us aim for something instead of merely being against\nmovement or - hopelessly - against the future. It establishes priorities, clarifies our\nreal core interests, helps us budget our effort and our expenses — better, perhaps, to\nspend atrillon dollars building tools of topological mastery like infrastructure or\nnew technology than chasing Middle East peace.**® Gatekeeping does not transcend\nthe long-standing debates between the cold realism of Stalin and the idealism of\nWoodrow Wilson so much as it sets us a preliminary task: Shaping the environment.\nTo build and control the next generation of gatekept systems should be our aim\nnow. In the future paper currency wil be replaced by secure digital bit transactions.\nGenetic information will demand smart, live-connected platforms for efficient\nmining and study.

Mastering\nthem will be as important as having military bases, trade missions or treaty\narrangements once was. The development of such systems plays to our strengths;\nthey deliver both security and useful pressures of innovation. Remember - the aim\nisn’t to build walls. It is to use the logic of networks and gates, and all the complex\nproductive force they release.\n\nBs\nThe elements of Hard Gatekeeping can be stated simply enough:\n\nFirst, Does it work for us? We seek a landscape of technology, trade, finance,\nknowledge - all the tools of power - that balances the pressures of politics with a\ncolder grasp of longer-term national interest. The protocols, alliances, treaties and\ndata webs that enable markets, trade or thinking machines - all are gatelands we\ncan cultivate, improve and protect. Our gatelands must be designed to limit the\nrippling risks of contagion or error moving wildly, like spring weather, inside linked\ncomplex systems now. Control of topologies is what air superiority or sea mastery\nonce were. The opening attacks of future wars will come invisibly and silently\nthrough networks, in space, in fast topological strikes — not with noisy land\ninvasions or bombing runs.

DOJ and SEC\nencourage companies like Company A to conduct extensive FCPA due diligence. By uncovering the corruption, Company\nA put itself in a favorable position, and, because the corrupt payments have stopped, Company A has no continuing\nliability. Whether DOJ and SEC might charge Company B depends on facts and circumstances beyond the scope of this\nhypothetical. DOJ would consider its Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business Organizations and SEC would consider\nthe factors contained in the Seaboard Report, both of which are discussed in Chapter 5. In general, the more egregious\nand long-standing the corruption, the more likely it is that DOJ and SEC would prosecute Company B. In certain limited\ncircumstances, DOJ and SEC have in the past declined to bring charges against acquired companies, recognizing that\n\nacquiring companies may bear much of the reputational damage and costs associated with such charges.\n\nScenario 2:\n\nCompany A plans to acquire Company B. Although, as in Scenario 1, Company A conducts extensive due diligence, it\ndoes not uncover the bribery until after the acquisition. Company A then makes certain that the illegal payments stop and\nvoluntarily discloses the misconduct to DOJ and SEC. It quickly integrates Company B into Company A's own robust internal\ncontrols, including its anti-corruption and compliance policies, which it communicates to its new employees through required\nonline and in-person training in the local language. Company A also requires Company B's third-party distributors and other\nagents to sign anti-corruption certifications, complete training, and sign new contracts that incorporate FCPA and anti-\n\ncorruption representations and warranties and audit rights.\n\nBased on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute?\n\nAbsent unusual circumstances not contemplated by this hypothetical, DOJ and SEC are unlikely to prosecute\nCompany A for the pre-acquisition misconduct of Company B, provided that Company B still exists in a form that would\nallow it to be prosecuted separately (e.g., Company B is a subsidiary of Company A). DOJ and SEC understand that no\ndue diligence is perfect and that society benefits when companies with strong compliance programs acquire and improve\ncompanies with weak ones. At the same time, however, neither the liability for corruption—nor the harms caused by it—\nare eliminated when one company acquires another.

In both cases, the bribery was extensive and known by high-level\n\nmanagement within the companies.\n\nBased on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute?\n\nYes. DOJ and SEC have prosecuted companies like Company C on the basis of successor liability. Company C is a\ncombination of two companies that both violated the FCPA, and their merger does not eliminate their liability. In addition,\nsince Company C is an ongoing concern, DOJ and SEC may impose a monitorship to ensure that the bribery has ceased\n\nand a compliance program is developed to prevent future misconduct.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022535\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

As the technology\nindustry became more important to the global economy and was better understood by the investment\ncommunity, however, investment banks and other industry analysts tracked an increasing number of\ndiscrete yet related industry segments. In the cannabis industry we are seeing a similar trend, which we\nexpect to continue as the industry evolves.\n\nTo help investors better evaluate investment opportunities in the cannabis industry, we currently\ndefine five primary segments: production, distribution, consumer products, business solutions and\ndigital media. We further divide each segment into multiple subsegments. Each segment has unique\nopportunities and risks. For example, companies that possess, manufacture or distribute cannabis\n(commonly known as “touching the plant”) face risks related to violating federal law—and state-law\ncompliance obligations—not generally faced by providers of business software or digital media con-\ntent. Many businesses operate in multiple segments, and we expect industry leaders to emerge in each\nsegment. The five primary segments and their subsegments are illustrated in the following chart.\n\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC 31\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024667\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

What gives us\nconfidence in this putative earnings recovery is the more synchronized nature of the\ncurrent recovery. All major regions of the world are showing momentum in growth\nindicators for the first time in several years. One measure of the broad nature of the\nimprovement is manufacturing PMI surveys. Of 29 Markit PMIs 83% are currently above\n50, highest since August 2014. More importantly, 79% have improved over the last 3\nmonths — higher than at any point in the last three years.\n\nBull case of global GDP towards 4% would signal double digit EPS growth. To see a\nmore bullish outcome for EPS we would need to see global GDP accelerating further. Based\non our regression model, double digit EPS growth historically was consistent with global GDP\ngrowth above 3.8%. Under our bull case scenario for 2017, with say 4.0% global GDP growth,\nconsensus EPS growth forecasts for +14% in Europe would become realistic.\n\nPMs beyond 55 would suggest upside to base case. Significant further gains in\nleading indicators would be a signal that earnings growth could exceed our base case.\nOver the longer term EPS growth has followed manufacturing PMI surveys with a 9-\nmonth lag approximately (using an average of US and Eurozone). Historically readings\nabove 55 were consistent with mid-teens EPS growth. The relationship has weakened in\nrecent years as low interest rates and weaker commodity prices weighed on earnings in\nFinancials and Resources. Nevertheless, in the last year of decent EPS growth in Europe\nin 2014 the PMIs peaked at 54 so we would look for upside to our base case EPS\nforecast should PMIs improve to the mid-50s level or beyond.\n\nBankof America <> :\nMerrill Lynch European Equity Strategy |01 December 2016 =—-11\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014470\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We look forward to hearing from\nyou soon.\n\nTHC\n\nTIIC Group backed by Edmond de Rothschild, is a pan-European infrastructure firm advising on mid-market\ninfrastructure projects across Europe in both the transportation and social sectors. It was established in\n2008 by the 3 founding partners of TIIC Group, Jaime d’Almeida, Manuel Cary and Francisco Mendes, with\nstrategic support from the Edmond de Rothschild Group and Brisa.\n\nThe aim of TIIC Group is to bring an operational approach to infrastructure investments in Europe, drawing\nupon the extensive management and financial skills of its team members. These skills have been developed\nover many years at some of Europe’s leading infrastructure operators and project financing firms which,\nwhen combined with the very specific infrastructure expertise of both the Edmond de Rothschild Group and\nBrisa, makes for a powerful and differentiated investment platform.\n\nTIIC Group operates from two offices in Lisbon and Paris, providing its team with access to relevant\ninvestment opportunities across key target markets in Europe as well as to leading industrial contractors,\noperators, advisors and financiers in the infrastructure industry.\n\nTIIC Group successfully raised a First Fund with €140m of commitments targeting transportation\ninvestments across Europe. The portfolio of the First Fund comprises 6 assets located in Portugal, Spain,\nFrance and Poland. They represent a carefully balanced mix of greenfield and early stage brownfield projects\nin roads and car parks. TIIC Group has played an active role in the sourcing and development of all\ninvestments and has made a significant contribution to value creation. TIIC Group believes that this is a high\nquality, operationally secure, cash yielding portfolio of assets which will be of strong interest to potential\ninvestors over the coming few years.\n\nTIIC has launched a successor fund, TIIC 2, which will build upon TIIC Group’ differentiated approach to\ninfrastructure in Europe. TIIC 2 will is targeting aggregate commitments from investors of €300m (€350m\nhard cap) to invest into both transportation and social infrastructure projects in Europe. TIIC 2 will also seek\nto invest, ona very selective basis, into greenfield social infrastructure projects in New Frontier Markets,\nwithin close proximity to the European Union. Given its powerful network of relationships across Europe and\nthe operational skills of its team, TIIC Group will continue to target superior investment returns for TIIC 2’s\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026070\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

When these new\nand improved mice ran through an IQ test, they outperformed normal mice.\n\nTsien pulled off an extraordinary engineering trick, creating a lineage of smarter mice. This is\ncowboy science, showing the power of genetic tampering to open the door to evolutionary changes. In a\nworld of competition, one would imagine that selection should favor these smart mice who have better\nrecall of essential foraging routes, previous social interactions, and places to rest out of harm’s way from\npredators. But in biology, there are always trade-offs. Benefits in one area of life are often accompanied\nby costs in others.\n\nSeveral months after Tsien’s report, a follow-up study of the same memory-enhanced mice\nappeared in print, also in a distinguished scientific journal. But this time there was no media fanfare. The\nnew work was carried out by Min Zhuo at Washington University, an ex-member of Tsien’s lab and a co-\nauthor of the original paper. Zhuo’s new paper confirmed that memory-enhanced mice were indeed\nsmarter, but also showed that they were more sensitive to pain, licking their wounds more and for longer\nperiods of time than normal mice. Though it is unclear whether Zhuo’s results reveal heightened pain\nsensitivity, stronger memories for pain, or some combination of these and other processes, what is clear is\nthat the engineering that led to smarter mice led to much more.\n\nTsien and Zhuo’s work shows that even with targeted, artificial changes in the underlying\nbiology, unanticipated consequences are common. It also shows that deep within the biology of every\norganism lies hidden capacities and potential for change. Unleashing these sub rosa capacities can have\nboth beneficial and costly consequences for the individual and group.\n\nThe idea I develop in this chapter is that our capacity for evil evolved as an incidental, but natural\nconsequence of our uniquely engineered brain. Unlike any other species, our brain promiscuously\ncombines and recombines thoughts and emotions to create a virtually limitless range of solutions to an\never-changing environment. This new form of intelligence enabled us to solve many problems, but two\nare of particular interest given their adaptive consequences: killing competitors and punishing cheaters in\na diversity of contexts. But like the painful fall-out from artificially engineering a smarter mouse, so too\nwas there fall-out from the natura/ engineering of a smarter human: a species that experiences pleasure\nfrom harming others. This is part of the recipe for evil.\n\nThis chapter sets out the evidence to support the idea that evil evolved as an incidental\nconsequence of our brain’s design. I begin by discussing the two general processes that landed us in the\nunforeseen and uninhabited niche of evildoers: the evolution of byproducts and promiscuous connections\nwithin the human brain. Because these are general processes, we will take a short reprieve from matters\n\nspecifically evil.\n\nHauser Chapter 1.

The fact sheet\npoints to two proposals: one that requires money, and one that doesn't.

Education officials said\nFriday that they plan to solicit ideas from colleges on what government rules are hindering innovation. Many educators\nmight say that red tape gets in the way of experiments in distance learning and degree programs not organized around the\ntraditional credit hour.\n\nThe fact sheet asserts: “The Department will use its authority to issue regulatory waivers for ‘experimental sites’ that\npromote high-quality, low-cost innovations in higher education, such as making it possible for students to get financial aid\nbased on how much they learn, rather than the amount of time they spend in class.”\n\nBack to top\n\nMassively Online And Offline Too: How MOOCs Will Evolve In The Physical World\nGiovanni Rodriguez — Forbes\n\n| was at the airport about this time last Sunday, when | overheard a conversation that’s becoming quite commonplace. One\nperson was explaining to another what a MOOC was, but he couldn’t remember what the letters stood for. As someone who\nregards himself as an amateur, ad-hoc, in-the-moment teacher, | felt compelled to help him out: “Massive. Open. Online.\nCourse.” He thanked me. He had been struggling to remember the “open” part of the MOOC message. And, even more\ninteresting, he had been struggling to remember the word “course.”\n\nOver the past few months, more and more clients and partners have been coming to me to deconstruct not just the acronym\nbut also the attributes of MOOCs. So often in fact that | have decided to write a short series on the subject. There are many\nthings to say about both the true impact and hype about MOOCs in the larger narrative that’s emerging about disruption in\neducation. But from where I sit, what’s most important to note about MOOCs in 2013 is something that the acronym does\nnot yet capture: the massive disruption we’re seeing in education will be online and offline, too.\n\nExperience\n\nThere are at least three reasons for this. And each of these reasons deserves at least one post, but I'll be super brief here.\nThe first is that the online experience of MOOCs will almost certainly evolve in a way that teachers, students, and staff will\nlook to find ways to meet with one another. This will either happen by design (by intent and with care) or it will happen\norganically. Almost certainly, the producers of MOOCs will look to do this with some sense of design, while leveraging the\norganic power of networks to grow by themselves. And if you have been following the evolution of MOOCs, you already\nknow that the online experience is still a work in progress. My business colleague, Chris Bennett — a behavior designer and\ngamification expert — and | recently spoke about this: many are stuck in the old paradigm of delivering education to the\nconsumer, rather than leveraging the greatest assets of the new medium (co-creation, crowdsourcing, collaboration). By\nredesigning the online experience to become more interactive, innovators in the MOOC world will see the possibilities for\noffline experience.\n\nInventory\n\nAnother reason for thinking about physical space: while the world ponders the impact that the costs of higher education will\nhave on schools that are struggling to compete, the inventory of quality physical space that becomes available will appeal to\norganizations that need it. A couple of years ago, | had the privilege of serving as an advisor to a White House initiative that\ntraveled the country meeting with leaders in large spaces in a network of state and community colleges. As a former\ntheater producer, | was impressed with the availability and quality of these spaces. In theater — and other kinds of shared,\nquasi-spiritual, transformative experience — physical space is everything. Innovators in the MOOC world will get wise — if\nthey haven't already — to the existence of networks of spaces (there are many different networks, as | will show in a later\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019434\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

A student with the long-held\nintent of becoming a researcher and with\nno interest in politics, government, or\npublic service might seem to be an\nimmovable object. And yet, in that\nmoment, Jordan’s speech had sufficient\nimpact to make government service\nseem like the only path one would want\nto take or should ever consider.\n\nAlthough her points were argued\nwell, the impact of Jordan’s speech was\nnot simply rhetorical. John F.\nKennedy’s “Ask not what your country\ncan do for you....” and Martin Luther\nKing, Jr.’s “I have a dream....” affected\nlisteners deeply well beyond the\ncognitive strengths of a good argument.\nMoreover, while all these speeches were\ndelivered beautifully and from the heart,\nit is not the performance of these\nspeeches alone that can move listeners to\nact on behalf of others. The\nperformance alone cannot give substance\nto an empty message. While there are\ncases in which a great performance may\nsuggest briefly that there was content of\nimport even in the absence of a real\nmessage, it is more likely the\nconjunction of message and delivery that\nmoves people. In these speeches is a\nclear demonstration of the power of\nlanguage. Language is more than words\nand more than delivery. Indeed, Cicero,\nin De Oratore, said that rhetoric conveys\ninformation, persuades listeners, and\nevokes emotion.\n\n“In the beginning was the word....”\n\nIf “the word made flesh” is taken\nmetaphorically, the power of language\ncan be made visceral in sermons.\nConsider the power of Jonathan\nEdwards’ sermon, which Clark Gilpin’s\nchapter discusses, to terrify a\n\nPage | 67\n\ncongregation, to wrench them from\ncomplacency with images of torment. A\nsermon delivers a message, but it can do\nso in calm tones of instruction or with\nfire and brimstone. The choice and\npoetry of words and the cadence and\nintonation of speaking can draw the\nlistener in slowly or seize the listener\nsuddenly, the very sounds of speech\npainting images in the mind while\nigniting new inferences with literal and\nmetaphoric descriptions.\n\nIn the realm of the spiritual, there\nare few corporeal manifestations that can\nbe perceived directly. Neither heaven\nnor hell, neither God nor the Devil can\nbe seen or heard or touched. Preaching\nis needed to spell out the work of unseen\nhands and will and illuminate the power\nof the unseen. The force of that which is\nnot seen can only be felt when\ntransmitted directly through speech.\n\nIn Phaedrus, Plato described\nrhetoric as the art of leading the soul.\nThus it is not surprising that, while at the\ncore of religion is a collection of beliefs\nand concepts and canons, the fabric and\nform of religion is language. Symbols\nand icons are certainly important, but\nlanguage is the medium through which\nthe force of theology is actualized in\nprayers, benedictions, sermons, and\nteaching. Language can reach across\ntime and space to change minds,\nfeelings, and behavior, encoding laws\nand beliefs and presenting them with a\nconcrete reality in the here and now.\nThis is one kind of impact from author to\naudience in which a kind of connection\nis constructed bridging minds.\n\nAt the same time, in religious\npractices, another kind of connection is\nformed within a congregation. Joint\nrecitation, responsive reading, collective\nlistening, and understanding may serve\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021313\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

However, we think the tide may be turning as last week, the Fed,\nECB, and BOE all delivered policy announcements with hawkish tones. How far they\nreally go to tighten policy when economic data is weakening still remains unknown.\nHowever, we think the uncertainty surrounding tightening will be more positive for EM\nvolatility than for DM volatility.\n\nChinese banks: Rapid increase in leverage is a big concern\n\nThe HSCEI currently has a 70% weight in the financial sector. Recently, BofAML analyst\nWinnie Wu turned very bearish on the sector as (1) leverage has rapidly increased—debt\nto GDP rose by 18% in 2016 and may go above 300% by 2019, (2) shadow banking has\nbecome too big, too complicated, and too levered to easily regulate—even at the\nhighest quality bank, China Merchants, off-balance sheet wealth management products\n(WMP) have grown to 40% the size of on-balance sheet assets from just 18% two years\nago, and (3) excessive home price inflation—low and middle-income households are late\nto the party and a correction in prices could have a systemic effect as property assets\nhave been used as collateral in WMPs.\n\nSPX: The Fed is now “collaring” the market\n\nSince the global financial crisis the Fed has been well known for providing a put option\nby its willingness to step in during periods of market stress. However, post the Fed\nmeeting last week, it appears the central bank has decided to cap its monetary support\nas some FOMC members seem worried that financial conditions are too loose.\nEffectively, the market is now “collared” (more so for the SPX compared to EM) as the\ndownside is protected by the Fed put (though with a lower strike price) while the upside\nis capped by log-jammed fiscal policy and positioning, where the risk of quant funds\nselling record equity positions meets cashed-up investors still accustomed to buying-\nthe-dip.\n\nThe depressed implied China vs. US risks should reverse\n\nWith the steep drop in global risk premium, the HSCEI-SPX 18-month variance swap\nspread has fallen back to the lower-end of its 5-year trading range. Since we believe the\nglobal synchronized monetary tightening will impact HSCE! volatility more than SPX\nvolatility, we recommend owning HSCEI-SPX 70/110% corridor variance at 5 vol points,\na 3 vol point discount to vanilla variance spreads. Investors will be exposed to the\nrealized vol spread between HSCEI and SPX as long as HSCEI stays within 70-110% of\nits initial level. Pricing of corridor variance is cheaper than vanilla variance as investors\ncan avoid paying for the rich HSCEI convexity below the 70% barrier. The trade has a\npositive carry and benefits during China risk-off events.\n\nNote that the potential HSCEI index enhancement will reduce the financial weightings in\nHSCEI from 70% to 50% and lower realized volatility by 1.8 vol points. However, the\nenhancement will be implemented in stages. It will probably start in Dec-17 at the\nearliest and will not be fully implemented by the end of 2018, in our view.\n\nIndicative pricing (As of 19-Jun-17)\nBuy HSCEI-SPX Dec-18 70/110% corridor variance swap: 5 vol points\n\ndeg oes Bankof America\n16 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 20 June 2017 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014987\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Second, the\n\nResources sectors in 2017 will likely provide a (strongly) positive contribution to market\nEPS, in turn reversing what has been the biggest headwind for several years. Over the\nlast 3-5 years the Resources sectors provided a 2.5 percentage point drag on annualized\nmarket EPS growth. In 2016 Banks have been the other big drag on market earnings.\nWhile structural headwinds to profitability mean the contribution of Banks remains open\nto debate, consensus forecasts nevertheless imply a strong recovery in 2017 (driven in\npart by one-offs reversing). The important point is that the market ex-Banks and\n\nResources has delivered modest but positive EPS growth — estimated at +5.5% for\n2016. Hence, removing the drag from Oil and Mining makes high single digit growth\n\nachievable in our view.\n\nChart 29: Resources a 2.5pp drag on market EPS growth in recent years\n\nAnnualized EPS growth\n\nChart 30: Capex discipline supportive to margin outlook\nEurope Ex-Financials: EBIT margins vs capex/depreciation\n\n4 14% 100%\nm3yr mSyr m10yr 5\ncoe + 120%\n10%\n140%\n8%\n1609\n6% 60%\n4% 180%\n1990 1994 1998 2002 2006 2010 2014 2018\nEBIT / sales (LS, %)\nStoxx 600 Market Ex-Resources Market Ex-Banks & — — Forecast EBIT / sales (LS, %)\nResources Capex/depreciation - 2yma pushed 2y fwd (RS, %)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Factset\nMargin upside, capex discipline and FX tailwind provide additional support.

In addition, several years of relative capex discipline provide\npotential support for margin improvement over the next 1-2 years in corporate Europe.\nOver the longer term, we find that operating margins have tended to improve with a lag\nof one to two years, following a period of declining capex ratios.

Each\nis areal-world defense against topological pressures of population and ideology and\nviolence, all shaped by network magnetism. The likely futility of such gates is clear\nenough when you contemplate the forces they are intended to keep out: Refugees\nsee prosperity miles on their phones. Little wonder they rush at it. Internet-\ntransmitted messages light up ideologies, protests or fundamentalisms that pull\npeople back and forth endlessly across physical borders. The world responds, as\nanyone without a Seventh Sense might, with walls. But to focus merely on the\nphysical? This is to misread the issue. Gatekeeping includes real-world borders, of\ncourse, but the statesmen of the future will act particularly on topologies. They will\nwork not merely to stop up flows, but to decide their movement. Gates will, for\ninstance, serve as bespoke disease buffers, created to track and then freeze the\nwotrisome pandemics now crawling at us on the connections of our age. Other gates\nwill be economic tools: The will help isolate and then soothe the unstable and\napparently broken, middle-class eroding financial patterns of the past decades.\n\nRecall how the design of computer or network systems affects the real world, like a\nmarble slipped under a carpet? Gatekeeping’s topological design is like placing\nmarbles (or boulders) in particular ways, to direct movements and flows as you\nmight guide water with a canal. The great historian Arnold Toynbee once recalled a\npassing moment with British Prime Minister Lloyd George during the endless (and\ndisastrous) Paris Peace Conference of 1919. “Lloyd George, to my delight, had\nforgotten my presence,” Toynbee wrote, “and began to think aloud.\n‘Mesopotamia...yes...oil...irrigation...we must have Mesopotamia; Palestine...yes...\nthe Holy Land... Zionism... we must have Palestine...; Syria... h’m... what is there in\nSyria? Let the French have that.”246 This sort of charmless arrogance -— The Holy\nLand....We must have that - doesn’t much suit our age, but that comprehensive view?\nWhat oil and irrigation and Suez were to Lloyd George, emergence and data flows\nand gates are to us. There’s a crucial difference, however: We need not take the most\nprecious territory of our age through invasion or colonial exploitation or in mis-\nbalanced peace settlements. We can build the essential landscape of power. We can\nbuild it for defense. And then we can grow it, perfect it, and attract others. Schmitt\nwas right, human history is the story of enclosures - and nothing about our\nemerging age suggests any other approach can, with a single clear line, solve the\nvexing network x network x weapons problems we face. Hard Gatekeeping means\nmolding the landscape, gate by gate, to encourage certain movements and make\nothers difficult, costly, maybe even impossible. Any future order must begin with\nthis first principle: The line between in and out is as essential as what goes on\ninside.\n\n246 Lloyd George: Margaret MacMillan, Paris 1919: Six Months that Changed the\nWorld, (New York: Random House, 2002) p. 381\n\n172\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018404\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

'’7 Depositions authorized by Rule 15 are for the purpose of preserving evidence for trial,\nthus are effectively an extension of the trial. Victims accordingly have the right to attend such proceedings, if public, under the\nsame conditions governing their attendance at trial. To avoid any confusion over this issue, the proposed rule change directly\n\nstates that conclusion.\n\nBecause victims can be excluded from the trial in certain rare situations where their testimony would be materially affected,\n'79 they can likewise be excluded from a deposition in those situations. The proposed rule simply applies the limitations on\nattending trial to the deposition setting by providing that the \"same conditions\" apply to the victim's attendance at the\n\ndeposition.\n\n[*875]\n\nRule 17 - Victims’ Right to Notice of Subpoena of Confidential Information\nThe Proposal:\n\nRule 17 regarding subpoenas should be modified to give victims notice before personal or confidential mformation is\nsubpoenaed and to allow victims to file a motion to quash such a subpoena as follows:\n\n(h)(2) Victim Information.

If the court makes such a finding, notice shall then be given to the victim, through the attorney for the\ngovernment or for the victim, before the subpoena is served. On motion made promptly by the victim, the court may quash or\nmodify the subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nThe existing rules governing subpoenas are flawed because they allow the parties to subpoena personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim from third parties without the victim's knowledge.

However, we have yet to see meaningful pick-up in activity. We think that policy\nmeasures to support the economy should have more visible effect on activity in the second half of the\nyear.\n\n¢ To this effect, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) has recently cut interest rates by 25bps — the first such\nmove since late 2008. With investment demand still sluggish, we don't expect the measure to have a\nsignificant near-term effect on growth. Still, the cut confirms the leadership's commitment to support the\neconomy. Importantly, with the rate cut, measures were announced to increase the banks’ ability to set\ninterest rates, which should bolster private household spending power in the future.\n\ne The rate reduction took place against a backdrop of falling price inflation. Thus, inflation is no obstacle\nfor further measures to ease monetary policy. However, at this point we don't expect further rate cuts this\nyear; especially since increased interest rate flexibility should contribute to an easing of monetary\nconditions ahead. If anything, we think the PBoC may implement more reductions in banks' reserve\nrequirement rates to ensure sufficient liquidity provisions. Thus, we think the real focus has to be on the\nfiscal policy measures now, including possibly an acceleration of infrastructure investments, measures to\nsupport consumer spending and selective relaxation in the property market (while keeping home-purchase\nrestrictions intact).\n\nA Positive scenario (Probability: 20%*) Higher-than-expected growth\n\n¢ Chinese GDP grows above 8.5% in 2012. For this we would probably need to see stronger-than-expected\nfiscal and monetary policy support from the government. A speedy improvement in the Eurozone debt\ncrisis could also lead to this positive scenario.\n\n& Negative scenario (Probability: 10%*) Hard landing\n¢ Chinese GDP growth below 6%, i.e. a hard landing of the economy. This could be triggered by a global\nfinancial crisis/recession, causing a slump in Chinese exports. Other risks include a sharp decline in Chinese\nresidential property prices — which would slow investment growth, a large-scale default of local\ngovernment debt, or a surge in inflation that forces the PBoC to significantly tighten monetary policy.\n\nKey dates\n1 Jul Manufacturing purchasing managers index (Jun)\n13 Jul Fixed asset investment, industrial production lun), 2Q12 GDP\n\n11-15 Jul New bank lending, M2 Gun)\n22-25 Jul HSBC flash manufacturing purchasing managers index (Jul)\n\na UBS For further information please contact CIO analyst Gary Tsang, gary.tsang@ubs.com, Glenda Yu, glenda.yu@ubs.com, Patrick Ho, patrick-ww.ho@ubs.com\n\nFirst interest rate cut since 2008\n\n8\n\nun-03\nun-04\nun-05\nun-06\nun-O7\nun-08\nun-09\nun-10\n\nun-11\nun-12\n\n=== |-year lending rate ——= 1-year deposit rate\n\nSource: Bloomberg, UBS CIO, as of 18 Jun 2012\n\nPick-up in infrastructure investment\n\narmima\n\noe,\nHo,\n1\n3\n\nA ie\nli\n\nYear-on-ye ar\n\ni HM\n\n¥\n\nSource: Bloomberg, UBS CIO, as of 18 Jun 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\n* Scenario probabilities are based on qualitative assessment.\n\n10\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024145\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

They had lived this. Enabled it. Profited from it. If there was ever a\ngroup you might hope to take aside, pull into a quiet room and ask gently What are\nthe really networks for, anyway? this would be it.\n\nThe act of keeping time, of marking it, is embedded in the nature of any age. Our\nlives are, after all, dictated by timetables: School schedules, the seasons, rush hour,\nthe burning candle of birth-love-marriage-death. Time, in the days before industry,\nwas measured by nature’s schedule. How long it took a crop to mature. The\nsolstices. A beehive filling with honey. It was marked by moving tides and shifting\nseasons, and it demanded a slowness, a personal presence on the shores, in the\noceans, atop the fields over generations. “Summer afternoon,” the novelist Henry\nJames remarked in a précis of a slower age he felt passing away in 1895. “To me\nthose have always been the two most beautiful words in the English language.” 18°\n\nThen, in the industrial revolution, time became money. Electric lights, for instance,\nundid the restful distinction between night and day - and made 24-hour life and\nmanufacturing and economics possible and then, of course, inevitable. Movement\nfrom countryside to city established a really new sense of what the German critic\nGeorg Simmel, writing in 1903, called tempo. “With each crossing of the street, with\nthe tempo and multiplicity of economic, occupational and social life, the city sets up\na deep contrast with small town and rural life,” he explained. “The technique of\nmetropolitan life is unimaginable without the most punctual integration of all\nactivities and mutual relations into a stable and impersonal time schedule.”18! Punch\ncards. Bus schedules. The forty hour work week. Our education, our manufacturing,\nour markets and our lives all began to run on timetables. They had to, or the whole\nproject of industry would collapse. “Summer Afternoon” became a time to work.\nSimmel worried, for instance, over the diffusion of pocket watches. To carry one was\nlike looking at a constantly draining bank account.\n\nThis sense of humans reduced to cogs - churned, run, disposed of on a schedule not\ntheir own - unnerved the residents of that first mechanical age. Cities had been the\nvery first sorts of tight-packed networks; industrial cities ratcheted this further still.\nThey succeeded and failed by the degree to which they geared themselves and their\ncitizens to machine speed. When the Austrian novelist Robert Musil began The Man\nWithout Qualities, his classic story of the era, with the flattening of a Viennese citizen\nby a speeding delivery truck, he meant to point out how urban speed and urban life\n(and urban death) had become inseparable. And also the mismatch between the\nweak breaks of the age and it’s acceleration. The book is alive with that pre-accident\nslipping sensation you may have had: You are pressing hard on the brakes of the car;\nyou are going to hit something anyhow. “Cities can be recognized by their pace just\nas people can by their walk,” Musil wrote in a line that any modern New Yorker or\n\n180 “Summer afternoon”: Edith Wharton, A Backwards Glance, (New York: D.\nAppleton-Century, 1934) See chapter 10 for her tale of an afternoon with James.\n181 “With each crossing”: Georg Simmel, “The Metropolis and Mental Life” (1903)\nin Gary Bridge and Sophie Watson, eds.

He has served as the\nChair of the Psychology Department since 1997.\nHe has served as the editor for the International\nJournal of Speech Technology and 1s on the\neditorial board of Brain & Language, and has\nedited several books on spoken language\nprocessing. His research interests include\nspoken language use, mechanisms of learning\nand attention, and the role of sleep in learning.\nHis recent research has investigated the social\nuse of language and the evolution of language.\nIn addition, he has been working on neural\nmechanisms of reward and economic decisions.\n\nWe often think about language in terms\nof the information in newspapers or speeches or\nreports. However, language 1s basis of all our\nsocial relationships and institutions. We reward\nand praise with language and we shun and\npunish with language, perhaps more often than\nwith any other medium. In the recent election,\nDemocratic candidates actually gave speeches\noutlining different views of the importance of\nlanguage in our society. One candidate held that\nwords are simply words and only have the force\nthat we give to them by reasoning about them.\nThe other candidate argued that speech has the\npower to move people to connect and act.\nNusbaum was struck by this debate because it\nseems to him that the power of language goes\nwell beyond what linguists and psychologists\ntalk about as “meaning” and that understanding\nthe meaning of language may depend on\nunderstanding the social and emotional impact of\nlanguage. In this chapter, the idea of the impact\nof language at a distance is explored.\n\nPage | 66\n\nLanguage is one of the most\nimportant ways in which the social brain\nmakes connections, enhances\nconnections, and severs connections\namong people. Language is our primary\nmedium of social exchange, grounding\nand elaborating our selves and our\nrelationships in every conversation.\nHowever, language goes well beyond\npersonal connections to connect us\nculturally through stories, songs, and\nshared manners of speech. Language\nalso provides the formal framework that\ndefines many of our social institutions.\nLanguage gives form and substance to\nthe governance and behavior of every\nsocial institution from education to law\nto religion. Clearly there are many ways\nin which language serves to knit us\ntogether both formally and informally.\nFor a linguist, all of these uses can be\nanalyzed in terms of the structure of\nsentences and their content. However,\nstructure and content do not, on their\nown merits, provide a complete picture\nof how language can have the impact it\ndoes on our sense of social connection.\nHow does language move us to act,\nchange our feelings, and connect us to\nothers? It seems unlikely that the impact\nof language is simply the result of\ndispassionate rational inferences and\nconclusions drawn from a logical\nanalysis of sentences.\n\nIn 1976, Barbara Jordan, a\nCongresswoman from Texas, gave the\ncommencement address at Brandeis\nUniversity. Listening to her speak about\nthe importance of public service and the\nimportance of using talent and ability in\nservice of one’s country was an\nimpressive experience. Her delivery was\nclear and not particularly dramatic and\nyet the force of her speech was riveting.\nIt was sufficient to turn a graduating\nsenior’s mind from graduate school in\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021312\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This was largely a process of documenting the patterns\nof variation and uniformity that nature left behind. Only breeders were directly involved in manipulating\nthese patterns, using artificial selection to alter the size, shape, coloration, and lifespan of plants and\nanimals.\n\nThe Darwins of today continue this tradition, but with new tools, informed by understanding of\nthe genetic code and aided by technical developments in engineering, physics, chemistry, and computer\nscience. These tools allow for deeper penetration into the sources of change, and the causes of\nevolutionary similarities and differences. They also enable biologists to change the course of evolution\nand the patterns of development by turning genes off or turning novel ones on, and even creating\nsynthetic organisms in test tubes — a wonderful playground for understanding both questions of origin,\nchange, and extinction.\n\nThe Darwins of today are cowboys, trailblazing a new frontier of understanding. But like the\nfrontier of the early American wild west, nature holds many secrets and surprises. Sometimes when we\nbreak through nature’s guard, we gain fundamental truths about the living world, knowledge that can be\nharnessed to improve animal and human welfare. But sometimes when we break through, we create toxic\nconsequences and ethical dilemmas. Tampering with nature is risky business as there are many hidden\nand unforeseen consequences.\n\nIn 1999, the molecular biologist Joe Tsien and his team at Princeton University tampered with\nmother nature. Their discovery, published in a distinguished scientific journal, soon filled the\nnewspapers, radio airwaves, and even a spot on Dave Letterman’s late night television show.

In\naddition, the tech giant took a $900 million charge related to having to cut the price of its Surface RT tablet, which had — as\nyou might imagine — an impact on results. Missed profit expectations, missed revenue, missed all over the ying-yang.”\n\nWith the prospect that the next quarter could be weaker still and with numerous reports of late that there has been slowing of\nadoption from its new flagship Windows 8 offering, Ballmer and the board finally aligned to move his departure date sooner.\n\nMost critical to that decision, source said, were increased board worries that recent pressure from activist investor ValueAct\n— which has a large stake in the company — had a good chance of succeeding in its efforts to obtain a seat on the board of\nMicrosoft, especially if Ballmer stayed in place.\n\nAnd even if the software giant was able to thwart that from happening, said several sources, such a public fight is untenable\nfor the company, since it was likely to attract even more scrutiny to Ballmer’s performance and perhaps even more investor\naction.\n\nValueAct has until August 30 to notify Microsoft if it plans a proxy battle, and sources said it still wants more that Ballmer’s\nretirement. In talks, said sources, it has asked for an aggressive stock buyback and also a dividend increase, which might\nassuage its efforts to garner a board seat.\n\nBallmer denied any pressure from ValueAct specifically in his decision in an interview with the Seattle Times, though\nsources said that was simply bluster.\n\nAnd, even with mounting pressure on him, Ballmer definitely portrayed the change as his decision in an interview he gave to\nZDNet’s Mary Jo Foley last week, after his retirement announcement.\n\n“| would say for me, yeah, I’ve thought about it for a long time, but the timing became more clear to me over the course of the\nlast few months,” he insisted.\n\nWhen asked if Gates asked him to stay or go, he said no, apparently to both. “Bill respects my decision. | mean, it’s one of\nthese things when if it’s — you know, ultimately these kinds of things have to be one’s own personal decision.”\n\nThat statement also struck many inside the company as a quick shift. Ballmer, said sources, had been jumping\nenthusiastically into business review meetings, as part of the new structure, over the last month. In addition, he had\nexpressed to many employees his excitement at being part of the changes he had initiated.\n\nBut, in meetings after the announcement, numerous sources inside the company said Ballmer seemed uncharacteristically\nchastened and quiet, in contrast to his usual confident and forceful manner.\n\n“He was definitely not leaving and then he suddenly was,” said one source. “Even if today’s Steve made the choice, itwas a\nchoice yesterday’s Steve did not want to.”\n\nAnother source, close to the board, perhaps explained it best: “If ValueAct got on the board, | think Ballmer finally realized\nthat meant it was going to be the hard way from then on out until he left and he did not want that for a company he clearly\nloves and has been his life.”\n\nNow, those inside the company are turning to what comes next. While not everyone on the board thought that Ballmer\nshould step down without a new CEO in place, it’s moot now as Microsoft turbocharges the process — in place for several\nyears now — to select its next leader.\n\nBut, though the committee is headed up by John Thompson, CEO of Virtual Instruments and the former CEO of security\nsoftware giant Symantec, most expect Gates — as usual — to be the key decision maker on that choice, too.\n\nA Microsoft spokesman declined comment.\n\nBack to top\n\nThe Decline of E-Empires\nPaul Krugman — New York Times\n\nSteve Ballmer’s surprise announcement that he will be resigning as Microsoft's C.E.O. has set off a huge flood of\ncommentary. Being neither a tech geek nor a management guru, | can’t add much on those fronts. | do, however, think |\nknow a bit about economics, and | also read a lot of history. So the Ballmer announcement has me thinking about network\nexternalities and Ibn Khaldun. And thinking about these things, I’d argue, can help ensure that we draw the right lessons\nfrom this particular corporate upheaval.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019421\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

If you swap religious words for non-religious but moral words such as civic,\nduty, jury, court and police, you get the same results: people give more money when thinking about these\nmorally-pregnant, but non-religious words. It is also the case that if you paste up a photograph of eyes\nnext to a money box for coffee, people give more than with a photograph of flowers. What these two\nstudies show is that words and images that make us think about others, especially the possibility that\nothers are watching, turns us into bigger spenders. These psychological transformations are not, however,\nspecific to religion. Some may think that God is watching, but they and others may also think of a white-\nbearded, gavel-wielding, atheistic judge.\n\nWe learn three important lessons from the study of tameness and religion, lessons that will propel\nour discussion of evil. First, distinguish what something evolved for from what it is used for. Second,\ndissect complicated traits down into their component parts as the parts, together with their inter-\ndependence, may have different evolutionary histories. Third, the combination of independently evolved\ncapacities can lead to novel adaptations and possibilities. Some combinations lead to altruistic and\nhumane compassion toward those we don’t know. Others lead to virulent hatred and annihilation of those\n\nwe do know. The brain’s promiscuity is a driving engine for both the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\nFrom the shackles of monogamy to the freedom of promiscuity\n\nMany years ago, some American friends of mine were married in a small village in Tanzania. After the\nwedding, they went to a local official who was responsible for providing a marriage certificate. On the\ncertificate were three choices, indicative of the type of marriage: Monogamous, Polygynous, and\nPotentially Polygynous. My friends chuckled, but aimed their pen with confidence at Monogamous.\nBefore they could ink the certificate, however, several Tanzanian men shouted out “NO! At least\nPotentially Polygynous. Give yourself the option.” Right, the option. The freedom to explore.\n\nAmong social animals, only a few species pair bond for life, or at least a very long time. This fact\nis equally true of the social mammals: less than 5% of the 4000 or so species are strictly monogamous.\nFor these rare species, most of their efforts to think, plan, and feel are dedicated to their partner; what’s\nleft over goes into finding food and avoiding becoming dinner. Life is much more complicated for the rest\n\nof the social animals. Their social and sexual relationships are more promiscuous, less stable and less\n\nHauser Chapter 1.

There’s something not a little miraculous\nin the way the networked tools to recombine DNA or hack computer code or design\nviral software are getting both more sophisticated and simpler. If earlier eras put\nepoch-making implements into human hands - the knife! the train! - our age is now\nplacing new, mind-shaping forces within instant reach.\n\nIn a networked world, economic or military power doesn’t come just from\ncontrolling territory or information alone. It comes, more and more, from this\nmatery of the temporal. Securing territory today does not, alone, solve many\nproblems of safety. Control of information, of topologies and finally of time - this is\nwhat matters most. Such temporal security will be elusive; always in need of\ndefense. The arrival of airpower in World War Two, for instance, shifted battles\nfrom two to three dimensions. “Only large states are able to resist three-dimensional\nenvelopment,” the historian Nicholas Spykman wrote in 1942.21! Even today, “Air\nSuperiority” is the precondition of nearly any American war. If we can dominate you\nfrom above, nearly anything seems possible. But networks add a fourth dimension.\n“Time Superiority.” Can you move faster than your enemy? Can you bog them down?\nOr are you a victim of fourth-dimensional envelopment. Control of time - yours,\nyour enemies - this will decide your strength.\n\n6.\n\nBack in the fall of 1988, at about the same moment that Danny Hillis and his team\nwere busy peddling their amazing Connection Machine - and trying to smash every\nworld computing speed record they could find - another device appeared in the\nworld of massively parallel super computers. It was, everyone who saw it agreed, an\nextremely strange machine. It’s appearance was completely unexpected. It’s\ndesigner was not a famous thinker about parallelism, cavorting with TV network\nfounders and physics Nobelists. In fact, its very success emerged from this strange\nface: The creator knew basically nothing about the sort of parallel design that\ninformed Hillis’ thinking. Which was strange, because it was far more “parallel” than\nthe Connection Machine could ever be. It was also cheaper. Simpler. And: It was\nfaster. In fact, it was the fastest parallel machine in history.\n\nThe machine began, quietly enough, in the mind of a 28-year old Cornell graduate\nstudent named Robert Tappan Morris. Morris came by his computer chops honestly\nenough: He was the son of Robert Morris Sr., the legendary NSA scientist we\nencountered several chapters ago, the man who penned those partly amusing, partly\n\n210 No one had heard: Edwin Grohe, “The Cyber Dimensions of the Syrian Civil War:\nImplications for Future Conflict”, Comparative Strategy (2015), 34:2,\n\n211 The arrival of airpower: Nicholas John Spykman, “Frontiers, Security and\nInternational Organization,” Geographical Review, Vol 32, No 3 (July 1942) p. 439\n\n144\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018376\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

If\nyour brain mirrors the neural activity in\nthe brain of someone you see acting, this\ncould provide a basis for understanding\nthe motivation for the action. If your\nbrain resonates to the observed action as\nif you were acting, this could call to\nmind previous experiences acting that\nway providing a memory for why you\nacted that way. That is, our social brain\nmay directly resonate to the actions of\nothers without reasoning explicitly about\nthose actions. This kind of mechanism,\nthrough which intentions might be\ninferred, could then prepare responses\nquickly to facilitate the smooth flow of\nsocial interactions whether in a game or\na dialogue. Of course, a critical aspect\nof such a mechanism is to differentiate\nour resonance to other people’s actions\nand the control of our own. This kind\nof neural system for mapping the actions\nand intentions of others has been\nidentified with a network of regions\ncalled the mirror neuron system °, and\nthis system may help to induce a degree\nof reflexive similarity or identification\nbetween self and other. The mirror\nneuron system appears to be\ncontinuously engaged unless it is\nactively suppressed by inhibition, so that\nthis system may continuous monitor the\nbehavior of ‘others’ in our social\nenvironment.\n\nOf course, mapping the\nmovements of the opponent is useful,\nbut certainly not sufficient to defend our\nposition, score a point, or win a match.\nOne needs to execute countermoves.\nThis is the domain of the motor system\nin the brain, which includes regions\ninvolved in the preparation and\nexecution of motor action. The motor\nsystem is responsible for the\nimplementation of one’s goals and\nintentions to perform an action®. Thus,\n\nPage | 60\n\nthe social brain includes monitoring and\nmotor systems that function in parallel.\nThe mirror system puts the player in the\nopponent’s shoes and monitors the\nopponent’s actions in an anticipatory\nmanner. Other parts of the social brain\nmaintain the distinction between player\nand opponent by shaping the\nimplementation of one’s actions, namely\nby engaging a counteraction.\n\nIn sum, a tennis game or any\nsocial interaction depends on a complex\nnetwork of brain regions that mediate\nperception and action, and the\nrelationship between observed action\nand one’s own behavior. The overlap in\nbrain regions responsible for these two\nimportant social functions suggests how\ntightly coupled and coordinated social\ninteractions can be. However, these two\nsystems cannot operate in isolation from\nour knowledge of the context in which\nbehavior occurs. We, therefore, turn to\nthis topic next.\n\nThe Social Context\n\nIn a tennis game or any social\ninteraction (e.g., dancing, conversation),\nthe behavior of one individual\nconstitutes a stimulus for others. If a\nbehavior is meaningful, then neural\nmechanisms responsible for social\nperception and social interaction are\nlikely to be activated to engage in\ncomplementary action. In a competitive\ncontext, such as the tennis game, the\nmotor system is engaged in the\npreparation and execution of\ncomplementary actions to those\nobserved and anticipated based on the\ninferred goals and intentions of the\ncompetitor. However, if everyone shares\nthe same goal, for example, as in an\naudience clapping, the neural systems\nfor monitoring the actions of others and\nexecuting one’s own actions can be\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021306\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The foreign officials visit Michigan for several days, during which the senior officials perform an\nappropriate inspection. Company A executives take the officials to a moderately priced dinner, a baseball game,\nand a play. Do any of these actions violate the FCPA?\n\nNo. Neither the costs associated with training the employees nor the trip for the senior officials to the Company's\nfacilities in order to inspect them violates the FCPA. Reasonable and bona fide promotional expenditures do not violate\nthe FCPA. Here, Company A is providing training to the Electricity Commission’s employees and is hosting the Electricity\nCommission senior officials. Their review of the execution and performance of the contract is a legitimate business purpose.\nEven the provision of business class airfare is reasonable under the circumstances, as are the meals and entertainment,\nwhich are only a small component of the business trip.\n\nWould this analysis be different if Company A instead paid for the senior officials to travel first-class with their\nspouses for an all-expenses-paid, week-long trip to Las Vegas, where Company A has no facilities?\n\nYes. This conduct almost certainly violates the FCPA because it evinces a corrupt intent. Here, the trip does not appear\nto be designed for any legitimate business purpose, is extravagant, includes expenses for the officials’ spouses, and therefore\nappears to be designed to corruptly curry favor with the foreign government officials.

Employees of Company A\naccede to the official's request, pay for the vacation, receive the confidential bid information, and yet still do not\nwin the contract.

How might Huang Hua, with his nature-of-the-age consideration of\nstrategy have regarded the matter? What does gatekeeping tell us?\n\nThe dominant view of future relations between Americans and Chinese generally\nruns along a nervously familiar historical track: An established power (the US) anda\nrising one (China) consider each other. Do they cooperate? Scratch at each other in\nconstant annoyance? Each nation possesses a different image the world. Each holds,\nas well, distinct pictures of their role. One power has enjoyed a long period of\nprosperity, has built and defended a global structure; the other, trod mercilessly\nunderfoot by history, feels the unbearable flow of power’s rising sap, a hunger for\nrecognition and release and for some, revenge; her economy craves resources, trade\nroutes, and markets. So Germany encountered and then attacked Great Britain at the\nturn of the 20 Century. Japan collided, similarly, with Russia in 1904. France taking\non Austria, Russia and Great Britain in the Napoleonic age.\n\nEven if the leaders of the United States and China intend to avoid conflict, they face\none of the most sobering, if not depressing, problems of international politics: The\n“security dilemma”. The world is a dangerous place. So countries do things to feel\nsafer. Their populations demand it. Germany looks at Britain’s imperial navy in the\n1890s: London could snap Berlin’s trade arteries. So the Kaiser orders two\nbattleships. Britain builds three in response. Germany turns to submarines. And so\non. Each country, chasing her own security, ends up /ess secure. This is the\n“dilemma”. The puzzle is like one of those woven wicker finger traps: The harder\neach side pulls to get out, the more stuck they become. America in 2012 pivots her\nmilitary gaze to Asia. China feels encircled. She orders a couple of aircraft carriers,\npaves remote islands into military bases. America flies aircraft closer to Chinese\nwaters. Are the two sides more secure? Collisions, arms racing, accelerating distrust\nbecome the threnody of contacts. Each side seeks something impossible: Perfect\nsecurity. Move first, certain forces begin to whisper in each capital.\n\nThe essence of this problem today, as the United States and China consider their\nfuture, is not merely or even mainly in the details of trade, territory, or cyber\ndisputes we read about. These hot points are important, of course, but they are\nsymptoms of differing judgments of the world, of a fracture at that first step of\nasking, “What is the nature of the age?” Americans generally believe the existing\nglobal power map is just, sustainable, in need — perhaps - of minor adjustments.\nAmerica engineered this system; benefits tremendously from it’s fictionless\noperation. China regards that same layout differently. As broken, unbalanced,\nrocking towards a seizure — and, anyhow, built, lubricated and run without her\nparticipation. This view is sharpened by ideology, national psychology and the bald\nfact that no global mechanism ever functions perfectly. The larger nature of the age\nis, many in Beijing feel, Da po, Da li. Great destruction. Great construction. Certainly\nthis is true inside China; it must be true outside. The nation has it’s hammers out.\nThey see the paradoxes of power we read about earlier, the inability to act and the\ncollapse of American credibility, as clearly as people in Washington or Damascus or\nMoscow. Surely the global system should be adjusted, they think. Tap. Tap.\n\n178\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018410\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

On January 7, 2003, Senators Kyl and Feinstein\nproposed the amendment as Senate Judiciary Resolution 1.

Conceding that the amendment had only majority support in Congress rather than the necessary\nsuper-majority, the advocates decided to press for a far-reaching federal statute protecting victims' rights in the federal criminal\njustice system. 54 In exchange for backing off from the federal amendment in the short term, victims’ advocates received near-\nuniversal congressional support for a \"broad and encompassing\" statutory victims’ bill of rights. 8° This new approach not only\nestablished a string of victims' rights but also provided funding for victims’ legal services and created remedies for the violation\nof victims' rights. 8° The victims' [*851] movement is currently evaluating the success of the statute before deciding whether\nto continue pushing for a federal amendment. */\n\nThe Crime Victims' Rights Act gives victims \"the right to participate in the system.\" °° To facilitate such participation, the Act\ngrants victims eight specific rights:\n\n(1) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused;\n\n(2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the\ncrime or of any release or escape of the accused;\n\n(3) The right not to be excluded from any such public court proceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and convincing\nevidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that\nproceeding;\n\n9% §.J.

While the oil price eased sharply over the past months, we\nexpect it to stabilize in the second half of 2012.

These skills have been developed\nover many years at some of Europe’s leading infrastructure operators and project financing firms which,\nwhen combined with the very specific infrastructure expertise of both the Edmond de Rothschild Group and\nBrisa, makes for a powerful and differentiated investment platform.\n\nTIIC Group operates from two offices in Lisbon and Paris, providing its team with access to relevant\ninvestment opportunities across key target markets in Europe as well as to leading industrial contractors,\noperators, advisors and financiers in the infrastructure industry.\n\nTIIC Group successfully raised a First Fund with €140m of commitments targeting transportation investments\nacross Europe. The portfolio of the First Fund comprises 6 assets located in Portugal, Spain, France and\nPoland. They represent a carefully balanced mix of greenfield and early stage brownfield projects in roads\nand car parks. TIIC Group has played an active role in the sourcing and development of all investments and\nhas made a significant contribution to value creation. TIIC Group believes that this is a high quality,\noperationally secure, cash yielding portfolio of assets which will be of strong interest to potential investors\nover the coming few years.\n\nTIIC has launched a successor fund, TIIC 2, which will build upon TIIC Group’ differentiated approach to\ninfrastructure in Europe. TIIC 2 will is targeting aggregate commitments from investors of €300m (€350m\nhard cap) to invest into both transportation and social infrastructure projects in Europe. TIIC 2 will also seek\nto invest, ona very selective basis, into greenfield social infrastructure projects in New Frontier Markets,\nwithin close proximity to the European Union. Given its powerful network of relationships across Europe and\nthe operational skills of its team, TIIC Group will continue to target superior investment returns for TIIC 2’s\nportfolio of assets.

The composite PMI is back close to the year highs too. The UK\nnumbers continue to surprise on the upside too for the moment. Our economists are\nalso upbeat on Japan with growth expected to accelerate next year as the fiscal stimulus\nkicks in.\n\nAccordingly our economists expect growth to rise from 3% this year to 3.5% in 2017\nand 3.8% in 2018. That acceleration in growth is despite a slightly slower US economy\nin the first half of the year as a higher USD and interest rates dampen growth before\nthe fiscal stimulus kicks in.

And as wretched as the \nU.S. economy seems, its not as bad as in other regions. \nThe International Monetary Fund's latest tally of world economic conditions forecasts a 2.6 decline in U.S. economic output for all of \n2009, and anemic growth of 0.8 percent in 2010. That's more optimistic than the IMF's prediction from three months ago, but those \nare still lousy numbers. A weak economy throughout 2010 would mean a bleak employment picture, an agonizingly slow housing \nrecovery, and another year or two likely to feel like a recession, whether its technically labeled that or not. \nWe should count ourselves lucky, though. The IMF expects at least 11 major parts of the world to have more severe economic \ncontractions than the United State this year, including most of western Europe, Japan, Russia, and Mexico. Europe will still be \nstumbling along behind the United States next year, as well. Here are the IMF's projections for economic growth in various parts of \nthe world: \n2009. 2010 \nChina. \t7.5. \t8.5 \nIndia. \t5.4 \t6.5 \nMiddle East 2.0 \t3.7 \nAfrica. 1.8 4.7 \nBrazil. -1.3 2.5 \nWorld total -1.4 2.5 \nCanada. \t-2.3 \t1.6 \nU.S. \t-2.6 \t0.8 \nFrance. \t-3.0 \t0.4 \nSpain. \t-4.0 \t-0.8 \nU.K. \t-4.2 \t0.2 \nE U. \t-4.7 \t-0.1 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021231 \nE Europe. -5.0 1.0 \nItaly. \t-5.1 \t-0.1 \nJapan. \t-6.0 \t1.7 \nGermany. \t-6.2 \t-0.6 \nRussia. \t-6.5 \t1.5 \nMexico. \t-7.3 \t3.0 \nIf these projections come true, it means the United States, despite its overspent consumers, wrecked banks, and insolvent auto \nmakers, will be leading the world economy out of recession. Somehow. The developing world will help, but those high growth \nprojections in China and India can be deceiving. \nChina in particular has government policies that practically mandate high growth, and 8.5 percent in 2010 would be just about the \nbare minimum to keep employment at tolerable levels. And neither China nor India is a major buyer of American-made goods and \nservices; for the most part, its the other way around. With much of the developed world trailing the United States, it will take \nAmerican consumers to ratchet up demand for the world's products. Scary thought. \nHow to tell when a real recovery begins.? \n4 Ways to Tell When a Real Recovery Has Begun \nYou could conclude just about anything from the daily cavalcade of economic statistics. Some suggest an imminent recovery. Others \nseem to foretell years of gloom. The bent of the expert interpreting the latest news—bull, bear, Obama-basher, Wall Street-hater—\nhas as much to do with the outlook as the numbers themselves. \nFor the foreseeable future, there will be an aggressive hunt for two economic recoveries. One is the technical improvement in \neconomic indicators that signals the economy is growing again. That's the one economists care about, which is why they scour the \nnumbers on retail sales, business inventories, purchasing manager sentiment, subatomic inflation, the mood in Shanghai, and \nanything else that could help pinpoint the exact inflection point for a turnaround. \nThe other recovery, the one that most consumers are waiting for, is the one in which companies stop firing and start hiring, banks \nreturn to normal lending, and families stop worrying about jobs and income. And that turnaround—the consumer recovery—is likely \nto take much longer to materialize than the technical recovery. \nThe danger of hyping a technical recovery is that it will arrive, with much fanfare—but fail to make ordinary consumers feel better \noff. Many economists, for example, are predicting that the recession will officially end by this summer or fall. The only problem is \nthat when a technical recovery begins, a lot of companies fail to get the memo. They don't play along; they keep payrolls lean and \nmaybe even continuing to lay off workers. So to guard against false optimism, here's how to tell when a real recovery is finally \nkicking into gear: \nUnemployment improves. The single best indicator of the health of the economy is the job market. People who have lost their job, or \nworry that they might, obviously hoard their money and don't spend. That spells doom for an economy driven by consumer spending, \nas ours is. But once its clear that jobs are coming back, consumers are more likely to relax and open their wallets. \nProjections about unemployment should make anybody queasy about the prospects for a recovery this year. The unemployment rate \nis currently 9.4 percent, a steep rise from one year ago, when it was an unremarkable 5.5 percent. And by most accounts, its going to \nget worse. The International Monetary Fund expects the U.S. unemployment rate to be 10.1 percent in 2010. Economist Gary \nShilling thinks unemployment will hit 11.4 percent and not peak until late next year. \nIts hard to imagine a \"recovery\" in which jobs are even more scarce than they are now. When the unemployment rate finally starts to \ngo in the other direction, we can start to think about putting the umbrellas away. Until then, no number of upticks or volume of \noptimistic talk will persuade Americans worried about their jobs that they should part with precious cash. \nHousing prices stabilize. This has become a mantra by now: For the economy to get healthy, housing prices must stop falling. \nProblem is, the houses haven't been listening. \nHousing matters for two reasons: It represents a big chunk of the economy, and its the largest single repository of Americans' \nhousehold wealth. With prices falling, buyers are scarce, since nobody wants to buy an expensive good today if its going to be worth \nless tomorrow. With few buyers, all the other economic activity that swirls around real estate—remodeling, appliance and furniture \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021232 \nsales, relocation services—is depressed. Homeowners are worse off, too, because the value of one of their vital assets is eroding. \nHouse prices have already fallen by 32 percent nationwide from the 2006 peak. And they have further to go. The latest readings on \nthe S&P/Case-Schiller home price index, one prominent measure, showed another record decline in May. At some point, the declines \nwill moderate and stop being records. But prices need to stop falling altogether, and probably rise, for a real recovery to happen. The \nFederal Reserve thinks home prices could stop falling in 2010, after a total decline of 41 to 48 percent. Other metrics, like housing \nstarts and new-home sales, might point upward before then. Those will be signs of signs of a turnaround, not the real thing. \nHousehold wealth increases. The housing bust and the volatile stock market have hammered the traditional investment tools that \nmost Americans use, causing epic declines in the wealth of Americans. Since 2006, household net worth has declined by about $12 \ntrillion, which equates to about $107,000 of lost wealth for each of America's 112 million households. That's partly because of the 40 \npercent plunge in the stock market since October 2007 and partly because of the steep declines in real estate values. \nAmericans simply own less, too. Home equity for the typical homeowner is just 41.1 percent, a record low. In 2002, it was 58.4 \npercent. Owning less means we owe more and will have to rebuild savings before we can spend like we used to. \"This will be a drag \non all discretionary purchases,\" says Dirk van Dijk, an analyst at Zacks Investment Research who thinks the tightfistedness will cut \ninto the earnings of firms ranging from hotel chains to furniture makers to motorcycle manufacturers. Those are the same kinds of \ncompanies that need to start hiring again for a real recovery to develop. But they won't if sales stay sluggish. A turnaround will \nrequire sustained stock market gains and an end to the housing bust. \nPresident Obama stops fudging on the economy. There's still a lot that could go wrong, and Obama knows it. Yet part of the \npresident's job is to reassure skittish Americans, even as his economic lieutenants are fighting battles in the war room. That's why \nObama has been making half-hearted pronouncements, like saying that the economy shows \"some return to normalcy\" and that \"we \nexpect there'll be some stabilization of the economy.\" Virtually all of Obama's remarks on the economy contain modifiers and future \ntense and a not-quite-there-yet quality, since hell blow his own credibility if he tries to convince Americans that they're better off \nthan they actually are. When Obama starts hedging less, be happy. That will signal better days. Finally. \nThe IMF does offer a bit of more heartening news: The global wipe out finally seems to be receding. \"The world economy is \nstabilizing,\" the IMF reports. Its global economic growth projection of 2.5 percent in 2010 is 0.6 points higher than predicted in \nApril. But the global economy isn't expected to gain its footing in earnest until the second half of 2010. Maybe by then American \nspenders will have come out of hiding. \nObama says stimulus plan to kick in later this year Reuters \nObama says stimulus plan to kick in later this year \nBy Tom Doggett — Sat Jul 11, 3:13 pm ET \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) — President Barack Obama said Saturday more time was needed for his $787 billion stimulus package to \nwork, predicting the spending would have a bigger impact on the economy later this year. \nIn an advanced text of his weekly radio speech, Obama said the stimulus plan approved by Congress and signed into law in mid-\nFebruary \"was not designed to work in four months -- it was designed to work over two years.\" \nU.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said it was too soon to decide whether the U.S. economy needed the help of a second-\nround of government stimulus to recover from recession. \n\"I don't think that's a judgment we need to make now, can't really make it now prudently, responsibly,\" he said in a taped interview \nwith CNN that will air Sunday. \nAccording to a transcript provided by CNN, Geithner said the \"biggest thrust\" of the stimulus package signed into law earlier this \nyear would take effect in the second half of the year. \nObama's comments follow government data showing the unemployment rate soared to 9.5 percent in June, the highest level since \n1983 and above the 8 percent peak predicted by the White House when it worked with Congress to pass the package.

THREE\nmonths later, the FBI and the same AUSA that had headed my prosecution set up my\nhouseman in a sting. It appears that while using a lawyer from the RRA firm, Brad\nEdwards, as a confidential informant for the government at the same time that Scott\nRothstein was using me and the allegations against me to fleece his victims, the US\nattorneys’ office was sitting in the Rothstein offices planning a sting operation, while\nright next door, Scott Rothstein was making off to Morocco in an attempt to flee the\ncountry. Alfredo Rodriguez was prosecuted by the same AUSA and received an 18-\nmonth sentence; however, it also appeared that on the very same day of his sting\narrest, he bought an illegal gun, and was later sentenced to four years in prison.\nWho Cara Holmes is, and what her role was in RRA is still a mystery to us. She\nappears to be a former FBI agent out of the Chicago office. She joined the Rothstein\nfirm in May of 2009, and joined the Florida Bar at the same time. She attended\ndepositions of my pilots and my houseman. She communicated regularly with Brad\nEdwards and the investigators on my case. The email traffic is extensive.\n\nThe telephone book that sy Rodriguez had stolen from my house was then\nturned over(by the government?) to the same attorneys who had been told they\ncould not buy it as s they would have been buying stolen property. Brad Edwards, the\nformer partner of Scott Rothstein, then used the purloined book to send out letters\nto everyone in the book, asking for additional stories of my wrongdoing in the past\nfive years with the hopes of getting new clients. The letter was structured so as to\ncircumvent the ethical rules regarding trolling for clients.\n\nWhile I was serving my sentence, my lawyers were able to come see me in jail. Only\ntwo months after being incarcerated, my in house lawyer came to see me to tell me\nthat we were now conducting an audit of legal fees paid to date. They had\ndiscovered that Gerald Lefcourt, my primary attorney, had taken out cash to\nthe tune of $800,000, that according to his own accountant, he was not entitled to.\nHe had simply prepared invoices that said, “Please pay another $100,000 or\n$200,000”. Though he had been asked on multiple occasions to substantiate the\nbills, his response would be, “We are working full time for you”. I pointed out that\nhis was not the only firm working for me, but he replied, “Would you like me to\nquit?” He eventually returned over $400,000 over a period of time, as he said that\nhis cash flow could not handle the strain. He said that he was still owed for things\nlike taxi fair, coffee and doughnuts, detailed for $2.53, and would keep $400,000.\n\nI was told that I should hire Guy Lewis, a former US Attorney in the Southern\nDistrict. Lewis, a southern style gentleman; white suits, fast cars; said he had a great\nrelationship with the current US Attorney, Alex Acosta, and the people in\nWashington that would potentially need to review what ever happened in South\nFlorida.

And hybrid systems, as we shal\nsee, are somewhat diverse in this regard: some rely heavily on cognitive synergies and others\nconsist of more loosely coupled components.\n\nWe now review the DeSTIN emergentist architecture in more detail, and then turn to the\ndevelopmental robotics architectures.\n\n4.3.1 DeSTIN: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to AGI\n\nThe DeSTIN architecture, created by Itamar Arel and his colleagues, addresses the problem\nof general intelligence using hierarchical spatiotemporal networks designed to enable scalable\nperception, state inference and reinforcement-learning-guided action in real-world environments.\nDeSTIN has been developed with the plan of gradually extending it into a complete system for\nhumanoid robot control, founded on the same qualitative information-processing principles as\nthe human brain (though without striving for detailed biological realism). However, the practical\nwork with DeSTIN to date has focused on visual and auditory processing; and in the context of\nthe present proposal, the intention is to utilize DeSTIN for perception and actuation oriented\nprocessing, hybridizing it with CogPrime which will handle abstract cognition and language.\nHere we will discuss DeSTIN primarily in the perception context, only briefly mentioning the\napplication to actuation which is conceptually similar.\n\nIn DeSTIN (see Figure 4.4), perception is carried out by a deep spatiotemporal inference\nnetwork, which is connected to a similarly architected critic network that provides feedback on\nthe inference network’s performance, and an action network that controls actuators based on the\nactivity in the inference network (Figure 4.5 depicts a standard action hierarchy, of which the\nhierarchy in DeSTIN is an example). The nodes in these networks perform probabilistic pattern\nrecognition according to algorithms to be described below; and the nodes in each of the networks\nmay receive states of nodes in the other networks as inputs, providing rich interconnectivity\nand synergetic dynamics.\n\n4.3.1.1 Deep versus Shallow Learning for Perceptual Data Processing\n\nThe most critical feature of DeSTIN is its uniquely robust approach to modeling the world\nbased on perceptual data. Mimicking the efficiency and robustness by which the human brain\nanalyzes and represents information has been a core challenge in AI research for decades. For\ninstance, humans are exposed to massive amounts of visual and auditory data every second\nof every day, and are somehow able to capture critical aspects of it in a way that allows for\nappropriate future recollection and action selection. For decades, it has been known that the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012982\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I've just been. \nYou will never think the same way about anything again.\" \nSo spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up \neverywhere at the moment as the alleged \"procurer\" of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. \nEpstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of \nanother investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with \nallegations that he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British \nnewspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein's friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to \npublicly disassociate himself from his old pal. \nI wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called \"The Talented Mr. Epstein.\" It was largely a business piece that \nfocused on his mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les \nWexner, the chairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude \nHoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of \n$450 million. \nThe piece alluded to Epstein's great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women \nwith whom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the \nissue that remains a mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. \nThis is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I \nconcentrated on the intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same \nones, different ones. And their stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one \ncase, flown—to ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? And the British, especially, want to know: Who \nis she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, my 2003 Vanity Fairstory \nthat really brought him into the limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself. \nBizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept \nrunning into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of \nyoung women with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. \"Do they speak?\" I remember \nasking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. \"Not like you,Vicky,\" was his riposte. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030472 \nI remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn't \nstudied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at \nhome via messenger. It was a book: \"Math for idiots.\" \nSo he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. \n\"Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects,\" newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He \nwas certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few \nmoments in his company and you know this to be true. \nWhen I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that \n\"Andy\"—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his \nstrange title is. Because if one thing's for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what \nhe's talking about far more than \"Andy\" does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other \nfinanciers hang out with him. \nAnd Ghislaine? \nFull disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It's almost impossible not to. \nShe is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hours \ntalking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is \ncurious. She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent \nme a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else's I can think of—probably even \nRupert Murdochs'. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill \nClinton with whom she is close friends. \nYet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-\nPlatero, (known fondly to her close friends as \"the Tennis Goddess\") Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When \nit comes down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability. \nAnd that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey. \n\"He saved her,\" I remember a close friend of mine telling me. \"When her father died, she was a wreck; \ninconsolable. And then Jeffrey took her in. She's never forgotten that—and never will.\" \nIn many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect \nreplacement for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his \nsexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine's father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving \na massive \"black hole\" he'd fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that \nstrange. \nIn fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful \npeople in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl \nissues, and moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You \ndon't tend to get to the top by being the world's most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett \ndidn't quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second \"wife\" for many years whose existence he \nhas been open about. \nSo what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her \nloyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look \nat Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for \nall sorts of blemishes. \n--\n*********************************************************** \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030473 \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

The 35-page Defense Intelligence Agency’s damage assessment, for example, that said\nthat 900,000 Pentagon documents were compromised by Snowden, was not made public. It was\nonly disclosed via a Vice magazine Freedom of Information request in June 2015.\n\nWhat is known is the number of documents that Snowden gave to journalists in Hong\nKong. As will be recalled, Poitras and Greenwald were “writing partners.” When Greenwald\ndiscovered that his copy of the documents were corrupted, Poitras made a copy of the thumb\ndrive that Snowden gave her in Hong Kong and sent it to her Greenwald in Rio de Janeiro by a\ncourier. That courier was intercepted by British authorities at Heathrow Airport. When\nexamined, the Poitras-Greenwald thumb drive contained some 58,000 documents. This meant\nthat the lion’s share of the 1.3 million documents that the NSA claimed were compromised had\nnot been given to journalists and is unaccounted for.\n\nThe numbers game is not only misleading nut unenlightening on the issue of the value of the\ncompromised documents. Many of the putative 1.3 million documents that the NSA says were\ncopied and moved were duplicate copies. Others were outdated or otherwise useless routing data.\nSo the quantity does not tell the story. Of far more importance than the quantity of the total haul\nis the quality of some of the data that Snowden had copied. Just a single one of these documents\ncould cripple not just the NSA but America’s entire multi-billion dollar apparatus for intercepting\nforeign intelligence. The previously-cited summary of requests by the CIA, FBI, Pentagon and\nother agencies for communications intelligence, for example, which was 31,000 pages long, listed\nall the gaps in U.S. coverage of adversaries, including those cited by President Obama’s national\nsecurity team. As Ledgett warned, this single document, if it fell into enemy hands, would provide\nout adversaries with “a roadmap of what we know what we don’t know and imp/licitly a way to\nprotect themselves.” The “roadmap” was not found among the files on the thumb drive. Nor\nwere most of the missing level 3 lists concerning NSA activities in Russia and China found on the\nthumb drive, even though Snowden said he took taken his final job at Booz Allen to get access to\nthese lists. If Snowden had not given these documents to Poitras, Greenwald or other journalists,\nwhere were they?\n\nThe compartment logs showed that Snowden copied and transferred these level 3 documents in\nhis final week at the NSA. He presumably had them in his possession in Hong Kong after he\narrived on May 20, 2013. On June 3™, according to Greenwald, he was still sorting through the\nmaterial to determine which ones were appropriate to give to journalists. On June 12\" 2013, he\ntold reporter Lana Lam in Hong Kong that he was going through the documents, country by\ncountry, to determine which additional ones he should pass on to journalists. Eleven days later, he\ndeparted Hong Kong for Moscow carrying at least one laptop computer. Even after arriving in\nMoscow, he suggested he still had NSA secrets in his possession. \"No intelligence service — not\neven our own — has the capacity to compromise the secrets I continue to protect, “ he wrote to\nformer Senator Gordon Humphrey, “I cannot be coerced into revealing that information, even\nunder torture.\" Much of the material he copied while working at Booz Allen remained, as far as\nthe NSA could determine, missing.

On 6 October 1973, Syria and Egypt launched a war against Israel\nthat ended in a political stand-off between Israel and its Arab adversaries.\n\nIn November 1977, Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat broke Arab unity when he—\nin a move which stunned the world—flew to Israel and addressed the Knesset in a bid\nfor a peaceful resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Subsequently, in 1978, he signed\nthe Camp David Accords that established a separate bilateral peace agreement with\nIsrael.\n\nCamp David highlighted the importance of a third-party broker. When President\nSadat and his counterpart, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel, reached a\nstalemate, US President Jimmy Carter invited the parties to his presidential estate for\ntrilateral discussions on 5 September 1978. Three scheduled days of negotiations\nturned into thirteen days of frustrating and intense talks. Since these tripartite discus-\nsions were unable to break the impasse, President Carter decided to work separately\nwith both sides. The result was an American proposal which incorporated the require-\nments of both parties into a single text. After lengthy negotiations on this document,\nPresident Carter’s shuttle diplomacy resulted in the Camp David Accords of 17\nSeptember 1978.\n\nIn 1993, PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat followed the precedent of President Sadat and\nbroke ranks with fellow Arab leaders by secretly and bilaterally recognizing the State of\nIsrael and signing the Oslo Accords. The year after, building on the agreements\nbetween Israel and the PLO, King Hussein of Jordan followed suit by negotiating a\nbilateral peace treaty with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel. This culminated in a\nspectacular signing ceremony at the desert border crossing of Wadi Araba in August\n1994. In the agreement, Israel acknowledged Jordan’s historical role over Muslim holy\nsites in Jerusalem and agreed to recognize this role in future permanent status\nnegotiations with the Palestinians. The two leaders also agreed on steps such as the\nopening of border crossings and economic cooperation.\n\nIn 1999, Labor Party leader Ehud Barak defeated incumbent Prime Minister Benja-\nmin Netanyahu. As has been described above, the new Prime Minister broke radically\nwith the concept of gradualism that had been the hallmark of negotiations between\nYasir Arafat and three Israeli Prime Ministers, Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres, and\nBenjamin Netanyahu, favoring a more comprehensive approach to the peace process.\nFor the first half of 2000, Arafat and the Palestinians were left to wait for a Syrian peace\ndeal that was not to come. Despite Barak offering Syrian President Hafez al-Assad 99\nper cent of the Golan Heights, it still fell short of Assad’s demand for a return to the 4\nJune 1967 lines, and the Syria track subsequently crumbled. This put Arafat on the\nspot: how could he now, in front of the Arab world, accept less for the Palestinians than\nAssad had demanded for the Syrians?\n\nThe Lebanon track fared better. It began in late 1999 with a dialogue between Prime\nMinister Barak and me, as the newly appointed UN Special Coordinator for the Middle\nEast peace process. The Prime Minister confided to me that, as a part of his compre-\nhensive quest for resolving all the conflicts that Israel had with its neighbors, he wanted\nto end Israel’s occupation of Southern Lebanon that had started in 1978.

As shown in\nthe chart below, effective Federal tax rates for low earners have dropped to zero over the last decade, even after including FICA\ntaxes.

Source: Tax Policy Center.\n\nEurope: Finally (1!), but now what?\n\nFor the first time since 2009, it felt last week like European policymakers were trying to get out in front of things. In exchange\nfor a modest amount of “private sector involvement”, Germany agreed to more generous financing terms for Greece, Ireland\nand Portugal, and an expanded role for the EU-IMF lending facility (see following page). What would the plan accomplish if\nimplemented? While Greek debt to GDP ratios would remain well over 125% of GDP (the IMF estimate for next year is a\nridiculous 170%), Greece’s near-term financing obligations would decline, due to debt buybacks, exchanges into long maturity\nbonds, and interest grace periods on new EU loans. More broadly, the plan also allows for money to be lent to countries before\nthey enter into an IMF program, for recapitalization of banks. All things considered, it’s the broadest defense of the\nMonetary Union so far. On paper, it even looks like a free ride for holders of Greek paper that don’t participate in the debt\nexchanges (they would be paid at par). So, what’s not to like? Well, there are still questions about Greece:\n\ne ©There’s a big difference between generous financing terms and generous economic terms. Greece must still meet an\nenormous 5%-6% primary budget surplus target (government revenues less spending, pre-interest) during a recession\n\ne Greece must execute on its asset sale targets, despite having little success or experience doing this in the past\n\ne Banks listed in the ITF document (the committee representing them) are under no binding legal obligation to participate in\nthe debt exchanges, and may turn out to own less Greek debt than currently believed. [Note: bank participation in the Latin\nBrady bond era was high, since at the time, banks held almost all the paper, and in the form of illiquid loans].\n\nThe big question: would Germany still live up to the deal if Greece missed deficit targets or assets sales, if bank participation\nwas too low, or if hedge funds (once referred to by the Chairman of the German Social Democratic Party as a “swarm of\nlocusts”) reaped large free rider windfalls? Ultimately, this is a political question. If “yes”, Germany will underwrite Greece\nno matter what; if “no”, then a broader, coercive Greek restructuring might follow in the not-so-distant future’.\n\n> This could get complicated. If there is a need for further debt forgiveness for Greece, will policymakers find a way to “ring-fence” the\nbanks that participated in the first round, and impose losses just on the hold-outs? Will the EU tell banks that if they don’t participate, their\nolder bonds will not be eligible for financing at the ECB? >\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025222\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He has been a producer of several documentary films and assists numerous non-profit \norganizations. He is the author of The Control Factor: Our Struggle to See the True Threat. \nFP: Bill Siegel, welcome to FrontPage Interview. \nCongratulations on this brilliant book. It is without question one of the most vital works of our time. \nLet's begin with what inspired you to write it. \nSiegel: Thanks for having me Jamie. As a young boy born in the mid 1950s, I was fascinated with footage of \nHitler and the Third Reich and could never understand how the Jews of the time could not see the evil that \nseemed so obvious. Not yet appreciative of the benefit of hindsight, I could not comprehend the blindness. \nFollowing 9/11, like so many others, I began to study Islam, its history, its current movements, terrorism and \nso on. As I would learn one stunning aspect after another, I would discuss them with friends and associates. \nRather than confront the facts I would present, they would find one clever way after another to avoid the \nfrightening truth of what America and the West truly face. Their fear appeared obvious to me. I began to \ncatalog many of my friends' different maneuvers to dispel the anxiety that they found so difficult to endure. \nThe more I focused on their mental processes (as well as my own) the more I began to see a structure to the \nmental endeavor and to understand what I had, as a child, found so difficult to explain. \nFP: Tell us about the Control Factor, what you describe as \"that effort our minds enga ge in in order to keep \nus blind\" and that \"process of a voiding seeing the threats we face.\" It's also about, as you state, trying to \nbelieve that the threat is under our control, when in fact it is not. Kindly enlighten us as to these profound \ninsights you make in terms of the Control Factor. \nSiegel: First, let's distinguish the \"real world\" where real battles are taking place from the mental battlefield \nwhich occurs in each of our minds. We tend to believe our perceptions are simply clear realizations of what is \n\"out there\" and overlook how much our internal worlds can literally determine what we see. When our \ninternal minds become anxious and sense a loss of \"control,\" they tend to concoct ways to distort our \nperceptions so as to restore that sense of inner control. I describe the Control Factor as an \"active and \ncontinuous process\" designed to maintain that sense, if not illusion, of control. We natural ly think that our \nthinking and feeling processes are passive; that they just happen. Yet when faced with truly frightening \nprospects, the mind is geared to actively distort. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024408 \nSimilarly, the sense of control must be continuously maintained so the Control Factor operates constantly. In \nturn, the sum of this active and continuous undertaking makes these perceptions all the more familiar and thus \nseemingly all the more \"real.\" In one sense, the Control Factor is the mechanism of what Andy McCarthy \nentitled one of his numerous excellent books- willful blindness. The Control Factor is cleverer than we are \naware; that is almost tautological as, if our minds are to create ways to keep us in denial, they must out \nmaneuver our conscious thinking. \nSince World War II, America has had limited experience with threats coming to the homeland. Most of \nAmerica's history has been about \"over there,\" where we have always known that if things got too out of \nhand (e.g. Vietnam) we could always ret urn home. The current generations, for a wide array of reasons, have \nhad virtually no experience with a threat to this land. (The documentary, Generation Zero, is interesting on \nthis point). \nConsequently, the process of waking up to such a threat parallels the arc of a typical horror film. In such a \nfilm, there is typically a cast of characters surrounding one or two main characters. We in the audience know \nthere is a threat coming — be it a monster, a virus, a psycho killer, an alien, the blob that ate Cincinnati etc. \nThis threat is typically defined by its intent- the singular goal of destroying the characters. Much of the initial \nexposition shows how the characters first are oblivious to the destruction the threat brings about, then explain \nit in familiar terms only to finally open their eyes to see that something uniquely terrifying is happening. The \nnext stage usually involves a series of failed attempts to deal with the threat- fr om trying to negotiate with it, \nto appease it, to coax it, to threaten it with ineffective weapons and so forth. Most of these failings are due to \nnot adequately appreciating the threat for what it truly is and projecting onto it a host of other attributes \ninstead. The final stage generally involves a back-up-against-the-wall decision by whichever characters \nremain alive. I named this the \"turnaround moment\" when the character becomes willing to be as ruthless as \nthe threat. That change in mental state is necessary to ensure survival. Ultimately, the storyline is a race for \nwhichever characters remain to wake up fully and use whatever advantages they may still have to beat the \nthreat. \nThis is the same arc our minds go through in battling our own Control Factors, our own compulsions to deny \nthat which is staring us in the face. Ultimately, the question is whether we will be able to wake up while we \nstill have advantages and give ourselves permis sion to fully fight the battle we are in. \nI said ear her that there is a structure to the Control Factor. To oversimplify, I view it much as a pyramid \nwhere on the bottom are the many minute by minute thoughts that are manipulated. I call this level of \nmaneuvers the many \"D's\" as they include the psychological defenses such as distortion, denial, \ndemonization, deflection, deletion, detachment, delusion, displacement, discolorization and so forth. Layered \nupon these are moves such as projection, where we can assign to our Islamic Enemy traits we wish to see in \nthem or introject traits from them into ourselves that we wish not to acknowledge. These maneuvers involve a \nmixing of identities where we actually lose clarity about who we are and who the enemy is. Projection and \nintrojection are active almost across the board. It is always helpful, for instance, to ask how what the enemy \naccuses us of is more appropriately descriptive of it. When we add Western Guilt and Shame, our need to be \nliked, and o ther psychological dimensions, basic thoughts solidify into larger fantasies. \nAs these narratives (\"Our courts will never allow that,\" \"As a superpower we will always be able to win any \nfight we put our minds to,\" \"Assimilation will ensure Muslims are westernized\" ...) gain consent from others \nthey tend to guide us deeply and become infused on our policies. Ultimately, what emerges is a relationship \nwe take with our Islamic Enemy that parallels that between an addict and an enabler. Emblematic of this \nrelationship is the \"transfer of responsibility\" in which we assume responsibility for the enemy's behavior \nwho is addicted to transferring it away from itself The Control Factor actively maintains this relationship and \nmakes changing that relationship as difficult a chore as any addict finds in breaking his addiction. And just as \nan addict needs to devote serious effort and con sciousness to his addiction, so must we devote great energy to \nunders tanding how the Control Factor ultimately sabotages us. \nFP: Describe the threat we face in our Islamic enemy. And you talk about the three levels of jihad against us. \nWhat are they? \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024409 \nSiegel: Simply stated, our Islamic Enemy seeks the totalitarian domination of Islam throughout the world — \nIslamic supremacy. It seeks to have the West submit to Islam. Obviously, this does not mean that everybody \nbecomes a Muslim. Islam, in all its varied expressions, permits dhimmis- those Christians, Jews, and some \nothers who are permitted to remain as protected non-Muslims as long as they submit to an inferior status. \nWhat is critical is that Shariah (Islamic Law) ultimately rules the world. \nJihad, loosely, is the effort/struggle to see this vision through. The most obvious method of Jihad is through \nviolence; it is the one most familiar to most Westerners and almost all of the Koranic references to Jihad are \nbased in violence. The Violent Jihad includes al-Qaeda and its offshoots as well as other groups that formed \naround the globe independent of al-Qaeda. It also obviously includes the violence from Islamic nations such \nas the Islamic Republic of Iran whose constitution specifies such vision. It also includes, however, various \nmilitant groups and training camps here in the US as well as ad hoc efforts of individuals. \nSince 9/11, there have been something in excess of 15,000 Violent Jihadic attacks across the globe. However, \nas terrible as this is, we have a tendency in the West to think that the only dimension of threat we face comes \nfrom violence. While the Bush administration helped initiate this thinking, the Obama administration has \nactively abused it by limiting any discussion of the threat we face to al-Qaeda and some other terrorist groups \nabroad. As frightening as these groups are, we can get some ease from thinking they are a band of \"extremists \nlimited in number, weaponry, sophisticati on, and means. Stunningly, Hillary Clinton recently estimated that \nthere are only about 50,000 \"homicidal\" violent extremists around the world who simply have been able to \nproject power much greater than their number should allow. Here the Control Factor makes the threat appear \nmore easily manageable. \nJihad, however, is pursued in other often even more effective ways which I have grouped into three \"levels.\" \nA second more insidious level of threat is what the Muslim Brotherhood itself called the \"Civilization Jihad.\" \nIt is the effort to infiltrate all aspects of our society, peacefully according to our laws, in order to later be in \nposition to sabotage and destroy it from the inside. The Civilization Jihadists have learned the culture and \nrules of the territories they seek to command and use those rules to maneuver—specifically using our \nfreedoms to destroy our freedoms. They use \"lawfare\" to seek changes in our laws so as to push Shariah into \nour society. Your readers should read Daniel Pipes and Brooke Goldstein's Lawfare Project material and \nothers to fully appreciate how cancerous this activity has become. This includes intimidating in a variety of \nways anyone who speaks out against them or Islam and seeking to squelch our treasured broad right to free \nspeech so as to ultimately prevent any criticisms of Islam. Once criticism of Islam is prohibited, little can stop \nit from cascading throughout the culture. \nThe Civilization Jihad includes situating such Jihadists in critical positions in the society, in the government, \nin the legal system, the military, and elsewhere. It includes the control over university programs that distribute \npropaganda about Islam and Islamic history which then filters down throughout textbooks for even younger \nstudents. It includes control over most of the nation's mosques and local Imams guiding the mess ages \nengaged Muslims are receiving. Most troublesome are the Muslim g roups (CAIR, ISNA, MSA and others \nassociated and/or joint venture partners with the Muslim Brotherhood) supposedly interested in \"outreach\" \nwhich know how to appear Westernized and interested in the goals of Western Civilization. They have fooled \na large part of our authorities and media due in part to their patience and willingness to chip away, one airport \nprayer room, one frivolous intimidating lawsuit, one Congressman or CIA officer, one mosque, one ruling at a \ntime. \nParticularly in the US, given our deep attachment to freedom as well as cultural and psychological tendencies \ntoward diversity, Western guilt and expectations of truthfulness, this effort is devious and difficult to uproot. \nThe Civilization Jihadists present one face to the American public which is completely at odds with their true \nagenda and how they deal in private. Jamie, you and David and others such as Steve Emerson, Frank Gaffney, \nAndy McCarthy and others have done s o much to uncover this level of Jihad that your readers should be \nurged to review as much of their work (including Steve's recent excellent documentary, The Grand  \nDeception,  and Frank's important web video course, The Muslim Brotherhood in America) as possible. \nFinally, there is a third level — the International Institutional Jihad. Here the most powerful international \ninstitutions such as the UN and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and others seek to push into America \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024410 \nfrom without those changes which are difficult to complete from within. The OIC is the largest Islamic \ninstitution in the world. It essentially controls the vote in the UN's General Assembly and thus explains in \npart the absurd and abject pro-Islamic, anti-Israel thrust of that organizat ion. This level seeks to use the \npower of Islamic nations to work fro m outside the West to force changes within the West. While there are \nvarious conflicts between many of the nations, being Islamic majority states, there is a great deal they agree \nupon which becomes the focus of these efforts. Just as the Obama administration is beginning to cooperate \nwith international efforts to control gun ownership, so has Hillary Clinton's Istanbul Process become a \ndangerous step in the effort to restrict speech critical of Islam by norm (or possibly even treaty) when it may \nnot be fully executable by domestic action alone. \nI should point out that Stephen Coughlin, the former Pentagon officer who has an important must-see \npresentation of Islamic Law, uses different names for these same three levels — Jihad, Dawa, and Ummah. \nHad I seen his work before I wrote my book I would have conformed to his categorizations. \nWe must learn how powerful language has become on all three levels. Words such as \"peace,. $B!1 \n\"freedom,\" \"terrorism,\" and phrases such as \"human rights\" have different meanings for us and for our \nIslamic Enemy. To oversimplify, \"peace\" is not something for now but that which comes when all the earth is \nsubmitting to Islam. In the context of battles, \"peace\" is at best a temporary ceasefire. \"Freedom\" is best \nunderstood as having the freedom to fully submit to Islam, not to choose whatever beliefs one desires while \nrespecting the same right in others. We've all seen how \"human rights\" and \"terror\" really only apply among \nMuslims, not to non-Muslims. Our enemy fully understands these differences and uses them at all levels to \nparalyze us. \nLook simply at how the phrase \"Israeli-Palestinian conflict\" has equalized the two parties, making it all the \neasier to ascribe features of one to the other and view the problem as a simple-to fix division of ass ets into \nstatehoods but for personality problems among the leaders. The simple truth is that this is and has always been \na one-sided Arab war against Israel as Ruth Wisse and others have described and, as Bibi Netanyahu made \nclear, the ONLY state truly at issue here has been the State of Israel that the Arabs have refused for over half \na century. Nonetheless, the Control Factor hypnotically abuses the mind's susceptibility to the intricacies of \nlanguage. \nEven the label \"Peace Process\" has been damaging language. While most focus upon the first word, turning \nthis into a \"process\" has helped ensure that peace is never obtained. It is more appropriately called the \n\"Extortion Process\" because all that results is that violence is used over decades to extract concessions from \nIsrael. \nThese three levels must be understood for their differences while united by a single goal. While these levels \noften op erate together and assist each other, we must avoid \"level confusion\" which the Control Factor \nemploys to curtail our fears. If the Obama narrative is swallowed- that the only threat is the Violent Jihad- we \nwill miss the other contamination fomenting within our borders. We must appreciate how these levels work \ntogether and even unite with other forces such as the global Leftist movement that you, Jamie, have described \nso forcefully in United in Hate. \nFP: You write about how we like to talk of \"Good Muslims\" and how we are always on the eternal search for \n\"moderate\" Muslims (Khatami, Mousavi, Abbas, etc), while we stress how the \"extremists\" are the real \nproblem and how \"few\" they really are. All of this is connected to the Control F actor. Enlighten us. \nSiegel: The Control Factor seeks to have us feel in control of the situation. The easiest way to do this is to \nsimply minimize the number of potential enemies. We have been lectured for years about how Islam is a \n\"religion of peace\" and that the violence we see (remember that we have already improperly limited the \nproblem to violence) is the product of a small number of \"crazies\" (remember Hillary Clinton's 50,000) who \nhave distorted Islam. I call this the \"Peaceful Muslim Disclaimer\" as virtually everyone in the press and \ngovernment has been bullied into making some statement of the kind to silence those who will pressure them \nthat they are \"Islamophobic\" and Islam is being attacked. (These are the Islam hustlers who operate on the \nsame principles that black race hustlers so effectively used to extort concessions over the last six decades or \nso). \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024411 \nNobody has done any real work to support this proposition, nor is it clear exactly how it would be tested. My \nview is that the grammar \"Islam is x\" is itself problematic because Islam has expressed itself throughout \nhistory in a variety of fashions. It is more useful to talk in terms of how seriously engaged with Islam, the \nKoran and other texts, a Muslim is. What is significant is how Muslims today are using Islam and most of \nthose who are in power either throughout a large territory or within a small community tend toward, if not \nfully advocate, the very supremacist ideas that we try to tell ourselves are reserved for the \nfew \"extremists.\" Presumably most Germans did not wish to see all Nazi atrocities carried out but in the end \nthey fell in line because they had to. Those our politicians and press call the \"extremists\" are in one sense \nmore accurately the \"good\" Muslims who ar e following their Islamic beliefs dutifully. \nFP: Tell us how Western shame and guilt play into all of this. \nSiegel: One of the dirty little secrets the Control Factor preys upon is that if we believe we control something \nwe can comfort ourselves that we can change it. Remember the horror film- the threat has one purpose and \nthat is to destroy you. You can not change it, talk it out of it, teach it alternatives or otherwise. That is what \nmakes it so inherently frightening. If we can convince ourselves that we caused the threat to act the way it \ndoes we can maintain the secret hope that we can change it. Consequently, there is a tremendous attraction to \nblaming ourselves for the Islamic Enemy's behavior. And we see this power in our readily accepting \nresponsibility for terror- because of our occupation, our greedy quest for oil, our failure to extend a hand of \n\"engagement,\" Israel's building settlements, our making videos that defa me Mohammed and so on. Again, \nthe relationship is defined by the enemy blaming us for his actions and our accepting such responsibility. \nShelby Steele has written brilliantly about what he calls \"white guilt\" and outlines how whites during the 60's \nand thereafter were pressured into a transaction whereby in order to re-obtain a sense of moral authority they \naccepted blame for the condition of blacks and behaved as if guilty. Blacks were able to extract great \nconcessions and whites were able to view themselves as morally restored and redeemed. At a certain point, \nhowever, the behavior takes on a life of its own and the narratives become deeply embedded in the culture \nand, as we can see today, difficult to uproot. \nWestern guilt is an extension of Steele's notion. President Obama's confessionals to the Arab world admitting \nthat America has made \"mistakes\" and was not born a colonial pow er express this same tendency to appease \nthrough guilt. Hillary Clint on's \"reset\" with Russia conveyed the same submissive request for a more \nacceptable response. In being guilty we presume the other party will recognize our contrition and respond in \nlike kind. One of the Control Factor's most devastating moves is employed- presuming the other is just like us \nand will respond the way we would. This is frequently how an enabler justifies his continuous support for an \naddict. The problem, however is that our Islamic Enemy is NOT like us and will not respond in like kind. \nRather, as we repeatedly refuse to learn, appeasement invites more abuse from an enemy. This becomes \nthe \"game of guilt;\" it tends to expand to greater and greater consequences. Paradoxically, psychological \ndefenses tend to create the very outcomes they seek to eliminate and it is no different here. It is a game we \nlove to play but, unfortunately, the game gives us no rules for how to end it. \nAll beha vior is instructive. That is, we teach others how to treat us. The game of guilt, along with other \nControl Factor tools, teaches our Enemy it is winning and to continue playing. \nFP: The reason Nidal Hasan was able to perpetrate his murder spree at Fort Hood is precisely because of our \nControl Factor. Please connect the dots for our readers. \nSiegel: Just as I used to look at Hitler when I was young and be amazed that no one could see what he was \nabout, in retrospect the same applies to Hasan. It is precisely all the elements of the Control Factor that could \nallow this man, a Soldier of Allah, to be positioned as he was. He was blatantly voicing his Islamist views and \nJihadi intent including, even, an essay recommending the \"painful liquidation\" of non-Muslims. Yet, in the \nArmy of all places, the Control Factor operated to allow and even foster his work. Even after the murders, we \ncont inue the denial by calling it \"workplace violence.\" He is the Civilization-Violent Jihad combo! And we \ncontinue to enable the same infiltration elsewhere. \nFP: Tell our readers about \"The Project\" and \"Explanatory Memorandum.\" These are realities that serve as \ngreat threats to the Control Factor, right? \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024412 \nSiegel: These are separate sets of documents that outline the Muslim Brotherhood's goals and \nplans underlying the Civilization Jihad. The former was discovered in Europe and extends globally. The 1991 \nExplanatory Memorandum emerged in 2008 from the Holy Land Foundation trial and describes the \nBrotherhood's work in America as a \"Civilization-Jihadist Process with all the word means\" and \"a kind of \ngrand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and 'sabotaging' its miserable \nhouse by their own hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God's religion is made \nvictorious over all other religions.\" \nMuch as the communists of the Soviet Union had formulated in the 1950s a detailed long term plan to \ndestroy America (many of the effects of which we are seeing of late including destroying the nuclear family, \nsecularizing the nation, feminizing men ...) these documents identify many strategies to infiltrate while \neroding the foundations of our civilization in order to transform it into an Islamic one. The Control Factor has \nmany ingenious ways to convince us that this is ridiculous, that our courts and system would never allow \nsuch a thing, that one is racist or \"Islamophobic,\" if not insane, for even thinking this is real. And just as with \nthe communists, time is plentiful. Even more so with our Islamic Enemy, a multi-decade plan is short term. It \nis not critical that a seriou sly engaged Muslim lives to see the result. It is critical, more correctly a duty, \nhowever, that he carries on his Jihad. Patrick Poole and The Center for Security Policy's Team B Report, \nShariah: The Threat to America, are excellent sources for your readers to pursue these documents. \nFP: And so what you call an \"Inner Jihad\" has to start. It's our, as you say, mandatory \"addiction treatment.\" \nPlease explain. \nSiegel: The \"Inner Jihad\" is the effort we must undertake to gain control over our Control Factors. There is a \nfamous Hadith in which Mohammad, returning from a successful battle, essentially says that the physical \nfight was the \"lesser Jihad\" and it is time to then attend to the \"greater Jihad 4\"- that internal battle against \nour own internal appetites, lusts, wrong thinking and so forth. While that Hadith has been falsely utilized to \nsay that \"Jihad\" is not violent, it is useful to us as a symbol of the vicious effort we must take internally \nagainst our own Control Factor tendencies. \nAs I said earlier, the Control Factor is \"active\" and \"continuous\" so we must constantly monitor and combat \nit. Like \"Whack-a-Mole,\" just as we may think we have addressed it, another variation pops right up. I use the \nterms \"addict\" and \"enabler\" because we truly need a form of rehab to break the habitual power of the \nControl Factor and because our relationship with our Islamic Enemy is very much like that between a typical \naddict and his enabler. And just as it is so difficult for an addict to kick his habit, so does the enabler act \nessentially addicted to his behavior and find it so difficult to change. At its core, the relati onship involves the \ntransfer of responsibility for our Islamic Enemy's hate and resultant actions onto us with our response framed \nessentially as an effort to do what we can to try to address the Enemy's grievance. (Your book, United in \nHate, describes this addiction to hate in detail. \nThe key to the Inner Jihad is to learn to transfer responsibility for our Islamic Enemy's hate and resultant \nactions back to it and take responsibility back for our own situation. We must learn all we can about the \nenemy. We must unwind our inappropriate projections and introjections and rediscover who we are and are \nnot. We must speak up. We must support those Muslims who promote expressions of Islam that are consistent \nwith our principles. And we must stalk the C ontrol Factor, constantly be on guard for its intrusion. This is an \nindividual endeavor as each of our Control Factors uses its own methods. The book gives plenty of examples \nof each maneuver discussed but it is important for each of us to discover the unique workings of his own \nmind. That takes the work of the Inner Jihad. \nFP: Share with our readers what you mean by the \"Turnaround Moment.\" \nSiegel: There is a moment in typical horror films where the central characters have been pushed to their limit. \nThey then change and fully embrace the willingness to be as ruthless as the threat they face. No more moral \nhigh ground; no more futile attempts to ignore or change the threat's essence. As Lee Harris described in The  \nSuicide of Reason, it is the willingness o r license to be (not necessarily actually being) as ruthless that is \ncritical. It is a mental state that sheds all the prior counter-productive efforts at denial to finally clearly focus \non the threat faced. Part of the Inner Jihad is to reach that Turnaround Moment sooner rather than later. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024413 \nFP: You suggest that \"mirroring\" should be used as part of our arsenal. Tell us about it. \nSiegel: Mirroring is a literal approach to transferring back to the addict responsibility that we have been \ninappropriately accepting. Critical to the addict/enabler relationship is asymmetry. Like the addict, the enemy \nuses a less limiting set of rules than we do. The enemy typically initiates aggression while we respond only. \nMirroring means that we demonstrate our willingness to act symmetrically, to be governed by the same rules. \nIt is stunning how much is accomplished when one's attitude simply is clear that he will do what is necessary; \noften not much else is needed as the addict or enemy realizes the game is fundamentally changed. But other \ntimes action is absolutely needed. Demonstrating that we are not afraid to treat the enemy as it treats us \ncarries great meaning. Imagine (international law aside) if Israel announced that from now on it will mirror \nHamas such that if civilian populations are targeted by bombs from Gaza, Israel will do the same (it is \naccused of such anyway). The population might finally rethink and take responsibility for its privilege of \nvoting its leaders. As stated earlier, all behavior is instructive and when we mirror we teach the other the \neffects of his behavior. \nConversely, some situations demand that we assert asymmetry; those cases where it is necessary to highlight \nour differences with the enemy. Just this week, an disingenuous report was issued by an NGO drawing an \nequivalence between Palestinian and Israe li schoolbooks claiming that both sides have their relativistic\" \nnarratives.\" Yet, as the Palestinian Media Watch's website has demonstrated for years, there is nothing in the \nWest anywhere comparable to the hatred spewed daily by the Palestinian Authority, including through its \neducation system. It is interesting to note that while the US State Department initially funded the \"study,\"- in \nwhat appears to be an attempt to sanitize the PA's record so that the US can continue to fund the PA against \nthe spirit of US law- Hillary Clinton has a difficult time escaping her conclusion as Senator in 2007 that these \nschoolbooks along with other media \"profoundly poison(s) the minds of these children.\" It is most important \nthat we do not succumb to this type of use of symmetry that distorts the profound differences between us and \nthe enemy. \nEssentially, we are not clear as a nation, participating in a world with international rules, how to bes t fight \nthis enemy. The first act of any rehab is to acknowledge that we do not know how nor are we yet competent to \nstop our addictions. This is not a book about policy. In fact, the \"right\" policies are unlikely to emerge until a \ncritical mass has meaningfully dealt with their Control Factors and share a common perspective. We like to \nlook at our history and assume a single perspective throughout but the truth is that we had to learn how to \nrespond to Pearl Harbor, the Nazis, the Cold War etc. The same applies here. Our press promotes \"elites\" who \nare tasked with acting as if they possess the \"true wisdom\" to deal with our threats but the truth is we do not \nknow nor are we equipped to marshal enough of our population to agree just yet. The sooner we learn, \nhowever, the less we will suffer. Mirroring has always been a key component of those lessons. \nI have been encouraged by some recent acts that have begu n to nip at the asymmetry. For years, the language \nof \"feeling s\" had been reserved for our enemy while we were limited to that of \"action;\" we would do \nterrible acts that would cause bad feelings in the enemy which would then serve to justify whatever response \nit made. It had always been a question of the harsh insensitive acts Westerners do against Muslims and the \nresulting hurt, loss, shame etc. that Muslims experience. The Ground Zero Mosque incident, however, broke \nnew ground because all of a sudden non-Muslims' feelings became the focus and were cast as resulting from \nMuslim acts. Another example was seen in how quickly the attempt to blame the Benghazi murders on \nthe video about Mohammad fell apart. Just as large corporations eventually learned to turn away from \nshakedown attempts from race baiters, we are beginning to learn to demand symmetry through mirroring. A \nword of caution: When enablers change their behavior and demand symmetrical rules for the addict, the latter \ntypically initially erupts with great resistance. This is a stage we must be prepared to tolerate and fully \nwithstand as it creates the only real chance for the addict to finally change. It is critical, therefore, that when \nwe finally engage in mirroring that we be prepared to see it through completion. \nFP: What if we fail to engage in our own Inner Jihad and the Control Factor stays firmly in place? \nSiegel: Critical to the Inner Jihad is the realization that our civilization is fragile; not to be taken for granted. \nOur demands for multi-culturalism and diversity have bumped heads with the simple paradox that tolerating \nthe intolerant leads to extinction. Tolerating the intolerant is perhaps the most crystalline version of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024414 \nasymmetry we have accepted. Seriously engaged Muslims MUST place the Koran above all law while in \nAmerica, the Constitution ranks supreme. As Omar Ahmad, founder of CAIR, reputedly said, \"Islam isn't in \nAmer ica to be equal to any other faith, but to become dominant. The Koran is the highest authority in \nAmerica and Islam is the only accepted religion on Earth.\" Who makes law- the people or Allah? While the \nControl Factor constantly seeks for some accommodation between the two, this conflict CAN NOT be \nnegotiated. Only one can survive not because we have declared \"war\" but because our Islamic Enemy has. \nThat is, perhaps, the lesson we will most need to fully learn, one way or another. We will eventually hit a \nTurnaround Moment as a nation and if enough of us are not truly prepared to fight and continue to be \ncontrolled by our delusions, we will lose. If we truly seek to win, it is better to get there sooner while we have \nadvantages than later. \nFP: Bill Siegel, thank you for joining FrontPage Interview. \nAnd thank you for writing this superb and most important book. \nWe encourage all o four readers to get their hands on The Control Factor: Our Struggle to See the True  \nThreat and to read it! \nEditor's note: To watch The Glazov Gang's recent discussion about the Muslim Brotherhood's \ninfiltration of the United States and the Obama administration, see this week's episode below: \nFreedom Center pamphlets now available on Kindle: Click here. \nFiled Under: Daily Mailer, FrontPage Tagged With: Denial, Islam, muslim brotherhood, Obama, Siegel, The  \nControl Factor  \n22 \na Print This Post  \nAbout Jamie Glazov  \nJamie Glazov is Frontpage Magazine's editor.

The PLO had regained its uncontested leadership,\nand the Palestinian Authority received a massive financial boost with the influx of\ndonor money from across the world. Israel received a moral boost as a large number of\ncountries formally recognized its existence and established diplomatic relations.\n\nA hallmark of the Declaration of Principles was the establishment of a gradual\napproach to resolving the conflict. Gradualism now became the keyword for describing\nthe peace process. By breaking the overall goal of peace into manageable sections that\ncould be addressed in sequence, the Oslo process allowed for progress to be made and\ntrust to develop on less contentious issues before tackling more controversial topics like\nJerusalem, borders, security arrangements, and refugees, which could threaten to derail\nany talks.\n\nOne of the principal advantages of the step-by-step or gradualist approach was that\nit enabled the parties to reach compromises through ongoing dialogue and interaction\nwith each other by starting with the easiest issues and leaving the hardest for last. It\nallowed for an incremental change in perceptions and political positions. Although\ngradualism allowed success to be achieved in a variety of areas, moving the process\nforward, at each stage, depended on the parties taking the bold steps necessary to fulfill\ntheir respective commitments. The main weakness was slow movement in implemen-\ntation, with progress falling behind agreed upon timelines. This led to periodic\ndisillusionment and back-sliding.\n\nA recurrent problem was that the parties had failed to agree on a mechanism to\npenalize non-compliance. This critical deficiency undermined progress. As leaders and\nthe political climate changed, so too did the resolve to implement.\n\nSuccessful gradualism required the use of ambiguous language on the most conten-\ntious issues: Jerusalem, borders, security, and refugees. The successive Israeli govern-\nments and the Palestinian leadership had substantially different views on the final\nstatus of all four of these issues. The language contained within the Oslo documents, as\nwell as subsequent agreements, provides room for interpretation. Either side could\nclaim that the text represents their interests. This allowed leaders to go home to their\nrespective constituents and retain popular support.\n\nAnother practice that proved effective was the use of the annexes attached to agree-\nments to flesh out disruptive details, or to substantially water down the impact of\ncertain commitments made within the body of the text. In many cases the annexes are\nexhaustively long and detailed but are rarely read by the public, affording the leaders\npolitical space to make agreements that might otherwise face public criticism.\n\nThe three Israeli Prime Ministers who were in office from 1993 to 1999—Rabin,\nPeres, and Netanyahu—approached the challenges of peace through a concept of\ngradualism, postponing the tricky final status issues. Barak, who took office in 1999,\nwas the first Israeli Prime Minister to address the final status head-on with a “totalist”\napproach (read below).\n\nWhile the Oslo process was based on the concept of gradualism, characterized by\nbilateral negotiations—facilitated by a third party—and cumulative small steps dem-\nonstrating good faith, Ariel Sharon eventually took a contrary approach through\n“uncompromising unilateralism”. The day after he won the election in February 2001,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023164\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Net of distortions and seasonal\nadjustments, it looks like payroll growth is running at 150-175k per month, and GDP growth is running at a 2.25% trend\npace, both below prior recoveries. While 2.25% is a barn-burner compared to Europe, it only corresponds to a modest\nimprovement in employment. That’s why 2013 US fiscal policy is so important: this is not a recovery that can\nwithstand much tighter fiscal conditions.\n\nSo, how tight is US fiscal policy supposed to get next year?\n\nVery, if you look at what is supposed to happen according to current law. In the chart, we show the annual change in the\nbudget deficit over the last 25 years. The impact of all provisions scheduled to expire and kick in during 2013 would be\nvery large. But if Congress and the President elect to extend current tax rates, retain lower payroll tax rates and extended\njobless benefits, etc, the adjustment would not be as big, and only reflect expiration of Recovery Act provisions, the\nrecently passed Budget Control Act, and some other smaller provisions. There are of course plenty of permutations in\nbetween.\n\nWide range of outcomes for 2013 austerity Policies set to expire or take | Fiscal Drag (%\nChange in cyclically-adjusted federal deficit, % of potential GDP effect under current law of 2013 PGDP)\n\n] Sequester Automatic Cuts\n\n5 4 9,\n44 = — (Discretionary Spending) 0.4%\n34 Sequester Automatic Cuts\n2013 3 0.1%\n27 scenario (Mandatory Spending)\n14 estimates Bush Tax Cuts ($250k+ ;\n| 0.3%\n0 ncomes, Estate Tax)\n14 l Congress Bush Tax Cuts (Middle Income) 0.9%\n-2 4 | punts Alternative Minimum Tax 0.8%\n2] Payroll Tax Cut 0.6%\n= Current yU | t\n4 .Fiscaldrag law Pllecamkett nemploy men 0.2%\n1963 1968 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 2013 mpensation\nSource: CBO, IMF, Goldman Sachs, J.P.

Ifso, Congress can point to a March\n2012 paper by Summers and DeLong as justification. The bottom line from the paper: don’t tighten fiscal policy when\ninterest rates are near zero. The authors assert that (a) additional government spending can ease the long-term budget\nconstraint in conditions similar to today’s, and (b) tightening policy now would risk permanent loss of human capital,\nlower labor productivity growth and lower trend growth. They have held these views for a while; the paper appears\ndesigned to convince others.\n\nAdvocates for more fiscal and monetary stimulus often point to the charts below. Rising Federal debt has not resulted in\nhigher interest rates, so why not keep borrowing more?

Having switched its policy target from\nquantity to interest rates at its September Monetary Policy Meeting, it tacitly\nacknowledged that negative rates and JGB purchases were potentially approaching their\nlimit in terms of policy effectiveness. Inflation expectations fell and the yen\nstrengthened as a consequence as the market got accustomed to fading dovish\npronouncements from the Bank of Japan. Bo) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda himself said\n“Central banks are, admittedly, not omnipotent.\"\n\nThe Bo) introduced yield curve control, taking into consideration negative effects of\ngreat decline in yields and curve flattening on financial institution earnings or financial\nmarkets. If the Bo) keeps purchasing at the current rate, however, yields will sooner or\nlater feel downward pressure. We believe the Bo) is likely to reduce its long-term J)GB\npurchase gradually. For the time being, JGB yield guidelines are probably around 0% for\nthe 10yr, 0.4% for the 20yr, and 0.5% for the 30yr JGB.\n\nHowever, the Bo) appears to be concerned about the deterioration of financial\ninstitution earnings caused by flattening of the yield curve. Kuroda said that even if\nsuperlong-term yields rose slightly, he did not believe they would have to be lowered. He\nwent on to say he was also giving consideration to investors in superlong-term bonds,\nand that he did not think it was good for the yield curve to get continually flatter. Based\non these and other remarks, we expect long-term JGB purchase operations to be\nreduced and the curve to gradually steepen (Rates forecast: Attention on Bo) operations\n\nwhen yields decline).\n\nBefore that can happen, however, preconditions most likely include steady progress in\nUS rate hikes, avoidance of excessive yen appreciation, and some degree of recovery in\nthe inflation rate. With a Republican clean sweep, US fiscal easing is now a foregone\nconclusion and “Higher rates and higher dollar” may support our view for yen rates. If\nJGB purchase operations were reduced and yen rates rose in the wake of higher US\nTreasury yields and USD/JPY appreciation, that could easily be explained by\nfundamentals.\n\nYen rates volatility is still low; however, purchasing cuts by the Bo) could add to\nvolatility risk amid declining liquidity in the super long-end (Chart 78). Even if risk-off\nsentiment pushes down the yield curve, the Bo) may lower the 10yr JGB yield target\nfrom zero to keep the curve steep. This kind of policy change also could increase\nvolatility. In either case, the 10yr is expected to be anchored and movement is expected\nin the long end. We believe 1y10s20s conditional bear steepener may mitigate this risk.\n\nTrade recommendation: Long S5bn 1y20y @0.62% (atm+11bp) payer vs Short 9.9bn\n1y10y @0.18% (atm) payer.

He spells out in great detail how various particular cognitive functions may be\nachieved via agents and their interactions. He leaves no room for any central algorithms or\nstructures of thought, famously arguing: “What magical trick makes us intelligent? The trick\nis that there is no trick. The power of intelligence stems from our vast diversity, not from any\nsingle, perfect principle.”\n\nThis perspective was extended in the more recent work The Emotion Machine [Min07], where\nMinsky argued that emotions are “ways to think” evolved to handle different “problem types”\nthat exist in the world. The brain is posited to have rule-based mechanisms (selectors) that\nturns on emotions to deal with various problems.\n\nOverall, both of these works serve better as works of speculative cognitive science than as\nworks of AI or cognitive architecture per se. As neurologist Richard Restak said in his review\nof Emotion Machine, “Minsky does a marvelous job parsing other complicated mental activities\ninto simpler elements. ... But he is less effective in relating these emotional functions to what’s\ngoing on in the brain.” As Restak added, he is also not so effective at relating these emotional\nfunctions to straightforwardly implementable algorithms or data structures.\n\nPush Singh, in his PhD thesis and followup work [SBC05], did the best job so far of creating\na concrete AI design based on Minsky’s ideas. While Singh’s system was certainly interesting,\nit was also noteworthy for its lack of any learning mechanisms, and its exclusive focus on\nexplicit rather than implicit knowledge. Due to Singh’s tragic death, his work was never brought\nanywhere near completion. It seems fair to say that there has not yet been a serious cognitive\narchitecture posed based closely on Minsky’s ideas.\n\n4.5.3 DUAL\n\nThe closest thing to a Minsky-ish cognitive architecture is probably DUAL, which takes the\nSociety of Mind concept and adds to it a number of other interesting ideas. DUAL integrates\nsymbolic and connectionist approaches at a deeper level than CLARION, and has been used\nto model various cognitive functions such as perception, analogy and judgment. Computations\nin DUAL emerge from the self-organized interaction of many micro-agents, each of which is\na hybrid symbolic/connectionist device. Each DUAL agent plays the role of a neural network\nnode, with an activation level and activation spreading dynamics; but also plays the role of\na symbol, manipulated using formal rules. The agents exchange messages and activation via\nlinks that can be learned and modified, and they form coalitions which collectively represent\nconcepts, episodes, and facts.\n\nThe structure of the model is sketchily depicted in Figure 4.10, which covers the application\nof DUAL to a toy environment called TextWorld. The visual input corresponding to a stim-\nulus is presented on a two-dimensional visual array representing the front end of the system.\nPerceptual primitives like blobs and terminations are immediately generated by cheap parallel\ncomputations. Attention is controlled at each time by an object which allocates it selectively\nto some area of the stimulus. A detailed symbolic representation is constructed for this area\nwhich tends to fade away as attention is withdrawn from it and allocated to another one.

The private healthcare sector has some role to play; the National\nTransformation Plan (NTP) targets the private sector to be responsible for funding 35%\nof healthcare spend in 2020, up from 25% today. How it intends to do this is uncertain.\nWe believe the incumbent private hospital operators, including listed companies (Al\nHammadi, Care, Dallah, MEAHCO and Mouwasat) should be beneficiaries of increased\nprivate sector funding, although increased investment would be needed to meet growth\nin demand longer-term.\n\nImprove public facilities, work towards privatisation\n\nThe government wants to step back from financing and providing healthcare and adopt\nan oversight and regulatory role. Firstly the government wants to improve the quality of\ncare offered in the public sector, with the eventual aim of working towards privatisation\nof public assets and healthcare provision. This implies no privatisations short-term.\n\nNear-term: Management contracts for public hospitals\n\nIn the near-term the government could seek to improve healthcare provision in the\npublic system by using private sector expertise, through, e.g. contracting management\nof public facilities to the private sector. Individual such contracts are unlikely to\ntransform company earnings, and the small size of existing Saudi hospital groups limits\nthe depth of management available to capture large contracts, in our view.\n\nLong-term: insurance coverage up to 31m from 10.5m\n\nIn the long-term a widespread adoption of private health insurance is likely to raise\nvolumes, spurring an increase in private healthcare capacity, either from organic\ninvestment or participation in privatisations. In Saudi currently, 10.5m/31m people have\ninsurance. We assume a more universal scheme would offer lower pricing than that\ntoday, and listed incumbents would need to make a cultural shift towards addressing\nthis market. Such a market could attract new competitors, domestic or foreign.\n\nType of insurance system and reimbursement uncertain\n\nWe believe reimbursement levels would need to be known before privatisations can\noccur so bidders can budget and estimate their return on capital. It is still uncertain\nwhether the government would seek to introduce insurance through the incumbent\nprivate operators (Bupa Arabia, Medgulf and Tawuniya) or set up its own insurance\ncompany e.g. an Abu Dhabi-style Daman. Nor whether it would subsidise premiums or\nsimply force the private sector to employ more Saudis.\n\nGovernment needs to improve private sector relations\n\nAt present the government has not paid private hospitals for the treatment of public\npatients referred to them for over a year. Until the relationship improves, engaging with\nthe private sector could be difficult.\n\nHealthcare implications of National Transformation Plan\n\nThe Saudi government’s Vision 2030 document calls for an improvement in healthcare\nin Saudi Arabia. The private healthcare sector is likely to be a beneficiary both in the\nshort-term and long-term. In the short-term the National Transformation Plan (NTP)\ntargets the private sector to be responsible for funding 35% of healthcare spend in\n2020, up from 25% today. In the longer-term, the Saudi government wants to remove\nitself from directly providing and financing healthcare, instead focussing on public\nhealth and the regulation of the healthcare sector. Raising private sector funding\nthresholds to 35% appears possible if a number of measures are used, e.g. more\nrigorous enforcement of requirement that Saudis working in private sector hold\ninsurance could increase penetration by 6% alone. The quality targets set for the public\nsector do not appear unduly onerous in theory, but execution remains key.\n\nOS Merrill Lynch GEMs Paper #26|30June 2016 51\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016161\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Gulf states will no doubt judge that\nif the United States was unable and\nunwilling to attack Tehran under these\ncircumstances, then it is certainly not\ngoing to attack Iran in the future, when it\nwill be able to retaliate with nuclear\nweapons.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029808\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The first stirrings of discontent had begun even before I went to see\nClinton. On the basis of my commitment merely to try for peace, Arik Sharon had\npresented a no-confidence motion in the Knesset. It was never going to pass. But\nonly days after I’d made him Interior Minister, Natan Sharansky let it be known he\nwas going to vote against us. He didn’t. He stayed away from the chamber, in\neffect abstaining. But I’d been put on notice.\n\nI did lose my first coalition partner in September: the small United Torah\nJudaism party, with five Knesset seats. It wasn’t over land-for-peace. In an echo of\na similar crisis that brought down the government during Rabin’s first spell as\nPrime Minister in the 1970s, it was over a violation of the Jewish Sabbath. It\nturned out that Israel’s state electric company had been transporting a huge steam-\ncondensation machine from the manufacturing site near Haifa to a power plant in\nAshdod. The unit was the size of a small apartment. It weighed 100 tons. It\ncouldn’t be driven across the country without bringing weekday traffic to a\nstandstill. The obvious solution was to do it when road use was lightest, on\nShabbat. Precisely the same procedure had been followed — 24 times — under Bibi.\nBut when I asked a United Torah Judaism leader why he’d seemed happy when\nLikud had waved it through, he replied: “Past sins cannot pardon future ones.” Eli\nSuissa, one of the Shas ministers in the cabinet, took his side, saying: “Every hour\nis good for the keeping of Shabbat.” Most other ministers agreed with me that we\nshould stand firm. So I did. But UTJ walked out of the government. Shas did\nremain. But I was now increasingly certain that at some stage its ministers, too,\nwould leave.\n\nIn the midst of the Sharanksy rebellion, Haim Ramon, who was the minister in\ncharge of liaising with the Knesset, insisted I “punish” him for his political\ngrandstanding. “You should fire Sharansky. Act like a leader!” I just laughed. ‘““The\ncoalition doesn’t need a leader,” I replied. “It needs therapy.” In truth, I suspected\nthat if we ever got near to a peace agreement with Assad or Arafat, even therapy\nmight not help. But that was a main reason that I’d promised a referendum on any\nfinal peace deals. I believed that in the choice between concessions, even painful\nones, and a genuine peace deal with Syria or the Palestinians, by far most Israelis\nwould choose peace.\n\nI relied on a strong, close team around me, people I knew well and who shared\nmy determination to stay focused on the central goal: to put Israel in a position\nwhere its citizens could be given that choice.

He has\nso far settled a dozen.\n\nThese same civil complaints allege that young girls from South America, Europe, and the former\nSoviet republics, few of whom spoke English, were recruited for Esptein's sexual pleasure.\nAccording to a former bookkeeper, a number of the girls worked for MC2, the modeling agency\nowned by Jean Luc Brunel, a longtime acquaintance and frequent guest of Epstein's.\n\nBrunel, along with numerous young models, was a frequent passenger on Epstein's private jet,\naccording to flight manifests. The agency owner also allegedly received $1 million from Epstein\nin 2005, when he founded MC2 with his partner, Jeffrey Fuller; although Fuller and Brunel\ndenied any such payment from the billionaire pervert in 2007, when rumors started swirling,\nSamoff got confirmation from a former bookkeeper at the agency. Whether the money was a\nsecret investment in MC2, or a payment for Brunel's services as a procurer, is unknown. Brunel\n\nalso visited Epstein in jail.\n\nSo who is Jean Luc Brunel? Although he did not respond to our interview request, we spoke to a\nnumber of people who have worked with his agency. While MC2 isn't considered a major\nindustry player, it isn't exactly bottom-shelf, either: MC2 in New York most recently launched\nthe career of Latvian editorial star Ginta Lapina (Brunel \"discovered\" Lapina via an MC2\nscouting competition for young teens) and currently represents Vogue China covergirl Liu Dan.\nWorldwide, MC2 represents such stars as Sessilee Lopez in Miami, and top models Candace\n\nSwanepoel, Marina Lynchuk, Natalia Chabanenko, and Elisa Sednaoui in Tel Aviv.\n\nBrunel isn't involved with the business on a day-to-day basis, although he owns an 85% stake in\nMC2. Instead, \"Right now he does scouting for [the] agency and takes care of the international\nrelations with other agencies,” reports one source. Scouts scour the world for un-agented\nteenaged girls who could make it as models; they work largely unsupervised and are generally\npaid a headhunting fee for every girl an agency signs. Even when affiliated with an agency, as\nBrunel obviously is with MC2, scouts operate mostly independently and with little oversight —\neven relative to the almost totally unregulated modeling industry itself. \"He travels a lot,\" says\nanother person who has worked with Brunel. (The company blog refers to Brunel as a \"scouting\ntsunami,\" and MC2 is fairly well-known for the strength of its international scouting.)\n\nModels we spoke to report mostly positive experiences with Brunel — one praised his sense of\nhumor and said he is “lovely to all of his models,\" and another described him as highly\nintelligent and cultured, adding, \"he knows a lot about the opera and he paints\" — although it\nshould be noted that none of the models whom we spoke to had been told of either his\nconnections with Epstein, or his past.\n\nAnd what a past it is. These accounts from Michael Gross' 1995 book Model describe Brunel's\nactivities in Paris from the late 1970s onwards, when he worked for, and eventually owned, the\n\nmodeling agency Karins, now known as Karin Paris:\n\n“Jean-Luc is considered a danger,\" says Jér6me Bonnouvrier. \"Owning Karins was a dream for a\nplayboy.

It is inconceivable that Kislyak did not\nknow that the call would be monitored by the FBI, since the FBI had routinely listened in on these\nlines for the past 68 years, or that his discussion of Kushner’s request would set off alarm bells in\nthe intelligence community.\n\nIf Kislyak had wanted to hide this exchange from U.S. intelligence, he could have easily sent it\nunder diplomatic cover directly to Moscow, used a secure line, or relayed it in a coded fashion. By\ncommunicating the message en clair, or in plaintext, Kislyak skillfully exposed Kushner’s\nincredibly stupid response, which he himself had provoked, to stoke distrust about the incoming\npresident within the U.S. intelligence community. Nor was this the only mistrust Kislyak\ncultivated: the conversations on the monitored phone led to the firing of National Security Advisor\nMichael Flynn, and conversations that Kislyak had with Attorney General Jeff Sessions led to\nSessions’s recusing himself from the Russian investigation, which has now driven a wedge between\nPresident Trump and one of his most effective and popular cabinet members.\n\nKislyak’s resume indicates that he is a well-regarded and competent player in the game of nations:\nhe has served as Second Secretary of the Soviet UN mission in New York, First Secretary of the\nSoviet Embassy in Washington, Deputy Director of the Soviet Department of International\nOrganizations in Moscow, Permanent Russian representative to NATO in Brussels, Deputy Foreign\nMinister, and Ambassador to the United States. Nothing in his 37-year career, either during or after\nthe Cold War, suggests that his moves are not aligned with Kremlin strategy.\n\nBut when it comes to the various disclosures and interventions surrounding the 2016 election, what\nexactly was that strategy?\n\nIn a report issued on January 6, 2017, entitled “Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in\nRecent U.S. Elections,” the U.S. intelligence community concluded, based both on its sources and\nits analysis of stories on the Russian-controlled network RT, that Putin wanted to hurt Clinton, help\nTrump, and discredit the American election. These may well have been motives of the Russian\npresident, but the narrowly focused assessment fails to explain, or even take into account, Kislyak’s\npost-election ensnarement of Kushner, or the discrediting dirt against Trump. If Putin had really\nwanted to help Trump win the election, why did Russian sources provide damaging dirt to Steele,\nwhich could have cost Trump the election? Why did Kislyak provide the FBI with information, via\na known tapped line, that could (and did) compromise key members of Trump’s administration?\n\nA wider focus can be found, of all places, in Oliver Stone’s revealing, if fawning, four-hour\ninterview with Putin, in which the Russian dictator makes clear that he views American hegemony,\nincluding America’s standing and respect in the international community, as a threat that Russia\nmust counter. One way to undermine America’s standing is to provide disclosures that can be used\nby its own political factions, and the media, to sow distrust in America’s reliability as a democracy\nfounded on transparency. Putin tells the truth when he says that it doesn’t matter particularly to\nRussia whether Clinton or Trump won the election: his goal was to install doubt in the legitimacy\nof the process, regardless of how it turned out.\n\nEdward Jay Epstein’s most recent book is How America Lost Its Secrets: Edward\nSnowden, the Man and the Theft, published by Alfred A.

This is not a legislative, binding resolution; the European\nCommission will need to consider a regulatory framework that permits access and\navailability to cannabis medicine, therapies and scientific studies.\n\nThe European Parliament explicitly stated support for the WHO's recommendations to\ninstitutionalize the medical and scientific uses of cannabis. Having these two\ninternational institutions aligned on standardizing medical cannabis policies will\nfacilitate support for interstate agreements and trade, and paves way for rapid\nlegislative change and growth.\n\nEU Standards And Regulations\n\nThere is not a supranational regulatory framework for cannabis in the EU. However,\ngeneral standards, such as Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), Good Agricultural and\nCollection Practice and Good Distribution Practice, are now significant for cannabis\ncompliance. Licenses and authorization must be obtained for certification. This is\nespecially required for pharmaceutical grade cannabis, which is why many Canadian LPs\ncan export to Europe and made investments to build GMP-certified facilities. Although\nnot necessary for non-prescribed cannabis, products with GMP-certification have\ntrusted quality recognition across the EU.\n\nIn the EU, the legal limit for THC content is less than 0.2%, in comparison to North\nAmerica where it is less than 0.3% THC. There are some disparities across the continent\nwith higher margins in Italy (up to 0.6%) and various import requirements country to\ncountry. Outside of the EU, Switzerland permits up to 1% THC content, which is treated\nas a tobacco substitute.\n\nEU Novel Food\n\nRecently, CBD has been added to the European Union's (EU) Novel Food Catalogue.\nFoodstuff may be supplements, ingredients or other substance forms. A “novel” food is a\nproduct not previously consumed in the EU, to a significant degree, prior to May 15,\n1997, such as for example, foods that enter the market through new technology or\nagricultural products normally consumed and grown outside of the EU (e.g. chia seeds,\nvitamin K, UV treated food).\n\nAmendments to the Catalogue occur frequently and provide a regulatory framework for\nEU Member States (MS) to follow. Some MS (i.e. UK, France, Germany, Italy, and\nHolland) requested to update the catalogue with CBD and hemp-derived products. The\nEuropean Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is now conducting a risk assessment for CBD.\nThis categorization includes pure CBD extracts and products that contain CBD extracts.\nThe EFSA’s assessment is limited to a daily intake of 130 milligrams. The outcome of the\nreview is expected in March 2019. By October 2019, the European Commission will\nrelease a draft act to authorize CBD in the updated Catalogue.\n\nWhile the EFSA assesses CBD, some countries have already banned the sale of CBD and\nremoved product from the shelves (e.g. France, Austria). MS may have their national\nfood or health agencies provide further guidance for CBD products and preparations.\nObtaining authorization for CBD and hemp-derived products (e.g. tinctures, edibles,\n\nCOWEN.COM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024896\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

And lives, I\ninsisted, were at stake.

In fact, I announced that if Bibi did go ahead and finalize the terms for\nour Oslo redeployment, Labor would once again provide the extra Knesset votes\nneeded for him to get it approved.\n\nEarly in 1998, he sent word that he wanted to talk. The message came through\nYaakov Ne’eman, his Finance Minister and a prominent lawyer whom I knew and\nliked. He and I held an exploratory meeting at which he proposed talks with Bibi\non the prospect of a unity government that would help move the peace process\nforward. I said I’d talk, with one proviso: the discussions would be genuinely\nsecret, with no leaks. I was not prepared to engage in political gamesmanship. In\nMay, Bibi sent an assurance of confidentiality through Ne’eman. The first of about\na half-dozen meetings came a few days later at the Prime Minister’s residence in\nJerusalem. Then, we shifted venue, meeting at a Mossad-owned villa north of Tel\nAviv. I brought along Bougie Herzog, a bright young lawyer, and Labor Party\nmember, who was working in the same law firm and Ne’eman. It was by no means\nclear we’d agree on a unity government. To my amusement, if not altogether to my\nsurprise, I got word that Bibi was putting out separate political feelers to Shimon\nPeres. But before long, it became clear there was a specific political motivation\nbehind his approaching me. It was indeed the peace process.

It’s a dance of men and women and\nmachines and winches and elevators and lights. The wings of the St. James are very narrow, so when a giant\npiece of scenery disappears from the audience’s view, the most elaborate game of Tetris begins, as the\noutstanding stage crew turns and lifts and twists; not an inch is wasted.

LeCarre’s now classic\nmole, code-named by the KGB “Gerald,” managed in the novel to gain access to the inner\nsanctum of the British intelligence service MI-6. Aided and guided by his controllers in Moscow,\nhe systematically stole British intelligence secrets. As LeCarre wove the plot, the brilliantly-\norchestrated operation involved spotting, compromising, and recruiting others to gradually\nadvance Gerald the mole to a position of power. Such well-organized penetrations are not limited\nto fiction. The career of KGB mole Heinz Felfe, who was advanced through the ranks of\nGerman intelligence by an elaborate series of sacrifices by his controllers in Moscow until he\nactually headed German counterintelligence in 1961, could have served as the non-fiction\ninspiration for Le Carre’s 1963 novel Zhe Spy Who Came out of the Cold. As US intelligence\nonly found out after the Cold War ended, the KGB also had the ability to sustain moles for\ndecades.\n\nThe CIA also had its share of long term successes, such as Alexander Poteyev, who fed the CIA\nsecrets for over ten years while burrowing into Russian intelligence. In the choreography of\nthese operations, as in Le Carre’s fiction, rival intelligence services ensnared and sacrificed\nrecruits , as if playing a chess game, to advance their moles. Despite notable successes such as\nFelfe, and Poteyev, a great number of these elaborate conspiracies fail insinuate moles in their\nadversaries’ confidence. Intelligence services therefore also take advantage of a more prosaic\nsource: the self-generated spy, or, as they are called in the trade, walk-in.\n\nAlthough they are largely unsung in novels, these walk-ins are an important part of\nespionage. A counterespionage review done for the Presidential Foreign Intelligence Advisory\nBoard (PFIEB) in 1990 found that most US spies in the Cold War had taken documents on their\nown volition and only afterwards offered them to an adversary service. Self-generated spies have\ndiverse motives. Some intelligence workers steal secrets for financial gains. Others take them to\nfurther an ideological interest. As opportunistic enterprises, intelligence services do not turn walk-\nins away if they have valuable intelligence. Indeed, some of the most successful moles were not\nrecruited, or even controlled, by spy agencies. They were self-generated penetrations, or\n“sources” as the KGB preferred to call them, who first stole secrets and later voluntarily deliver\nthem to an adversary.

I have not only observed and\nwritten about these changes, I have helped to bring some of them about through my litigation, my\nwriting and my teaching. This book presents an account of these changes and of my participation\nin the cases that precipitated them. It is also an account of one man’s intellectual and ideological\ndevelopment during a dramatic century of world, American, and Jewish history, enriched with\nanecdotes and behind-the-scenes stories from my life and the lives of those I have encountered.\n\nAn autobiographer is like a defendant who takes the stand at his own trial. We all have the right\nto remain silent, both in life and in law. But if one elects to bear witness about his own life, then\nhe or she must tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. This commitment to\ncomplete candor is subject only to limited privileges such as those between a lawyer and a client,\nor a husband and a wife. A witness may be questioned not only about his actions, but also about\nhis motivations, his feelings, his biases, and his regrets. In this autobiography, I intend to comply\nwith these rules to the best of my ability.\n\nWhy then have I waived my privilege of silence and decided to write this autobiography: because\nI have lived the passion of my times and participated in some of the most transforming, legal and\npolitical events of the past half century. In this autobiography, I will describe and explain my role\nin litigating cases and advocating causes that have changed the political and legal landscape—for\nbetter or worse. I will also explain how I litigate difficult cases—the tactics and strategies I have\nsuccessfully developed over the years. My oath of honesty makes it impossible to hide behind the\nfalse modesty that often denies the readers of autobiographies an accurate picture of the impact an\nauthor has had on events.\n\nSince you’re reading these words, you’ve probably encountered the public Alan\nDershowitz—confrontational, unapologetic, brash, tough, argumentative, and uncompromising.\nThose who know me well—family, friends, and colleagues—hardly recognize the “character” I\nplay on TV [alternative: my TV persona]. They tell me in my personal life, I shy away from\nconfrontation and am something of a pushover. My son Elon says that when people bring me up\nin conversation, he can instantly tell whether they know me from TV or from personal\ninteractions—whether they know what he calls “The Dersh Character” or “the real Alan.”\n\nThis sharp dichotomy between my public and private personas was brought home to me quite\ndramatically, when a major motion picture, Reversal of Fortune, was made about my role in the\nClaus Von Bulow case, and a character, based on me, was played by Tony Award actor Ron\nSilver. The New York Times asked me to write an article for the arts and entertainment section\non how it feels to watch someone play you on the big screen.\n\nThe opening scene of the film had my character playing an energetic basketball game with\nhimself—true enough. But when he’s interrupted by a phone call giving him the news that he had\nlost a case involving two brothers on death row (the Tison brothers, see Chapter 12), he smashes\nthe phone on the pavement.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017092\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Each\ntumor constitutes its own world of defective genes and\nproteins. By studying the genetic quirks of exception-\nal responders, physicians can systematically identify\nweaknesses in cancer subtypes and blast them with\ndrugs that target their unique vulnerabilities. “It’s a\ntestament to how much has been learned about the\ngenome in the past 30 years,” Solit says. “We’ ve always\nwanted to find out why some individuals respond so\nwell. Now we have the capacity. It’s going to really\nchange the way we treat patients.”\n\nUNLIKELY CASES HAVE AN eminent history in medi-\ncine. The modern science of the mind owes a lot to\n\nthe freakish accident suffered by Phineas Gage, a\n\n19th century railroad construction foreman whose\n\njob involved packing down explosive powder with a\n\nthree-and-a-half-foot-long iron tamping rod. On Sept.\n13, 1848, the powder exploded in his face, blasting the\nrod up through his chin and out the back of his head.\nAgainst all odds, he survived. But his personality was\ntransformed. The formerly shrewd and patient Gage\n\nbecame obnoxious and unreliable.\n\nAn observant doctor named John Martyn Harlow\nwho cared for Gage proposed that his personality\nchange was due to the destruction of the frontal lobe\nof the left side of the brain. Gage’s unlikely transfor-\nmation revealed a universal truth about brains, that\nparticular parts—the frontal lobes—are required for\nself-control. The strange case of Phineas Gage is still\nmentioned in neuroscience textbooks.\n\nRare events can also lead to new cures. As the story\ngoes, English physician Edward Jenner’s observations\nof an 18th century milkmaid who caught cowpox and\nthereby became immune to smallpox paved the way for\nthe fi vaccines. New ideas for curing HIV are emerg-\ning from the famously unlucky lucky case of the “Berlin\npatient.” Timothy Ray Brown, who was HIV positive,\ndeveloped blood cancer leukemia in 2006. His chemo-\ntherapy and radiation treatments wiped out the cells\nof his immune system, where the virus is believed to\nhide. He then got a bone marrow transplant from one\nof those rare people with a gene mutation that makes\nthem resistant to HIV. Today, Brown still has no sign\n\n37\n\nof HIV in his body, and his case has inspired a study\nto genetically engineer HIV-positive patients’ cells to\nresist the virus.\n\nIn the past, cancer researchers weren’t able to\ncapitalize on their unexpected outlier successes. Not\nenough was known about the biology of cancer, and\nthe right tools hadn’t been invented. “Even if someone\nhad a complete remission, you had no way to figure out\nwhy,” says James Doroshow, director of the Division of\nCancer Treatment and Diagnosis of the National Can-\ncer Institute (NCI). That changed in the 2000s, when\nit became possible to analyze the genetics of cancer\ntumors for clues.\n\nThe first major success came with studies of the\ndrug gefitinib in non-small-cell lung cancer (the most\ncommon kind). Gefitinib helped less than 20 percent\nof the people who took it, but a few outliers had dra-\nmatic, rapid recoveries. In 2004, two Harvard groups\nfound that the responders had mutations in the epi-\ndermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. EGFR 1s\none of many genes that regulates how cells grow and\nwhen they die, and the mutation basically forced it to\npump out two or three times as much growth signal as\nit should, fueling the cancer. Gefitinib dialed down the\nsignal. A clinical trial later proved that the drug keeps\ntumors at bay for more than nine months in people\nwith certain EGFR mutations.\n\nMore insights gleaned from extraordinary respond-\ners soon followed. One melanoma patient in a study of\n22 people taking sorafenib saw his tumor shrink quick-\nly, a response due to a mutation in the gene KIT, which\nregulates cell growth, division and survival. People\nwith certain kinds of melanoma, such as the type that\ngrows on mucus membranes, now routinely get tested\nfor this mutation. The drug helps about 40 percent of\nthose with the mutation—an impressive advance in a\ncancer that once had no effective treatment.\n\nIn these studies, investigators had to make educat-\ned guesses about where in the genome to look for the\nculprit mutations. It was the keys-under-the-lamppost\nphenomenon: They could only examine genes they\nalready suspected were involved in the cancer. But as\nthe speed and efficiency of DNA sequencing skyrocket-\ned, and its price plummeted, it started to look reason-\nable to sequence the whole tumor genome to cast the\nwidest possible net.

As an adult, he created a robot to dance with: KUKA.\n\nTaiwanese dancer, choreographer, inventor, and videographer Huang Yi’s pioneering work is steeped in his fascination with the partnership\nbetween humans and robots. He interweaves continuous movement with mechanical and multimedia elements to create a form of dance\nwhich corresponds with the flow of data, effectively making the performer a dancing instrument. Named by Dance Magazine as one of the\n“25 to Watch,” Huang is one of Asia’s most prolific choreographers.\n\nHarmoniously weaving together the art of dance and the science of mechanical engineering, HUANG YI & KUKA is a poetic work that\nintertwines modern dance and visual arts with the realm of robotics, revealing humanity through a series of vignettes between live dancers\nand KUKA, a robot conceptualized and programmed by Huang. “Dancing face to face with a robot is like looking at my own face in a\nmirror...I think I have found the key to spin human emotions into robots,” Huang asserts.\n\nHUANG YI & KUKA is an original production of Huang Yi Studio +, developed at 3LD Art & Technology Center, in association with\nSozo Artists.

The challenges Jain explores are some of the biggest -- climate change, biotech, intelligent machines -- and her\nresulting work “navigates the entangled wilderness of our technology, politics, culture and environment to imagine new ways of seeing,\nbeing and acting.”\n\nIn her work, Jain creates worlds, stories and tools that provoke and inspire us to engage with the precarity of our rapidly changing world.\nSuperflux is building tools, methods and commons that can enable us to mitigate the shock of food insecurity and climate change. Recently\nthey produced a series of civilian drones, and created a vision of a near-future city where these intelligent machines begin to display\nincreasing autonomy with civic society.

He was\ncertainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few moments\nin his company and you know this to be true.\n\nWhen I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that\n“Andy”—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange\ntitle is. Because if one thing’s for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he’s talking\nabout far more than “Andy” does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other financiers hang out\nwith him.\n\nAnd Ghislaine?\nFull disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It’s almost impossible not to.\n\nShe is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I’ve spent hours\ntalking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious.\nShe has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of\nthe fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else’s I can think of—probably even Rupert Murdochs’.\nShe is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is\nclose friends.\n\nYet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-Platero,\n(Known fondly to her close friends as “the Tennis Goddess”) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes\ndown to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability.\n\nAnd that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey.\n\n“He saved her,” I remember a close friend of mine telling me. “When her father died, she was a wreck; inconsolable.\nAnd then Jeffrey took her in. She’s never forgotten that—and never will.”\n\nIn many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect replacement\nfor her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos, but\nthen Ghislaine’s father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving a massive “black hole” he’d\nfraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that strange.\n\nIn fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful people\nin the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and\nmoved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don’t tend to get to\nthe top by being the world’s most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn’t quite manage a\nnormal life—whatever that is. He had a second “wife” for many years whose existence he has been open about.\n\nSo what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven’t spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her\nloyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look at\nWaksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for all sorts\nof blemishes.\n\nDK OK KK OK KK KK OK KK OK OK OK KK OK KK OK OK OK OK OK KK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK KK 2K OK OK 2K OK 2K OK OK KOK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK KOK\n\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.

This redeployment\nwas Solow’s “disembodied growth.” But growth after that have to come from capital\nnew in kind.

And Mill was posing an even tougher one. The paragraph quoted\nis clearly describing capital acceleration. Capital as he describes it is not only\ninnovating consistently as it keeps up with consumption, but picking up the pace,\n\nand still taking the innovation costs in stride. Is that too much even for Achilles?\n\nIt is not. Charts and tables show that the kind of growth Mill describes has proved\nthe only kind in every country and period where tests are practical.

This is\nwhat clearly happens, or anyhow has happened so far, despite so many reasons to\n\nthink it is impossible. What would explain it?\n\nFirst take the lesser puzzle. Balanced growth, where capital, output and\nconsumption all grow at the same constant rate, must make do with depreciation\ninvestment.

The three exceptions were China, North Korea (via\nChina) and Russia.\n\nThe only one of these three countries, or any other country, that Snowden is known to have\ndealt with directly during his 33 day stay in Hong Kong, was Russia. As previously discussed, he\nhad dealings with Russian “diplomatic representatives “, as Putin called them. Putin did not\nprovide the date of these contacts but he provided an intriguing clue. Snowden was identified to\nhim, according to Putin, not by name but merely as an “agent of special services.” Putin’s\ndescription suggests the meeting had taken place before Snowden became a household name on\nJune 9, 2013.\n\nFor his part, Snowden was evasive when discussing his contacts with Russia while still in\nHong Kong. When Lana Lam asked Snowden on June 12, 2013 whether he had already\nrequested asylum from the Russia government, he deferred, saying: “My only comment is that I\nam glad there are governments that refuse to be intimidated by great power.” As it turned out,\nSnowden was correct. The Russian government was not intimidated by the threats of reprisals by\nthe United States, as the Obama Administration would learn after his arrival in Russia on June 23,\n2013. But the only way that Snowden could not have known that fact on June 12\" was by being\nin contact with Russian officials prior to his interview with Lam. Of course, he may have had\nmultiple contacts on different dates with these officials. The Russian pro-government\nnewspaper Kommersant reported that Snowden had visited the Russian consulate on more than\none occasion and had been given a birthday celebration there on June 21, 2013.\n\nWhat we do know about Snowden’s interactions with the Russians in Hong Kong comes partly\nfrom Putin’s own description of them. Putin said, it will be recalled, that his decision to facilitate\nSnowden’s escape to Russia had been kicked all the way up the Russian chain of command for\nhim to personally decide Snowden’s fate. Presumably, this decision-making process began earlier\nthan June 21, 2013, when he reportedly came to the consulate. The question is: how much\nearlier? Since Snowden had arrived in Hong Kong on May 20\", 2013, his contacts with Russian\nofficials could have occurred as long as a month earlier. That would fit in with Snowden telling\nGellman on May 24\" that he needed his help in dealing with the diplomatic mission of an unnamed\ncountry. In any case, Putin tells us he learned an American “agent of the special services” had\ncontacted Russian diplomats because he wanted assistance. And Snowden did need assistance to\nescape from Hong Kong. As he had no visas, he would require the sort of assistance that could\nonly be provided by a government willing to defy the United States. The assistance came from\nRussia.\n\nNine days before Snowden boarded Aeroflot flight SU213 to Moscow on June 23\", the US had\nfiled a criminal complaint against him. It had also alerted Hong Kong authorities and Interpol\nwhen it unsealed the complaint on June 21, 2013. And on June 21st it had invalidated his U.S.\npassport (although he still had it in his possession at the Hong Kong Airport.)

Bibi was beginning the negotiations\nto form a government, and that process was likely to take at least a few weeks.\nShimon had yet to signal whether he did intend to stay on. Still, when he invited\nme for a late-night chat at his apartment a week after the election, I was concerned\nhe might raise the leadership issue and I knew that, if he did, I would have to be\nhonest and open with him.\n\nThe conversation went very differently than I’d expected. After he’d poured\neach of us a glass of Armagnac, and offered me a plate of Sonia’s cakes, he spoke\nfor a while about Bibi, though he could not even bring himself to utter the name.\nThis man, he said, knew nothing about leadership, much less about running the\ncountry. He would be outmaneuvered, overshadowed and ultimately controlled by\nthe “real strongman” in the Likud: Arik Sharon. I said I thought we were again\nunderestimating Bibi’s strength, as well as the effect of the country’s new electoral\nsystem. He was the first Prime Minister to enjoy a direct, personal mandate. That\nturned upside down the balance of power and influence in our politics. As he\nassembled his coalition, the other parties, if they wanted to be in government,\nwould have to deal with him on his terms. So, to a much greater extent than before,\nwould potential internal rivals.\n\nAs we talked, I was struck that Shimon seemed resigned to the election defeat,\nrelaxed, more at ease with himself than at any time since the start of the grueling\ncampaign. Then, quite suddenly, he said: “Ehud, I understand the meaning of the\nelection result. “You will have to take on the leadership, and lead the party.” He\nsaid he didn’t plan to spend the rest of his years hanging around the apartment. He\nwould remain active — “working for peace” — but no longer in the party political\narena. “I understand the meaning of what has happened,” he repeated. “I will pass\nthe Labor leadership torch to you. We should find a way to do it quickly, and in the\nright way.”\n\nIt was nearly three in the morning when I left. I was not just surprised, but\ntouched, by what he’d said. Shimon was now nearly 73. He’d had a life in our\ncountry’s politics, and in Labor, stretching back to before the state, when he’d been\na favored protégé of Ben-Gurion. Walking away was going to be hard.

Avraham Aranan finally left the unit he’d imagined,\ncreated and built. He became the head of the technology unit in military\nintelligence. His deputy, Dovik Tamari, succeeded him, serving the first in what\nwould become two-year stints for each of his successors as the sayeret’s\ncommander. I, too, was given a wider role. Though I was still just a young\nlieutenant, and too junior for the job, Dovik made me his de facto deputy, with\nresponsibility for operational oversight of our missions. I returned to the Sinai a\nyear later, not in that capacity but because of my on-the-ground experience, to\naccompany a sayeret team which installed an intercept on a second Egyptian\ncommunications cable.\n\nThough the tzalash was gratifying, what gave me more satisfaction, and\npride, was the importance of the Sinai operations themselves. I was confident\nthat if we did have to go to war again, the equipment we installed, along with\nthe bugs on the Golan, would give us an essential edge. But in truth, I didn’t\nactually believe there would be another war. Sure, the threat was still there.\nEgypt, in particular, still seemed determined to find a way to hobble, and if\npossible eliminate, Israel. But especially since the 1956 war, the fedayeen\nattacks, and cross-border skirmishes, had been subsiding. Not long after the\nsecond Sinai intercept mission, I was chatting with other officers on the sayeret\nbase and remember turning to one of them and saying I was sure that by the\ntime I was married and had a teenage child, we’d be able to take a skiing\nholiday in Lebanon. We didn’t have peace yet. That might take time. But I felt\nthat things were getting more normal.\n\nI began thinking what that would mean not just for Sayeret Matkal or Israel,\nbut for my own future. By the autumn of 1964, Pd reached a decision: to end\nmy active service in the unit that had been central to my life since leaving the\nkibbutz. Dovik did persuade me to delay, for nearly a year. But at the end of the\nsummer of 1965, I left Sayeret Matkal. In fact, I left the army altogether. I went\nto study mathematics and physics at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. I would\nremain involved in the sayeret as a reservist. But I couldn’t see devoting my\nadult life to military service in a country which, fortunately, seemed on a\ntrajectory toward peace.

It will not be my function \nto recommend what should be done, but rather to place certain data and basic elements on the table for \ndecision-makers. They will know what is best for them to do. \nThe SWOT analysis, as we know, lists the positive Strengths, the present Opportunities, the Weaknesses \nperceived, and the Threats detected. \nStrengths \n1. The thawing announced simultaneously by Presidents Barack Obama and Ratll Castro \nlast December 17th, to which are added the various steps taken by both governments in \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025094 \nthe direction of reconciliation, have created an atmosphere of triumphalism regarding \nthe economic future of Cuba loaded with good expectations. \n2. According to the surveys, support for Obama's measures is notably of the majority in \nboth the United States and Cuba, but there are reasons to believe that a substantial \npercentage of Cuban exiles also support it. \n3. As part of this approach, it's expected that some or many foreign companies will explore \nthe possibility of investing in the Island. There is significant human capital available in \nCuba: over eight hundred thousand university students and a generally healthy and \neducated populace. \n4. The Cuban government, after 56 years of continuous exercise of power, appears solidly \nin control of the situation, without any person or group whatsoever that visibly \nchallenges its authority with any possibility of success. \n5. After Hugo Chavez's election to the presidency of Venezuela at the end of 1998, that oil-\nproducing country transferred to Cuba enormous amounts of resources. The economist \nCarmelo Mesa-Lago calculates the annual amount of aid at its highest point as thirteen \nbillion dollars. \n6. A quarter century after the disappearance of the Communist block, the Castro \ngovernment, together with North Korea, has shown itself to be the exception to the rule: \nIt has maintained control without renouncing the principles of Marxism-Leninism and \nthe single party system, although cautiously attempting to modify its productive \napparatus. \n7. In that spirit of \"reforms-within-the-system,\" in April 2010 Raul Castro presented what \nare known as Guidelines, outlining his reform of the State, creating spaces for foreign \ninvestment and \"freelancers.\" \n8. The most important or most visible institutions in Cuban society, such as the Armed \nForces and the Assembly of the People's Power, appear to fully support the steps taken \nby the president, General Rail Castro, in the direction of a re-encounter with the United \nStates. \n9. Some foreign offices of the European Union, such as the Spaniards, the Germans, and \nthe Dutch, look favorably on what is happening, as does the Vatican, which has \nparticipated in the secret meetings to bring an end to the conflicts between Cuba and \nthe United States. Pope Francis has announced his upcoming visit to Cuba as a kind of \nsupport for the changes. \n10. Cuba exercises enormous influence in the countries of the ALBA, and the clear \nleadership of the group known as the nations of the XXIth Century Socialism: Venezuela, \nBolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua. \n11. To this list we must add the sympathy and solidarity that Cuba inspires in governments \nsuch as those of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, and El Salvador. In summary, the \nIsland has never had a more international identification. \nOpportunities \n1. The country needs to rebuild almost all of its infrastructure. Everything is obsolete or in \nruins: aqueducts and sewerage systems, electrical grids, the Internet, bridges and roads, \ntelecommunications, homes and buildings. \n2. There is fertile land for the local production of food. Cuba imports 80% of the food \nconsumed by people and animals. Before 1959 the proportion was reversed. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025095 \n3. The sugar industry, which before the revolution was the backbone of the economy, with \nan annual average production of six million tons, has dropped to two. \n4. Tourism is a very promising field. The Island, very beautiful and with dozens of beaches, \nhas at least 14 points on both coasts that are potentially transformable into ideal sites \nfor building tourism poles similar to Puerto Banils in Spain or Casa de Campo in La \nRomana, Dominican Republic. \n5. Considering the number of researchers in the field of medicine, totally under-utilized, \nthe country would potentially be the perfect partner of large international \npharmaceutical industries, to both develop new medications and produce them. \n6. Given the prestige (today somewhat reduced) of its health system, Cuba is potentially an \nexcellent site for medical tourism and a place to establish links with the North American \ninsurance systems. Havana is much closer to Key West than Miami is to Orlando in \nFlorida. \n7. Whenever relations are really normalized and travel is facilitated and multiplies, Cuba \nwill become an ideal place to retire for tens of thousands of Cuban Americans and North \nAmericans who perceive an average of US$1,800 a month. \n8. Cuba receives some three million tourists every year, and has eleven million inhabitants. \nIn a few years it could receive eleven million tourists and reach the classification of \nparadise. A few daring and intelligent developers could transform the Isle of Pines, in \nCuba's south, into the Mallorca of the Caribbean. In the United States there are 300,000 \nluxury yachts that could visit Cuba and dock in already existing as well as future marinas. \n9. If relations between the United States and Cuba continue to deepen, it's possible to \nforesee a Free Trade Agreement that would allow the Island unlimited exports to the \nrichest market in the world. \n10. Because of its geographical position, Cuba is an ideal hub for the distribution of ocean-\ngoing and air cargo to North and South America. \n11. Cuban-Americans, as occurred in the case of Taiwan and China, could transfer to Cuba \ntheir business expertise, their relationships, and the capital they've created, which \nwould integrate the Island into the business and trade world of the United States. \n12. The country, as happened in post-Communist Europe, would be the paradise of the best-\nknown North American fast-foot franchises such as MacDonalds, Burger King, KFC, etc.. \n13. The same thing would occur with department store chains: Zara, Corte Ingles, Macys, \nSears, and the rest of the best known establishments. \nWeaknesses \n1. The government of Raul Castro doesn't want a regime change but rather an \nimprovement of the Communist model initiated in 1959. According to published and \nverbal statements, the model foreseen isn't even the Chinese or Vietnamese model, but \nrather a Military Capitalism of State, where the government reserves the control of the \n2,500 largest enterprises in the country, which it exploits directly through the military \napparatus or in partnership with foreign capitalists. Cubans will not have access to the \nmeans of production, but rather to small service enterprises (small food businesses, \nbeauty salons, etc.). \n2. The government of Raul Castro does not believe, as Deng Xiaoping proclaimed in 1992, \nthat \"enriching oneself is glorious.\" Raul and Fidel continue to believe that capitalism is \nan evil expression of the worst human tendencies, and despite those who practice it. In \nCuba, entrepreneurs are not encouraged, but discouraged. Capitalists may be \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025096 \ntemporarily necessary, but always under the strict control of the political police in order \nto avoid ideological contamination of the people and the excesses of which they are \ncapable. The government continues to uphold the supremacy of centralized planning \nover the market, and the virtues of frugality and non-consumption. \n3. If an entrepreneur wants to evaluate the country risk before investing anywhere, he \nlooks at the Moody's or Standard & Poor's ratings. According to these risk rating \ncompanies, Cuba appears on the most dangerous fringe. There is a very long history of \narrests or simply noncompliance with obligations, and of re-financing which has turned \nout to be useless. They haven't been able to pay their debts due to a serious and basic \nproblem: Cuban society is very unproductive due to the collectivist economic system \nthat they have imposed on it, and because of the size and priorities of public \nexpenditures decided on by the government. \n4. The Cuban State lacks substantial reserves, and barely generates sufficient income to \nsurvive from month to month. This means that it does not have its own resources to \nundertake the large public works that it needs, and it requires international loans in \norder to confront them, which becomes a serious problem because it does not possess \nreliable credit. \n5. In Cuba there are no impartial courts to which one can resort in the case of a dispute of \ncivil law, much less criminal law. There is an absolute legal defenselessness in the face \nof any conflict with the government or with a state-owned enterprise. The government, \naccording to its needs, arbitrarily pursues, imprisons, or releases any citizen, including \nforeign businessmen with whom it has a dispute. In other words, the reverse of a true \nState of Law. That circumstance can be testified to by dozens of persons, including the \nPanamanian Simon Abadi, the Chilean Max Marambio, or the Canadian SArkis \nYacoubian. \n6. Foreign businessmen located in Cuba live under the \"not-so-discreet\" surveillance of the \nsecurity forces, always in the paranoid search for the mythical and evil agent of the CIA. \nMany of the Cuban officials and simple neighbors or potential friends don't dare to link \nthemselves to foreign businessmen out of fear of losing the government's trust, or are \nforced to inform in writing about any voluntary or involuntary contact they've had with \nthem. \n7. Cuba has not resolved the very important problem of currency. Officially, the dollar \nexchange is approximately on a par with the Cuban peso. On the parallel market it's 24 \npesos to 1 dollar. Cubans collect in pesos, but the government sells to them in dollars, \nwhich creates significant dissatisfaction and an obvious sense of injustice. \n8. Salaries are very low (some US$24 a month), which determines the nonexistence of a \npotential market of 11 million consumers. Cubans have the lowest purchasing power \nper capita in Spanish-speaking America. \n9. The banking system is insufficient and primitive. Dollar deposits — as has happened in \nthe recent past — may be frozen at the discretion of the government. \n10. Bureaucracy is very slow and insecure. Officials don't dare to make decisions, and the \ninstructions they receive are sometimes contradictory. \n11. The hiring of workers is done through a state-owned company that charges investors in \ndollars and pays in pesos to the Cubans assigned to these jobs. In the transaction, the \nCuban State keeps 94% of the salary. That practice contravenes international \nagreements signed with the ILO. \n12. For over half a century, Cubans have been accustomed to stealing from the State in \norder to survive, by swelling on the black market the product of that theft. These habits \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025097 \nare transferred to the private sector, particularly because they have lived under an \nintense propaganda campaign against the capitalist exploiters. They know that \nsocialism leads to disaster, but they believe that capitalism is an activity of hungry \nwolves. \nThreats \n1. A substantial part of the policy of reconciliation between Obama and Rat.11 Castro \ndepends on the lifting of the embargo. Although there is great pressure from the White \nHouse, and surveys showing that the majority of Americans want the sanctions to end, \nthere are no guarantees that this will be achieved during this presidency. Neither can \none predict what will happen with the relations between the two countries if the next \nelections are won by a Republican candidate. Two of the most prominent ones, Jeb \nBush and Marco Rubio, have criticized President Obama for his new Cuban policy. \n2. The repeal of the 1996 Helms-Burton is one of the key requirements for Cuba to be able \nto approach the IDB, the IMF, or the World Bank. Without that credit, which requires \nCuba's affiliation with these organizations, the Island will have no access to loans to \nrebuild the costly infrastructure that the country needs. It's a very slow process that will \ntake a great deal of time. \n3. Cuba depends in large measures on subsidies from Venezuela, and Chavism is going \nthrough a very bad time, which could end up in its destruction and substitution with a \ngovernment unfavorable to \"the Cubans.\" The disappearance of Chavism in Venezuela \nwould be an economic and political catastrophe for Cuba. Today the popularity of \nNicolas Maduro is less than 20%. \n4. The political stability of the Cuban regime until now has depended on control by Fidel \nand Rat.11 Castro. Fidel just turned 89, and Rat.il will be 84 in June. With them the \ngeneration of the revolution will come to an end, giving way to younger people, led by \nRaCJI Castro's chosen heir, Engineer Miguel Diaz-Canel, who is 55. What's going to \nhappen then? Could the regime transmit the authority within the Community single-\nparty model without the old leaders who until now have lent shape and sense to the \ngovernment. Will there arise other candidates with uncontrollable ambitions, \npresumably young military men, with the intention of taking command? Nobody knows. \nNevertheless, Cuban history has been bloody when regimes reach their end. They are \nreplaced by violence. \n5. It will be very risky to invest in properties confiscated from their legitimate owners \nduring the first years of the revolution. In both the United States and Spain there are \norganizations of those injured who are willing to go to court in defense of their rights, \nand who have hired lawyers to do just that. Originally the victims of the confiscations \nwere North Americans or Spaniards, but over time Cuban-Americans and Hispano-\nCubans have been added. Both the United States Congress and Senate and the Spanish \nParliament have legislators with these origins. \n6. What will probably happen will be something similar to the case of Nicaragua. \nNicaraguan exiles, infinitely fewer in number and power than the Cuban-Americans, \nwithout congressmen in Washington with their origins, managed to condition American \naid to the solution of the confiscations they had suffered during the first decade of the \nSandinista government. What's predictable is that the injured Americans, together with \nthe Cuban-Americans, will manage to halt any American aid or benefit destined for Cuba \nuntil their property is returned to them or they are compensated for them. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025098 \n7. Although in the tourism sector there is an evident possibility of making money in Cuba, \nit's doubtful that the North American hotel industry, almost all present on the Stock \nExchange, subject to North American legislation and union pressure, would lend itself to \ncollaborating with the Cuban counter-intelligence by facilitating eavesdropping/wire-\ntapping and clandestine filming inside hotel installations, such as today occurs in Melia \nand other European chains, violating even Cuban law which supposedly defends the \ninviolability of privacy. American lawyers are very clear about the high price German \ncompanies had to pay when they associated themselves with Nazism, as occurred with \nVolkswagen and Bayer. \n8. Even though this is not a matter of investing in a country living under a dictatorship, but \nrather of associating oneself with a dictatorial government in order to exploit workers \nand companies, it's very possible that, whenever the opportunity presents itself, those \nbusinessmen linked to the Cuban government are going to be accused in court because \nof the confiscation of 94% of the salary through the exchange of dollars for pesos and \nother violations of the rules of the International Labor Organization. Workers' claims \nwill be very high, and there are American law firms willing to bring them in exchange for \na percentage of whatever is eventually received. \n9. Lastly, two articles of the Cuban constitution profile the inflexibly Communist nature of \nthe regime, and become a permanent threat against foreign investors. Article 5: The \nCommunist Party of Cuba, Marti-inspired and Marxist-Leninist, organized vanguard of \nthe Cuban nation, is the superior directing force of society and the State. Article 62: \nNone of the liberties recognized to citizens may be exercised against what is established \nin the Constitution and laws, or against the decision of the Cuban people to build \nsocialism and communism. The violation of this principle is punishable. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025099 \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I personally thought it was a great match for \nyour business needs in Qatar. If for any reason your decision was based on crew issues and charter needs in the Middle East, I'd like \nto share some information that might prove beneficial to making you reconsider this purchase. \nThe pilot candidates I have lined up for your interview along with the possibility of David Rodgers joining your flight department \nwere as follows: \n(at no time did I disclose location or persons to the following pilot candidates to protect your privacy.) \nRobert Breslin, who is the former Chief Pilot of Mr. Donald Trump, Mr. Breslin flew the Boeing 727 and Boeing 757 owned by Mr \nTrump.

Mr. Bartakowski has also \nbeen involved in charter operations in Africa and Middle East and has contacted me on several recent occasions with charters for \nour Boeing 727, James has indicated there is the possibility of 40 — 60 hours per month charter operations for larger transport \ncategory aircraft in your area.

Mr. Jafahri currently lives in California and ready for a new opportunity. Bruce is current in the Boeing 727 and \nalso flew Captain on the Boeing 747. Well qualified individual and personable. \nMr. El Sayed, as you have seen during our demo flight, our Boeing 727 is in impeccable condition, quite cabin and will provide many \nyears of charter and business flights your company. I believe the large business jet future in Qatar is growing and you will be leading \nits path, and your initial investment in this purchase will not come close with other aircraft options on the market as you may have \nseen already. \nWe are currently completing the C2C check on the Boeing, and as we have done in the past, assure you it will be a fine aircraft \nwhen it leaves Flight Star Maintenance repair facility. \nSincerely, \nLawrance Visoski \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033466 \nChief Pilot, JEGE Inc. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033467 \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The\nmap and compass helped. But I soon realized that it was almost impossible to\nget an accurate reading from inside the truck. Every few minutes, I waved the\nconvoy to stop, got out, and walked fifty or sixty yards into the sand and clumps\nof acacia trees and calibrated our progress from there. My fallback was the\nstars. From them, I could at least make sure we were headed in broadly the right\ndirection. But the need to navigate around the dunes meant we were never\nmoving in a perfectly straight line. The miles ticking by on the truck’s odometer\ncouldn’t tell me exactly how far we’d travelled. A couple of times, I realized we\nwere wandering off line — not by a much, but enough to risk leaving us either a\nmile or two south of where we were supposed to go or, worse, on the Egyptian\nside of an unmarked desert frontier that, especially at night, would look pretty\nmuch the same on either side.\n\nFinally, a few hours before dawn, I brought the convoy to a halt. I climbed\nout, walked back to the staff sergeant and told him, with more confidence than I\nfelt: “We’re here.” I had no way of knowing for sure. But I felt we were\ngenerally in the right place. Before we’d set off, I was briefed by the officer in\ncharge of one of the operational APC battalions. He had been to the area before,\non training exercises. Because of the emergency call-up, he was too senior to\nlead a supply convoy. But he told me that once we got there, we should stop and\nwait. He would follow our tracks the next morning and link up with us. An hour\nafter sunrise, we saw his jeep bobbing over the sand towards us. He pulled to a\nstop, shook hands with the staff sergeant, and then he turned to me.\n“Unbelievable,” he said. ““We’re where we need to be.”\n\nOur role in the grand scheme of things, and certainly mine, was hardly\ndecisive. But the rest of the border mobilization also went to plan. That, along\nwith some frantic diplomatic activity and a healthy common sense on all sides,\nensured that a new war with Egypt was averted — at least for a further half-\ndozen years, until 1967. By then, the lesson of Rotem would be learned: our\nneed to find a realiable way to tap into the battle plans of the hostile Arab states\naround us. And through another wholly unexpected turn of events starting just a\nfew weeks after the Rotem Crisis, I would turn out to play a personal role in\nmaking that happen.\n\n53\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027901\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Tasked to modify and refurbish a\nGlobal 5000 for the sports entertainment giant, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE,\nformerly WWF), New York-based International Jet Interiors is putting a progressive spin\non cabin design. While the livery boasts WWE’s corporate colours, the interiors use\n“hand-woven carpets, custom-made metal finishes including a spun black pearl finish,\ncustom-dyed leathers and bespoke seating from Italy”, says Eric Roth, the designer at\nInternational Jet Interiors’ helm.\nBut the highlight is in the high-tech facilities: studio-grade equipment that enables on-thefly\nediting of feeds from live sports entertainment shows, which are transmitted via on-board\nsatellite. Meanwhile, specially programmed iPad minis control the cabin functions. “It will be\nthe ultimate couture craft when completed in January 2014,” says Roth.\nNo stranger to special client requests, Roth says he loves the challenge — the more unusual\nthe request, the more he and his team seem to excel in delivering the solution. His clients\ncome from around the world with a varied wish-list, ranging from entertainment systems with\nsatellite TV and high-speed WiFi to 24-karat gold-plated fixtures throughout the craft. >>\nThe more unusual the request, the more Roth and\nhis team seem to excel in delivering the solution\nJETGALA\n49\nWINGS\n“Helping clients strategise is a key part of the\ndesign process. I look at how long they have owned\nthe craft and at its depreciating asset value”\n50 jetGALA\nDetails set Roth’s work\napart from other aircraft\ninteriors — from the\nchoice of lighting, carpet,\nupholstery and cabinetry,\nto gadget stowage and\ndining accessories\n>> Its refurbishment of Donald Trump’s Boeing 757,\nfor instance, included a 24-karat gold-plated bathroom\nsink. Other projects have required reconfiguring the\nseating layout to make kennel space for hunting dogs,\ninstalling ultra-secure bassinets for newborn infants,\nand wrapping a toilet seat in crocodile skin for a client\nin India.\nRoth says that as a designer and design director,\nhis main task is to develop an intimate understanding\nof a client’s lifestyle and his use of the jet — the\npercentage of time spent for business, pleasure,\ncorporate entertainment and family time. “Helping\nclients strategise is a key part of the design process. I\nlook at how long they have owned the craft and at its\ndepreciating asset value, and work out if it’s worth it to\ninvest in the latest piece of technology or ultra comfort\naccessory. Most of them will opt for the investment\nbecause they want their aircraft to be up-to-date, even if\nthis does not up its asset value.”\nAt times, thorough strategising is needed even before\nInternational Jet Interiors accepts a project. A US-based\nfilm producer once wanted a ‘sky studio’ so that he\nand his four-member team could edit films onboard\nhis Gulfstream. This required state-of-the-art editing\nequipment, surround sound, and a 42-inch, flat-screen,\nhigh-definition TV. “The client perceived the theatre >>\nJETGALA\n51\nWINGS\n52 jetGALA\n>> aspect as the great challenge — yet it was balancing\nthe weight of the floor-plan change and equipment\nfurnishing that was the real challenge. The structural\nand technical analysis consumed the better part of\nthree weeks before we could make the commitment to\nproduce this unique aircraft,” says Roth.\nDespite many quirky refurbishing requests, Roth says\na fair percentage of his clients avoid using their aircraft\nto make a statement: “They will come to me saying ‘Eric,\nI want it to be luxuriously comfortable,\nvery functional but extremely understated’.” Nearly\n75 per cent of the firm’s clients are US-based, but it is\nnow receiving more requests from private-jet owners in\nAsia. The company has worked with clients in Shanghai,\nTokyo and Mumbai, and is in discussions with new\ncustomers in Africa.\nHe hopes to one day produce a “green and\nsustainable” solution for a client. That may sound like\nan oxymoron, and it will take a designer used to pushing\nthe limits of convention to create such a ground-breaking\ndesign. It looks like Roth is cut out for the job.\nOPPOSITE\nInternational Jet Interiors\nachieves a sleek, streamlined\nappeal by modifying an\naircraft’s window line\nand periphery, and using\ncomposite materials\nexclusively\nTHIS PAGE\nHand-stitched leathers and\nfinely woven fabrics create\na luxurious, comfortable\nambiance\nGadgets can be configured\nto control the lightings in the\ncabin interior\n“Clients come to me\nsaying ‘Eric, I want it to be\nluxuriously comfortable,\nvery functional but\nextremely understated’.”\nJETGALA\n53\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

As part of the AGI Roadmap project, specific tasks were created corresponding\nto each of the sub-areas in the above list; we will describe some of these tasks in Chapter 17.\n\n2.3.2 Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences\n\nThe diverse list of human-level “competencies” given above is reminiscent of Gardner’s [Gar99|\nmultiple intelligences (MI) framework — a psychological approach to intelligence assessment\nbased on the idea that different people have mental strengths in different high-level domains,\nso that intelligence tests should contain aspects that focus on each of these domains separately.\nMI does not contradict the “complex goals in complex environments” view of intelligence, but\nrather may be interpreted as making specific commitments regarding which complex tasks and\nwhich complex environments are most important for roughly human-like intelligence.\n\nMI does not seek an extreme generality, in the sense that it explicitly focuses on domains\nin which humans have strong innate capability as well as general-intelligence capability; there\ncould easily be non-human intelligences that would exceed humans according to both the com-\nmonsense human notion of “general intelligence” and the generic “complex goals in complex\nenvironments” or Hutter /Legg-style definitions, yet would not equal humans on the MI crite-\nria. This strong anthropocentrism of MI is not a problem from an AGI perspective so long as\none uses MI in an appropriate way, i.e. only for assessing the extent to which an AGI system\ndisplays specifically human-like general intelligence. This restrictiveness is the price one pays\nfor having an easily articulable and relatively easily implementable evaluation framework.\n\nTable ?? summarizes the types of intelligence included in Gardner’s MI theory.\n\nIntelligence Type Aspects\nLinguistic Words and language, written and spoken; retention, inter-\n\npretation and explanation of ideas and information via lan-\nguage; understands relationship between communication\nand meaning\n\nLogical-Mathematical Logical thinking, detecting patterns, scientific reasoning\nand deduction; analyse problems, perform mathematical\ncalculations, understands relationship between cause and\neffect towards a tangible outcome\n\nMusical Musical ability, awareness, appreciation and use of sound;\nrecognition of tonal and rhythmic patterns, understands\nrelationship between sound and feeling\n\nBodily-Kinesthetic Body movement control, manual dexterity, physical agility\nand balance; eye and body coordination\n\nSpatial-Visual Visual and spatial perception; interpretation and creation\nof images; pictorial imagination and expression; under-\nstands relationship between images and meanings, and be-\ntween space and effect\n\nInterpersonal Perception of other people’s feelings; relates to others; inter-\npretation of behaviour and communications; understands\nrelationships between people and their situations\n\nTable 2.1: Types of Intelligence in Gardner’s Multiple Intelligence Theory\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012941\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Why not build a tower out of triangles?\nOr maybe a vaguely tower-like structure that uses more triangles than a tower easily\ncould?\n\n— Example: Building an elongated block structure resembling a table was successful in the\npast, as was building a structure resembling a very flat version of a chair. Generalizing,\nmaybe building distorted versions of furniture is good. Or maybe it is building distorted\nversion of any previously perceived objects that is good. Or maybe both, to different\ndegrees...\n\nNext, for a variety of reasons outlined in [Goe(6a] it becomes appealing to hypothesize that the\nnetwork of patterns in an intelligent system must give rise to the following large-scale emergent\nstructures\n\ne Hierarchical network. Patterns are habitually in relations of control over other patterns that\nrepresent more specialized aspects of themselves.\n\n— Example: The pattern associated with “tall building” has some control over the pattern\nassociated with “tower”, as the former represents a more general concept ... and “tower”\nhas some control over “Eiffel tower”, etc.\n\ne Heterarchical network. The system retains a memory of which patterns have previously\nbeen associated with each other in any way.\n\n— Example: “Tower” and “snake” are distant in the natural pattern hierarchy, but may be\nassociatively /heterarchically linked due to having a common elongated structure. This\nheterarchical linkage may be used for many things, e.g. it might inspire the creative\nconstruction of a tower with a snake’s head.\n\ne Dual network. Hierarchical and heterarchical structures are combined, with the dynamics\nof the two structures working together harmoniously. Among many possible ways to hier-\narchically organize a set of patterns, the one used should be one that causes hierarchically\nnearby patterns to have many meaningful heterarchical connections; and of course, there\nshould be a tendency to search for heterarchical connections among hierarchically nearby\npatterns.\n\n— Example: While the set of patterns hierarchically nearby “tower” and the set of patterns\nheterarchically nearby “tower” will be quite different, they should still have more overlap\nthan random pattern-sets of similar sizes. So, if looking for something else heterarchically\nnear “tower”, using the hierarchical information about “tower” should be of some use,\nand vice versa.\n\n— In PLN, hierarchical relationships correspond to Atoms A and B so that InheritanceAB\nand InheritanceB A have highly dissimilar strength; and heterarchical relationships cor-\nrespond to IntensionalSimilarity relationships. The dual network structure then arises\nwhen intensional and extensional inheritance approximately correlate with each other,\nso that inference about either kind of inheritance assists with figuring out about the\nother kind.\n\ne Self structure. A portion of the network of patterns forms into an approximate image of the\noverall network of patterns.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012955\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It is not simply\nthat we’re enmeshed in networks now; no, we're enclosed even entrapped by them.\nIf the great ambition of Cecil Rhodes’ era was for the expansive conquest of\nterritory, in our own it is for the construction and manipulation of gated spaces.\nGatelands.\n\nIn an age of network power, no position is more important, formidable, influential\nor profitable than that of the gatekeeper. Defining who is in or out of any network is\namong the most essential moves of design. In financial markets, on the Internet\nbackbone or inside the human immune system, the accept-or-reject decision\ndetermines a great deal. The first sign of order breaking down, whether it is the\nRoman Empire or your lungs, is an inability to manage what slips in and out. Flows\nof bits, of migrants, of gold and patents and medicines -— all of these life-giving forces\ncan be controlled, bent for good or stopped for ill, as they pass through or collide\nwith gates. By gates I mean not only in-out passages but all of the tools that meter\nand enclose the various Gatelands: Protocols, languages, block-chains. Whatever\nbinds and shapes an information topology. Any sort of code or encryption or binary\ninstruction that can unlock an in and out. If you want to make a fortune or a\nrevolution (or both), if you hope to shatter some barrier of tools or ideas between\nyou and a dream, or to lead a religious revival, spread an infection of hate or\nrevolution or insidious Morris-style computer code — then fundamentally this is\nwhat you have to consider: Where are the gates? How to smash them? How to build\nyour own? We are entering, as a result of our dependence on networks of all sorts, a\nlandscape where the very clustering of power creates new border regions, bridges\nand gates. If older, hierarchical systems craved a top - a king, a superpower, a Pope\n- our connected, meshlike age demands valves and protocols and gates. It hungers\nfor connection, which means it hungers too for throttles and accelerators and\nbrakes. And of course people to run them. To speed them up. Slow them. Finger off\nswitches. This reordering of power will produce, is producing, a fight over\ntopological spaces for finance, biology, trade or pretty much any source of power.\nThe scramble is as urgent, decisive and essential as the one Rhodes and his peers\nembarked upon. Inside or out? A fresh Meliananxiety haunts us: Are you the\ngatekeeper? Or the gatekept?\n\nWe wander into Gateland the moment we switch our phones on. We enter it when\nwe book an airline ticket, when our genetics folds into a pool of data, or when we\ntake a new degree, master a computer language, or check on friends via one stateful\nconnected platform or another. We enter it, in short, when we connect. Gatekeepers\nchoose what we see. They determine the rules we follow, what we can and can’t\nchange. They reward us too - once we're inside — with benefits of speed, knowledge\nand safety. Gatekeepers, which can be people or protocols or code, decide who can\njoin closed communities and who is left out and why. They pass us the fine benefit of\nthe compression of time, even as they expose us to the zipper of instant potential\ndisaster hitting everyone in a closed space at once. Gatekeepers control, for instance,\nhow (and how fast) financial data moves between members of light-speed “in the\nknow” trading pools, and the suckers outside.

I\nassumed it belonged to General Yoffe, who was known to be an avid hunter and\nwould later become the head of Israel’s National Parks Authority. It had a\npadlocked metal grill on the back which held two jerrycans of gasoline. Yori\nCohen, the commander of the back-up team, and I spotted the fuel containers at\nthe same time. We couldn’t help smiling. Yes, we were about to embark on an\noperation which, assuming we didn’t fail, would finally give Israel real-time\nintelligence from across our border for the first time since the 1950s. But we\nwere still Sayeret Matkal, still chronically short of gasoline for our field\nexercises. And I still hadn’t forgotten how to pick a lock. As Yori stood guard, I\nbroke into the grill and removed the jerrycans, one for each of us, and closed it\nagain. Then, after briefing the general, we headed to our setting-off point.

In Nielsen, U.S. bottled water generated just over $13 bn in 2018.\nAssuming Nielsen channels account for 50% coverage of the category implies total\nrevenues of over $26 bn. Applying the 4.2% CAGR the category has grown over the last\n3 years and extrapolating out results in total revenue surpassing $28 bn by 2020. Our\nestimates are premised on CBD water achieving a ~1.5% market share in 2019 anda\nconservative ~2% market share of the U.S. bottled water category in 2020. We would\nnote that a ~2% share of the bottled water category compares to a ~3% share for\ncoconut water. With the amount of consumer interest and potential functional benefits\nthat come along with CBD, we believe that a modest 2% share of the category is\nreasonable, in particular if multiple larger players within the beverage space enter the\ncategory and drive distribution.

Israel's \nrecent battle with the armed Hamas \nmovement in the Gaza Strip left many  \npredicting a wider fight in the future, as \ndivisions deepened within the Palestinian \nand Israeli electorates over whether talks \nor war would resolve the conflict. \n\"To make it a substantive trip that is \nmore than a positive photo-op would \nrequire setting up a specific framework \nfor an agreement and setting a tight \ndeadline to achieve it,\" said Jeremy Ben-\nAmi, the executive director of J Street, a \nnonprofit group that advocates the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029693 \ncreation of a Palestinian state alongside \nIsrael. \nWhite House officials would not provide \na date for Obama's trip, which he will \nsqueeze into the tight schedule he is \nbuilding around a busy domestic agenda \nthat includes immigration, guns and the \neconomy. \nBut Israeli media reported that Obama is \nscheduled to arrive March 20 as part of a \ntrip that will include a stop in Jordan, \nwhere the civil war in next-door Syria \nand its growing refugee crisis is \npresenting a major challenge to King \nAbdullah II, a U.S. ally. \nObama began his first term by making a \nstrong push for peace talks between Israel \nand the Palestinians, believing the \nconflict fueled radicalism in the region in \ngeneral and toward the United States in \nparticular, given its historical support for \nthe Jewish state. \nIn contrast to predecessor George W. \nBush, Obama wanted to demonstrate to \nArab governments that the United States \nwould make demands of Israel in pursuit \nof a regional peace agreement. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin \nNetanyahu made little secret of his \npreference for Republican Mitt Romney  \nin last year's U.S. presidential campaign. \nNetanyahu and Obama have at times \ndisagreed bitterly over issues relating to \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029694 \nthe Palestinians, including Israel's \ncontinued settlement construction in the \nWest Bank and East Jerusalem. \nIsrael's military occupied those \nterritories, along with Gaza, in the 1967 \nArab-Israeli war. Palestinians view them \nas the key territorial elements of their \nfuture state. \nIn a June 2009 address in Cairo, a speech \nthat asked for a \"new beginning\" with the \nIslamic world, Obama said: \"The United \nStates does not accept the legitimacy of \ncontinued Israeli settlements.\" He also \ndid not stop in Israel on that trip, instead \nvisiting Saudi Arabia, Egypt and \nGermany, where he emphasized the  \nhorror of the Holocaust and the moral \nimperative of defending Israel. Romney, \namong others, made the omission a \ncampaign issue. \nBut on regional security issues, Obama \nand Netanyahu have deepened \ncooperation amid rising U.S. military aid \nto Israel. Obama has agreed with \nNetanyahu that Iran must not be allowed \nto use its uranium-enrichment program to \ndevelop a nuclear weapon, an issue that \nthe two will discuss during Obama's \nvisit. \nNetanyahu's Likud party emerged from \nelections last month as the largest bloc in \nIsrael's parliament, meaning that he will \nserve another term as prime minister. But \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029695 \na surprisingly strong showing by a new \ncentrist party is likely to put more \npressure on him to pursue talks. \n\"It was a mistake for Obama not to go in \nthe first term at a time when it could have \naffected Israeli public opinion of him, \nand now, it has hardened against him to a \npoint that I don't believe it can,\" said \nElliott Abrams, a senior fellow at the \nCouncil on Foreign Relations who served \nas a senior Middle East adviser to Bush. \nObama's visit will coincide with growing \nconcern in the region that the two-state \nsolution favored by him is in peril, as \nIsraeli settlement construction continues \nand as the Islamist Hamas gains clout \nwithin the once-secular Palestinian \nnationalist movement. Hamas emerged  \nstronger politically from the recent clash \nwith Israel and continues to reject the \nJewish state's right to exist. \nHamas and its secular rival Fatah are due \nto meet Saturday as part of a \nreconciliation process. If an agreement is \nreached and Hamas joins the Palestinian \nAuthority, Obama will be faced with an \nawkward decision on whether to meet \nwith a government that includes members \nof a U.S.-\ndesignated terrorist movement. \nAs he begins again in the region, Obama \nwill be advised by new Secretary of State \nJohn F. Kerry. He has also named former \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029696 \nsenator Chuck Hagel as defense \nsecretary, a nomination still in question \nafter an unsteady performance by the \ncandidate before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee last week that \nfocused in part on his past criticism of \nIsrael. \n\"This trip is a signal that the president \nhas an interest, not just in the peace issue, \nbut also in the broader concerns that \nIsrael is facing,\" said Dennis Ross, a \nsenior Middle East adviser to Obama \nduring his first term who is at the \nWashington Institute for Near East  \nPolicy. \"In some ways, it will be the \npresident traveling to Israel to ask for a \nnew beginning.\" \nArticle 2. \nForeign Policy \nSaeb Erekat - The Peace  \nProcessor  \nAn interview by Aaron David Miller \nFebruary 5, 2013 -- Other than Mahmoud \nAbbas, Saeb Erekat could be the most \nrecognizable Palestinian on the planet. \nThe chief Palestinian negotiator is \ncertainly among the most passionate in \npromoting the cause. And nobody on the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029697 \nPalestinian side knows the substance of \nthe issues or the negotiating history \nbetter. \nI first met Erekat in the late 1980s, while \nworking on the Palestinian issue for then \nSecretary of State George Shultz. Back \nthen, the U.S.-educated diplomat was \nalready showing the brashness and \noutspokenness that would make him one \nof the most memorable -- if exasperating \n-- of the Palestinians with whom we \ndealt. \nHe annoyed then Secretary of State \nJames Baker by wearing his kaffiyeh \naround his shoulders at the opening of the \nMadrid Peace Conference in October \n1991. And over the years, he continued to \nannoy the Israelis too with his fiery \nperformances on CNN -- though to this \nday, key Israeli negotiators, such as Isaac \nMolho, continue to praise his pragmatism \nat the bargaining table. \nIt was Erekat's academic bent, analytical \nchops, and capacity to write in English \nthat would make him so indispensable to \nthe only Palestinian who really counted \nin those days -- Yasir Arafat. Erekat was \na unique figure -- neither a fighter (no \nnom de guerre for him), nor a PLO \ninsider, nor an organization man from \nTunis. Rather, he was a West Banker \nfrom Jericho, and he succeeded in \nmaintaining his relevance in a Palestinian \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029698 \npolitical scene dominated not by fellow \nacademics, but by hard men defined by \nstruggle and intrigue. During the heady \ndays of the peace process, he became a \nkey point of contact for the Americans, \nthe Israelis, the Arabs, and much of the \nrest of the international community. \nI came to know Erekat not only as a \nnegotiator, but as a person. He sent his \nkids to Seeds of Peace, a conflict \nresolution and coexistence organization \nthat I ran briefly after leaving the State \nDepartment, and my daughter befriended \nhis and stayed with the Erekats in \nJericho. Saeb and I have yelled at each \nother, defended our respective positions, \nlaughed, and mourned opportunities that \nwere never adequately explored. But \nthrough it all, what he said about himself \nwas true: He wasn't as pro-Palestinian or \npro-Israeli as much as he was pro-peace. \nThat peace has proven elusive to this day. \nBut with all our differences -- and there \nare many -- I believe Erekat believes in \nits possibility. Who else would list as an \n\"objective\" on his resume: \"Solve the \nPalestinian-Israeli conflict based on a two \nstate negotiated solution through \ndiplomatic offices\"? \nIf, or perhaps when, another effort to \nnegotiate a deal is made, one thing is \nclear -- Erekat will be in the middle of it. \nLast week, he agreed to answer my \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029699 \nquestions on the past and future of the \nIsraeli-Palestinian problem. \nFP: What were your best and worst \nmoments in the Israeli-Palestinian \nnegotiations, and what was the greatest \nmissed opportunity? \nSaeb Erekat: Though I was not the chief \nnegotiator at that moment, the connection \nbetween [then Prime Minister Yitzhak] \nRabin and President Arafat made \neveryone around them, including myself, \nfeel that peace was possible. There was \nsignificant progress in all tracks until \nRabin's assassination by an Israeli \nterrorist -- after he was killed, no Israeli \nleader had the vision to understand that \nthe window of opportunity for a two-state \nsolution would close as fast as they \ncontinued their colonization policies. \nThe missed opportunity has definitely \nbeen Israel throwing away the Arab \nPeace Initiative, which offers \nnormalization of relations of 57 countries \nwith Israel in exchange for Israeli \nwithdrawal to the 1967 border. They \nthrew it away by bombing Gaza, by \nintensifying collective punishments, and \nby increasing settlement construction all \nover the occupied West Bank, \nparticularly in and around Occupied East \nJerusalem. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029700 \nFP: 2013 is the 20th anniversary of the \nOslo negotiations. What was Oslo's \ngreatest success, and its greatest failure? \nSE: The fact that, two decades after Oslo, \nwe are still a nation under occupation \nshows that Israeli governments did derail \nit. The interim accords were not supposed \nto last for 20 years but only five. After \nthat, we were going to enjoy freedom and \nsovereignty. \nBut Israel increased its settlement \nexpansion. In fact, within 20 years, the \nnumber of settlers almost tripled. The \ninstitution-building efforts led by the \nPalestinian government have been \ncompletely undermined by the lack of \nfreedom. This situation cannot continue. \nOslo succeeded in bringing back 250,000 \nPalestinians from the diaspora and \nbuilding the capacity for our state. The \ninternational community failed though, \nby granting Israel an unprecedented \nculture of impunity that allowed them to \nuse negotiations as a means to continue \nrather than stop colonization. \nFP: What is the most important \nthing Israelis don't understand about \nPalestinians? \nSE: That we are not going anywhere. As \nsimple as that. We are not going to \ndisappear just because their government \nbuilds an annexation wall around us. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029701 \nThey should close their eyes and imagine \ntheir state within 10 years time. What do \nthey see? If they continue their policies, \nthey are going to officially adopt the form \nof an apartheid regime, which I think is \nnot what many Israelis want. \nFP: What is the most important thing \nPalestinians have learned about Israelis? \nSE: That Israelis will not take back the \nships that brought them here to leave \nsomewhere else. We got to understand \nthat we have to live side by side. The \nrules of engagement, though, cannot be \nthose of apartheid, but those of freedom. \nFP: What do you expect from the next \nIsraeli government on the peace process? \nSE: I don't think there is room for \noptimism, but our position hasn't \nchanged. We don't see any other solution \nthan a two-state solution. Any Israeli \ngovernment that recognizes this fact and \nrespects what previous governments have \nagreed upon should become a partner for \npeace. \nFP: Is Hamas-Fatah unity possible, and \nwhat would the impact be on the future of \nIsraeli-Palestinian negotiations? \nSE: We expect to have progress in the \nnear future, with Hamas allowing the \nCentral Elections Commission to register \nnew voters in Gaza. I believe there is \npolitical agreement -- in fact, there is a \nsigned agreement. We expect to have \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029702 \nelections as soon as possible, which is the \nright way to solve our differences: Let \nour people decide, those in Palestine as \nwell as our people in the Diaspora. \nHaving said so, Hamas has recognized \nthe Palestine Liberation Organization as \nthe sole and legitimate representative of \nthe Palestinian people, including its \nmandate to negotiate a final status \nagreement with Israel. Once that is \nachieved, we expect to hold a national \nreferendum. \nFP: How would you describe Egypt's \nrole in the peace process now? What do \nyou expect from President Barack \nObama's administration with regards to \nthe peace process? \nSE: Egypt has played a central role, and \ncontinues to do so. We trust that Egypt, \nunder President Mohamed Morsy's \nleadership, will continue to play a strong \nrole because Palestine and Egypt have a \ncommon interest in achieving peace. \nPresident Obama had stated that he has a \npersonal commitment to bring peace to \nthe Middle East. We, the Egyptians, and \nthe rest of the Arab world tell him that we \nare ready for peace. We have the Arab \nPeace Initiative. This goes in line with \nthe stated U.S. national interest. \nWashington's failure to explicitly say that \nIsrael is to blame for choosing \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029703 \nsettlements over peace has contributed to \nIsrael's culture of impunity. \nFP: Can America be an effective broker \nin negotiations? \nSE: If the U.S. decides to be an honest \nbroker, it could not only be effective but \nin fact could bring real peace to the \nregion, a just and lasting one. The U.S. \nhas a moral obligation toward the \nPalestinian people, who have been under \noccupation and living in exile for \ndecades. \nFP: Is a two state solution still possible? \nSE: Yes, but only if there is a political \nwill. So far, Israel's will is about \ncolonization, and the international \ncommunity has failed to put an end to \ndecades of double standards by treating \nIsrael as a state above the law. We don't \nsee any other solution than a two-state \nsolution, though Israel is taking us to a \none-state reality. \nAaron David Miller is a distinguished \nscholar at the Woodrow Wilson \nInternational Center for Scholars. \nArticle 3. \nThe Daily Beast \nThe Mixed Legacy Of \nShimon Peres  \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029704 \nDaniel Gavron \nFeb 4, 2013 -- Now that he has finished \nhis consultations with the country's \npolitical parties and charged Benjamin \nNetanyahu with forming a new coalition, \nIsrael's respected President, Shimon \nPeres, is once again very much in the \nnews. In his speech inviting Netanyahu to \nform the next government, the President \nspoke forcefully about peace and even \nseemed to influence Bibi to mention \npeace, a word he never used in his \nelection campaign. Peres has rightly \nearned respect for this from many \nquarters, but now, as the coalition is \nbeing formed, it might be a good time to \nexamine one aspect of Israel's political \nculture: the lack of respect for the task of \na parliamentary opposition. Peres is at \nleast partly to blame for this, as he almost \nalways preferred to join various \nadministrations—even as a junior \npartner—rather than lead the opposition, \nofen citing \"our grave situation\" and \n\"national responsibility.\" Now is surely \na better time to criticize Peres than in \nJune, when the world (maybe even \nincluding President Barack Obama) will \nbe coming here to celebrate his 90th \nbirthday. Then, surely, everyone will be \npaying deserved tribute to the wisdom of \nthis elder statesman and prophet of peace, \nand it would be a shame to spoil the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029705 \nparty. So let's clear the air right now, \nwell before the festivities. Before we get \nto the matter of coalition politics, which \nis very much on our minds right now as \nNetanyahu struggles to put together a \ngovernment, let us consider the other \nnegative part of the Peres legacy: his stint \nas Defense Minister under Prime Minister \nYitzhak Rabin from 1974 to 1977. Today \nPeres is widely respected as the architect \nof the Oslo Accord of 1993, achieved \nwhile he was Foreign Minister. It was the \nfirst political move toward a settlement \nbetween Israel and the Palestinians, and \nPeres deserves huge credit for securing \nthe agreement. However, two decades \nearlier, as Defense Minister, he supported \nthe Jewish settlement project in the \nnewly-conquered Palestinian territories, \nboth overtly and covertly. Not for \nnothing did Rabin label Peres in his \nmemoirs as \"an indefatigable intriguer.\" \nIn 1975, while Rabin was doing his \nutmost to prevent the settlement of Elon \nMoreh, near Nablus, Peres continuously \nsabotaged his efforts. After no less than \neight settlement attempts, which were \nruled illegal by Israel's Supreme Court, a \n\"compromise\" was reached, and Elon \nMoreh was established five kilometers to \nthe east of the original site. Moreover, \nduring the furor over Elon Moreh, \nDefense Minister Peres quietly facilitated \nthe creation of Ofra, near Ramallah. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029706 \nThese two settlements, which have \nbecome flagships of the settlement \nmovement, were the start of Jewish \ncolonization in Samaria, the northern part \nof the West Bank. The previous year, as \na young reporter, I interviewed Peres, \nafter he and his political ally Moshe \nDayan had refused \"on principle\" to join \nthe government of Golda Meir. \"If a \nsingle child can learn that politics is not \njust intrigues,\" Peres told me, \"I will be \nsatisfied that we have done our bit.\" Just \none week later, when he and Dayan had \nreversed their position for no discernable \nreason, and were seated snugly around \nthe cabinet table, I asked Peres what he \nhad to say to the \"single child.\" His aides \nsniggered, but Peres didn't bat an eyelid: \n\"Just what my mentor, David Ben-Gurion \n(Israel's first Prime Minister) told me: \nwhen the security of Israel is laid on one \nside of the scales, and everything else on \nthe other side, security tips the \nbalance.\" Peres subsequently used that \nself-same argument to join every \ngovernment that would have him. The \nlate Menachem Begin lost nine elections \nbefore finally becoming Israel's Prime \nMinister in 1977. He served as a \npugnacious and dedicated leader of the \nopposition. Peres almost never headed \nthe opposition, always preferring a \nministerial appointment, once even \ndesigning a grotesque system of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029707 \n\"rotation\" with Yitzhak Shamir, so that \nhe could be in the government. He \nproposed the ideal of \"national unity,\" \nand greatly devalued the democratic \nconcept of parliamentary opposition. \nFormer Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni \nruined her reputation when she refused to \njoin Netanyahu in his last government. \nWhile it is quite true that Livni was an \nineffective opposition leader, it is the \nvery fact of her refusal to join the \nadministration and \"influence it from \nwithin\" that has provoked most of the \ncriticism by Israeli political \ncommentators. Similar criticism is \ncurrently being leveled at Labor Party \nleader Shelly Yachimovich for stating \nclearly that she would not join \nNetanyahu's next government, but would \nserve as leader of the opposition. There \nare certainly many reasons to criticize \nYachimovich, but not her eminently \ndemocratic decision to lead the \nparliamentary opposition. Very few of \nour political commentators have ever \nexpressed respect or even understanding \nfor the concept of opposition. The most \npopular political idea in Israel today is \nnational unity—better still, a National \nUnity Government: \"We should all rally \nround the flag and support our \ngovernment in these critical times.\" This \nposition, widely espoused, echoes what \nPeres has said repeatedly over the years. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029708 \nSo, although the Peres vision of peace is \na positive legacy, he has also taught us \nless helpful lessons. The settlements are a \nsupremely negative inheritance, but I \nwould argue that the anti-democratic \nrejection of the concept of a \nparliamentary opposition is an even more \nharmful bequest handed down to us by \nPresident Shimon Peres. \nDaniel Gavron, who lives in Israel, is a \nformer journalist and the author of nine \nbooks, the most recent of which is Holy \nLand Mosaic, stories of cooperation and \ncoexistence between Israelis and \nPalestinians (Rowman & Littlefield, \n2008). \nArticle 4. \nNYT \nIndia vs. China vs. Egypt \nThomas L. Friedman  \nFebruary 5, 2013 -- New Delhi -- It's \nhard to escape a visit to India without \nsomeone asking you to compare it to \nChina. This visit was no exception, but I \nthink it's more revealing to widen the \naperture and compare India, China and \nEgypt. India has a weak central \ngovernment but a really strong civil \nsociety, bubbling with elections and \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029709 \nassociations at every level. China has a \nmuscular central government but a weak \ncivil society, yet one that is clearly \nstraining to express itself more. Egypt, \nalas, has a weak government and a very \nweak civil society, one that was \nsuppressed for 50 years, denied real \nelections and, therefore, is easy prey to \nhave its revolution diverted by the one \ngroup that could organize, the Muslim \nBrotherhood, in the one free space, the \nmosque. But there is one thing all three \nhave in common: gigantic youth bulges \nunder the age of 30, increasingly \nconnected by technology but very \nunevenly educated. \nMy view: Of these three, the one that will \nthrive the most in the 21st century will be \nthe one that is most successful at \nconverting its youth bulge into a \n\"demographic dividend\" that keeps \npaying off every decade, as opposed to a \n\"demographic bomb\" that keeps going \noff every decade. That will be the society \nthat provides more of its youth with the \neducation, jobs and voice they seek to \nrealize their full potential. \nThis race is about \"who can enable and \ninspire more of its youth to help build \nbroad societal prosperity,\" argues Dov \nSeidman, the author of \"How\" and \nC.E.O. of LRN, which has an operating \ncenter in India. \"And that's all about \nleaders, parents and teachers creating \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029710 \nenvironments where young people can be \non a quest, not just for a job, but for a \ncareer — for a better life that doesn't just \nsurpass but far surpasses their parents.\" \nCountries that fail to do that will have a \nyouth bulge that is not only unemployed, \nbut unemployable, he argued. \"They will \nbe disconnected in a connected world, \ndespairing as they watch others build and \nrealize their potential and curiosity.\" \nIf your country has either a strong \ngovernment or a strong civil society, it \nhas the ability to rise to this challenge. If \nit has neither, it will have real problems, \nwhich is why Egypt is struggling. China \nleads in providing its youth bulge with \neducation, infrastructure and jobs, but \nlags in unleashing freedom and curiosity. \nIndia is the most intriguing case — if it \ncan get its governance and corruption \nunder control. The quest for upward \nmobility here, especially among women \nand girls, is palpable. I took part in the \ngraduation ceremony for The Energy and \nResources Institute last week. Of 12 \nawards for the top students, 11 went to \nwomen. \n\"India today has 560 million young \npeople under the age of 25 and 225 \nmillion between the ages of 10 and 19,\" \nexplained Shashi Tharoor, India's \nminister of state for human resource \ndevelopment. \"So for the next 40 years \nwe should have a youthful working-age \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029711 \npopulation\" at a time when China and the \nbroad industrialized world is aging. \nAccording to Tharoor, the average age in \nChina today is around 38, whereas in \nIndia it's around 28. In 20 years, that gap \nwill be much larger. So this could be a \nhuge demographic dividend — \"provided \nthat we can educate our youth — offering \nvocational training to some and \nuniversity to others to equip them to take \nadvantage of what the 21st-century global \neconomy offers,\" said Tharoor. \"If we get \nit right, India becomes the workhorse of \nthe world. If we get it wrong, there is \nnothing worse than unemployable, \nfrustrated\" youth. \nIndeed, some of India's disaffected youth \nare turning to Maoism in rural areas. \"We \nhave Maoists among our tribal \npopulations, who have not benefited from \nthe opportunities of modern India,\" \nTharoor said. There have been violent \nMaoist incidents in 165 of India's 625 \ndistricts in recent years, as Maoists tap \ninto all those left out of the \"Indian \ndream.\" So there is now a huge push here \nto lure poor kids into school. India runs \nthe world's biggest midday lunch \nprogram, serving 250 million free school \nlunches each day. It's also doubled its \nnumber of Indian Institutes of \nTechnology, from eight to 16, and is \nplanning 14 new universities for \ninnovation and research. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029712 \nBut this will all be for naught without \nbetter governance, argues Gurcharan Das, \nthe former C.E.O. of Procter & Gamble \nIndia, whose latest book is \"India Grows \nat Night: A Liberal Case for a Strong \nState.\" \"The aspirational India has no one \nto vote for, because no one is talking the \nlanguage of public goods. Why should it \ntake us 15 years to get justice in the \ncourts or 12 years to build a road? The \ngap between [youth] aspirations and \ngovernment performance is huge. My \nthesis is that India has risen despite the \nstate. It is a story of public failure and \nprivate success.\" \nThat is what Das means by India grows at \nnight, when government sleeps. \"But \nIndia must learn to grow during the day,\" \nhe said. \"If India fixes its governance \nbefore China fixes its politics that is who \nwill win. ... You need a strong state and a \nstrong society, so the society can hold the \nstate accountable.

Russell \nFebruary 5, 2013 -- Shortly before he left \noffice in Feb. 2011, Defense Secretary \nRobert Gates told West Point cadets that \n\"in my opinion, any future defense \nsecretary who advised the president to \nagain send a big American land army into \nAsia or into the Middle East or Africa \nshould 'have his head examined,' as \nGeneral MacArthur so delicately put it.\" \nThe remark no doubt reflected Sec. \nGates's fatigue and frustration from the \nenormous intellectual and emotional \nburdens associated with overseeing the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nOne suspects, however, that in a more \nreflective moment, Gates would have \nacknowledged that \"never say never\" is a \nwise rule of thumb in planning for \nmilitary contingencies, especially in the \nregion that makes up Central Command's \narea-of-responsibility. Few, for example, \npredicted the 1979 Soviet invasion of \nAfghanistan. Gates himself -- who was a \nsenior CIA official during the covert war \nsupporting the Afghan resistance -- surely \ndid not anticipate then that the United \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029714 \nStates would have to return to \nAfghanistan two decades later to oust a \nTaliban regime that was harboring \nterrorists. Before 1990, moreover, no one \npredicted that Iraq, having just ended a \nbitter eight-year war with Iran, would \nswing its battered forces south to invade \nKuwait. \nSo if it's conventional wisdom that the \nUnited States will not, or should not, \nintervene militarily in the Middle East or \nSouth Asia after it draws down forces in \nIraq and Afghanistan, it's also likely dead \nwrong. What is true, however, is that \npolitical and military trajectories in the \nMiddle East and South Asia are likely to \nincreasingly challenge U.S. contingency \naccess in the coming decade. The ability \nfor the United States to surge large-scale \nforces into the region, as it did in the \n1990 and 2003 wars against Iraq, will \ngrow increasingly circumscribed. The \nUnited States will have to adapt to this \nnew strategic landscape by developing \nmore nimble, highly-mobile, stealthy, and \nnetworked forces, and by abandoning the \ntraditional practice of slowly and steadily \nbuilding up conventional forces at \nregional logistic hubs prior to launching \nwar. \n* * * \nPerhaps the most significant factor that \nportends against further intervention in \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029715 \nthe Middle East and South Asia is \nincreased political resistance -- and \noutright opposition -- from the countries \nin the region. That resistance is likely to \ncome from the new regimes emerging \nfrom the Arab uprisings, as well as a \nnumber of Gulf monarchies. \nIndeed, the political trends in the region \nare unlikely to conform to the rosy \npredictions of democratic peace theorists, \nwhose musings have implicitly informed \nthe security policies of both Republican \nand Democratic administrations for \ndecades. Old authoritarian regimes seem \nto be passing the way of the dodo bird, \nbut the new regimes taking shape are \nheavily influenced by militant Islamic \nideology that will make them less likely \nto engage in security or military \ncooperation with the United States. \nDemocracy optimists argue that these \nideological regimes, once entrenched in \npower, will have to moderate their zeal in \norder to govern. Pragmatism will \nultimately trump ideology. That line of \nreasoning, however, is based on the \nassumption that the policy decisions of \nsuch regimes can be explained by rational \nchoice economic theory. In other words, \nif they want to attract international capital \nand participate in the world economy, \nthey are going to have to break with their \nideological affinities. But that reasoning \nignores a hard fact of international \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029716 \npolitics: that time and again, political and \nideological prerogatives trump economic \nrationality. It made little economic sense, \nfor example, for Pakistan to pursue a \nnuclear weapons program in the 1970s, \njust as it makes little economic sense for \nIran to do so today. Clearly, both \nPakistan and Iran made major policy \ndecisions based on political-military \npriorities rather than economic \ncalculations. \nAs for the surviving monarchies in the \nMiddle East, they too will likely be less \naccommodating to American military \nforces than they have been in the past. To \nbe sure, much of the Arab support for \npast American military operations -- like \nboth Iraq wars -- was hidden from the \npublic eye. Arab states often loudly and \npublicly denounced \"unilateral \nAmerican\" military action in the region at \nthe same time as they supported it in \nbackroom dealings, quietly authorizing \nfacilities support and air, land, and sea \naccess. \nBut if Arab Gulf states were quietly \nsupportive in the past, their opposition to \nAmerican military force is likely to grow \nin the future. They read the aftermath of \nthe Arab uprisings much differently than \ndid American and European \npolicymakers. The Gulf monarchies were \nshocked that the United States \n\"abandoned\" Egyptian President Hosni \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029717 \nMubarak in his time of need in early \n2011. Their leaders expected the United \nStates to push for Mubarak and the \nEgyptian military to crack down on \npublic protests in Cairo. After all, \nAmerican policymakers during the Carter \nadministration had at least given this \npolicy option consideration during the \nIranian revolution in 1979. \nAlready, several Gulf states have begun \nto translate their displeasure into policy \nindependence from Washington. In 2011, \nfor example, a coalition of Gulf states led \nby Saudi Arabia intervened in Bahrain to \nquell domestic unrest in the island \ncountry. They did so under the banner of \nthe Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), \nwhich for years had been a feckless \nmilitary force. Largely unnoticed in \nWestern commentary was that the GCC, \nfor the first time in its history, mounted a \nrelatively effective military intervention. \nBahrain today is for all intents and \npurposes a province of Saudi Arabia, \neven if it is not polite to say so in \ndiplomatic circles. Since the Iranian \nrevolution, Bahrain -- like the United \nArab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar \n-- has pursued close ties with the United \nStates, in significant measure to \ncounterbalance Iran and Saudi Arabia. \nWith Washington at their back, they were \nable to stake out security policies that \nwere at least nominally independent from \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029718 \nSaudi Arabia. When Saudi Arabia wanted \nAmerican forces removed from the \nkingdom, for example, Qatar was eager \nto compensate by hosting a more robust \nAmerican command presence in the \nregion. \nThe Arab uprisings and subsequent GCC \nintervention in Bahrain have turned the \ntables, making Saudi security backing a \nnecessity for the smaller Gulf \nmonarchies. From their perspective, \nAmerican forces are clearly more capable \nthan Saudi forces, but given the \nalignment of their interests, Riyadh is a \nmore reliable security partner. Gulf \nleaders and military commanders in the \ncoming decade will be focused on how to \navoid following in Mubarak's footsteps. \nPart of minimizing that risk will involve \ndecreasing security dependency on the \nUnited States. Gulf leaders have to worry \nthat if push comes to shove, the \nAmericans will throw them under a bus \njust like they did to Mubarak. \n* * * \nIf the political dynamics in the Middle \nEast and South Asia do not favor further \nAmerican military intervention in the \nfuture, neither do the emerging military \ntrends. The proliferation of supersonic \ncruise missiles and mines in the region \nwill make for nasty forced entries into \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029719 \nnarrow maritime confines like the Suez \nCanal, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf \nBut the likely proliferation of nuclear \nweapons -- and ballistic missile delivery \nsystems -- will pose even more \nformidable challenges to conventional \nmilitary surges in the region. In the \nfuture, the United States will not be able \nto take for granted unchallenged surges \nof naval, air, and ground forces into \nregional theaters via logistics hubs. These \nhubs -- like the American naval presence \nin Bahrain -- are large, readily \nidentifiable, and will be increasingly \nvulnerable to future targeting by nuclear \nweaponry. \nIran's nuclear weapons, assuming it gets \nthem, will pose a direct threat to \nAmerican military surge capabilities. \nAlthough American policymakers and \nmilitary commanders might feel \nconfident that they could surge forces \ninto the Gulf despite Iranian nuclear \nthreats because of the American nuclear \ndeterrent, Gulf security partners might be \nmore nervous and less willing to \ncooperate. As a result, they might not \ngrant access to U.S. air, naval, and \nground forces out of fear of angering \nIran. \nAmerican observers who doubt that Gulf \nstates would make such calculations \nshould recall how Kuwait responded in \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029720 \nthe lead-up to Iraq's invasion in 1990. \nWhen faced with a build-up of Iraqi \nforces along its border, Kuwait decided \nnot to mobilize its military out of fear \nthat the move would provoke Saddam \nHussein. The incentives for Gulf states to \nmake similar strategic calculations in the \nfuture will be greater when Iran has an \ninventory of nuclear weapons to match its \ngrowing ballistic missile capabilities. \nThe Gulf states, moreover, will likely \nreason that the U.S. capability to threaten \nor use force against a nuclear Iran will be \nsignificantly diminished. Even without \nnuclear weapons, Gulf states have seen, \nin their view, a long history of American \nreluctance to threaten or use force against \nIran. For example, the United States took \nno direct military action against Iran after \nit aided and abetted Hezbollah bombings \nagainst Americans in Lebanon in the \n1980s, after Iran supported the bombing \nof Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in \n1996, or even after Iran supported the \ndeadly campaign of improvised explosive \ndevices (IEDs) against U.S. troops in \nIraq. Gulf states will no doubt judge that \nif the United States was unable and \nunwilling to attack Tehran under these \ncircumstances, then it is certainly not \ngoing to attack Iran in the future, when it \nwill be able to retaliate with nuclear \nweapons. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029721 \nAmerican policymakers may counter that \nIran would never be foolish enough to \nthreaten or use nuclear weapons against \nthe United States, given its robust nuclear \ndeterrence posture. But the threat or use \nof nuclear weapons might not look so \nfoolish from Iran's perspective. One of \nthe great strategic lessons drawn from the \nlong history of conflict in the Middle East \nis this: Do not go to war without nuclear \nweapons, as Saddam Hussein did when \nhe invaded Kuwait. The corollary is: Do \nnot allow the United States to \nmethodically build-up forces in the Gulf \nprior to invading, as Saddam did both in \nthe run-up to the 1991 re-conquest of \nKuwait and in 2003, before the drive to \ntopple the regime in Baghdad. \nDrawing upon these lessons, Iran will \nlikely do everything in its power to deny \nthe United States the ability to surge \nconventional forces into the region -- and \nthat might include threatening to target \nU.S. forces with nuclear weapons. Iran \nmight accept the risk that preemptive use \nof nuclear weapons could bring on \nAmerican nuclear retaliation, because \nfailure to do so would mean certain \ndestruction for the regime. The United \nStates would be able to build-up \nconventional forces in the region and oust \nIran's leaders just as it did in Baghdad. \nThis line of strategic reasoning runs \ncounter to conventional wisdom in the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029722 \nWest, but we actually know little or \nnothing about what Iranian decision-\nmakers think about nuclear weapons or \ndeterrence theory. Since the Iranian \nrevolution in 1979, opportunities for the \nexchange of professional views between \nWestern and Iranian scholars, \npolicymakers, and military leaders on \nthese critically important issues have \nbeen extremely limited. Therefore, it's not \nunreasonable to assume that the Iranians, \nlike American policymakers in the early \nstages of developing their nuclear triad \ndoctrine, will think of nuclear weapons as \nmerely \"big artillery.\" Unfortunately, the \nUnited States and its security partners \nlack formal and informal exchanges with \nthe Iranians akin to the Cold War \ndiscussions and arms control negotiations \nbetween the Americans and Soviets, \nwhich allowed both parties to develop \nmutual understandings of the other's \nperception of nuclear weapons. These \nunderstandings were essential for crisis \nmanagement in the Cold War strategic \nrelationship after the Cuban missile \ncrisis. \nMeanwhile, the Gulf states, led by Saudi \nArabia, are likely to look for their own \nnuclear deterrents. Much like France \nwanted its own nuclear force de frappe \nduring the Cold War, the Gulf states will \nwant their own nuclear weapons to deter \nIran. Saudi Arabia and the smaller Gulf \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029723 \nstates will worry that the United States \nwould be deterred from coming to their \ndefense in future regional crises by Iran's \nnuclear weapons. \nSaudi Arabia and other Arab states are \nlikely to see nuclear weapons as a quick \nfix for all of their security woes. \nAlthough they have been on a shopping \nspree in the past decade, buying \nexpensive and sophisticated Western \nmilitary technology, they have had a \ntough time absorbing the new technology \nand fully utilizing and integrating \nweapons systems. To be sure, in a rough  \nnet assessment, Saudi Arabia and its \nallies in the Gulf have significantly \ngreater conventional capabilities than \nIran. But if Iran goes nuclear, they will \nwant to follow suit. \n* * * \nAmericans may be weary of conflict in \nthe Middle East and South Asia, but \nstrategic prudence demands that we \ncontemplate future military interventions \nin the Central Command theater. A scan \nof the horizon reveals that both political \nand military trends in the region pose \nformidable obstacles to conventional \nforce surges into the region. \nBut there is another wrinkle in this story \nthat U.S. policymakers must contend with \nas they plan for the future. As Gulf \nmonarchies seek to reduce their \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029724 \ndependence on American military power, \nthey will increasingly look to China for \nsecurity assurances. China does not have \na political agenda devoted to promoting \ndemocratization, and it maintains \npolitical and diplomatic ties with both \nArab states and Iran. China's military \nactivity in the region is modest but \nincreasing, as evidenced by its recent \npeacekeeping dispatches to the region \nand naval port visits in the Gulf Beijing \nis likely to send more naval forces to the \nGulf to increase its presence there and \nenhance its ability to protect the sea lanes \nwhich bring oil to China's thirsty \neconomy. China is keenly aware that the \nUnited States has naval supremacy in the \nGulf, but will be working to erode that \nstrategic edge in the future. \nFaced with these realities, there is a need \nfor new thinking and innovative \nconceptualizations of surges into \nCentcom's area of responsibility. Theater \ncampaign planners will have to think \nabout contingencies in which the United \nStates cannot slowly and methodically \nbuild up forces in the region and then \nkick off campaigns after most troops, \narms, and equipment are in place. Future \nU.S. force build-ups in the region will be \nfar too vulnerable to preemptive nuclear \nstrikes. As a result, planners will have to \ndevise campaign plans in which the \ninsertion of U.S. military forces begins \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029725 \nwith an immediate rolling and flowing \nstart. The United States will have to work \nfrom smaller troop footprints and be \nprepared to start fighting even as follow-\non-forces are on the way. Ideally, these \nforces would flow from multiple staging \npositions to reduce vulnerability to \nnuclear attack. The politics of the region, \nhowever, will work against securing a \nmultitude of staging areas from which to \ndeploy. \nThe region under the purview of \nCentcom has always been riddled with \npolitical violence that has posed \nformidable challenges to military \noperations. But in plotting a course over \nthe horizon, the political and military \nobstacles for American military surges \ninto the region are poised to grow even \nlarger. As a result, theater contingency \nplanners will have fewer good options for \nprojecting American military power into \nthe region -- and they'll have to do more \nwith the bad and the ugly. \nRichard L.

And since then \nthe United States, the European powers, \nRussia, and China, all sought to arrange \nanother round of negotiations, first in \nDecember and then in January. It now \nappears that Iran, which is about to enter \nits presidential election season, has \nfinally agreed to what will be the first \nround of negotiations with the P5+1 since \nthe last round in Moscow seven months \nago. On Tuesday, Tehran announced that \nit will join talks on February 26 in \nKazakhstan. \nThe negotiations will be a serious test for \nthe Obama administration and for John \nKerry, the new secretary of state. \nPrevious rounds have all faltered because \nneither side was willing to make \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029727 \nconcessions to the other, and so far there \nis little sign that the United States and the \nP5+1 have improved their offer to Iran \nvery much. As the talks were announced, \nthe Washington Post reported: \"The P5+1 \npowers have made only mild revisions to \na proposal that Iran flatly rejected last \nJune.\" Until now, the United States has \nbeen unwilling to acknowledge Iran's \nright to enrich uranium on its own soil \nand to suggest that some economic \nsanctions might be lifted as part of a deal, \nand Iran has refused to agree even to a \nlimited deal called \"stop, ship, and shut\" \n— involving the suspension of its \nenrichment to 20 percent purity, shipping \nits existing stockpiles of 20% uranium to \na third country for processing, and \nshutting down its underground facility at \nFordo, near Qom — without an agreement \nto lift sanctions. \nAfter the reelection of Barack Obama in \nNovember, there were great hopes that \nthe president would have greater political \nfreedom of offer concessions to Iran. Yet, \npublicly at least, the White House isn't \nsignaling that it is ready to make a more \ngenerous offer to Iran, and in fact Obama \nin January signed into law yet another \nround of draconian economic sanctions. \nPerhaps as a result, Iran allegedly \ndragged its feet on setting a date for talks. \nDespite prodding from the P5+1 — \nincluding urgent efforts by Russia — in \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029728 \nJanuary Iran reportedly went silent about  \ntalks. Russia, increasingly frustrated by \nthe inability of Tehran and the West to \nnegotiate seriously, vented its frustration. \n\"Some of our partners in the six powers \nand the Iranian side cannot come to an \nagreement about where to meet,\" Russian \nForeign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a  \nnews conference. \"We are ready to meet \nat any location as soon as possible. We \nbelieve the essence of our talks is far \nmore important (than the site), and we \nhope that common sense will prevail and \nwe will stop behaving like little \nchildren.\" \nAccording to analysts in Washington, \nreinforced by comments from Iran itself, \na big reason for Tehran's recalcitrance is \nthat Iran wants to prove to the United \nStates that its vaunted sanctions regime \nwill not force Iran to make unilateral \nconcessions at the bargaining table. In \naddition, Iran is concerned that it won't \nget much in return in talks with the West, \nand that it will be asked to make \nunilateral concessions on uranium \nenrichment without getting sanctions \nrelief in return. Combined with Iranian  \ninternal divisions, as its own presidential  \nelection season gets underway, that could \nmean that for the next six months or so \nAyatollah Ali Khamenei simply won't be \nready to talk seriously, despite scheduling \nthe Kazakhstan round. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029729 \nOthers suspect that Iran is waiting to see \nhow President Obama's new national \nsecurity team — with Kerry as secretary of \nstate, Chuck Hagel as secretary of \ndefense, and John Brennan at the Central \nIntelligence Agency — will shape \nObama's stance at any talks. \nIn Washington, some would argue there's \na growing consensus, at the level of think \ntanks, Iran experts, and other analysts, \nthat a preliminary, first-round deal, \nincluding \"shop, ship, and shut,\" might \nwork, if in response the P5+1 could lift \nsome of the economic sanctions on Iran \nand agree to limited Iranian enrichment. \nPerhaps the best-case scenario is the \npossibility that there are ongoing, secret \nand back-channel talks between \nWashington and Tehran. Nothing along \nthose lines has leaked and there is no \nindication of this, yet. But in advance of \nthe first round of Iran-P5+1 talks in \nVienna in 2009, the United States and \nIran did indeed engage in quiet, behind-\nthe-scenes diplomacy. \nIn fact, of course, any sanctions relief for \nIran will occur slowly and step-by-step, \nnot all at once, in parallel with steps \ntaken by Iran and openness to more \nintrusive inspections and oversight by the \nIAEA. \nBut it's certainly not helpful that in early \nJanuary yet another round of unilateral \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029730 \nsanctions was passed by Congress and \nsigned into law by President Obama. The \ncomplex set of new measures targets key \nindustrial sectors, including shipping and \nimports of products such as aluminum, \nsteel and coal, and seeks to block Iran \nfrom using barter commodities such as \noil and gold to pay for imports. The \nWashington Post paraphrased U.S. \nofficials as saying that, \"the new policies \nare closer to a true trade embargo, \ndesigned to systematically attack and \nundercut Iran's major financial pillars \nand threaten the country with economic \ncollapse.\" Obama signed the National \nDefense Authorization Act (NDAA) that \ncontained the sanctions provisions \ndespite having hinted earlier that he \nmight veto the NDAA over a host of \nmeasures contained in the bill. \nIf the Obama administration believes that \never-tougher sanctions will cause Iran to \ncave in at the talks, it's likely that they \nare badly misreading Iranian politics. \nFor many observers, however, and for \nIran, too, the nomination of Hagel for \nsecretary of defense may be a sign that \nthe White House is beginning to realize \nthat sanctions, and threats of military \naction, won't force Iran's hand. \nAs has been widely reported, hawks, \nneoconservatives, and members of the \npro-Israel lobby in Washington have \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029731 \nslammed Hagel for his past comments \nand positions on Iran. In conjunction with \nIsrael-friendly members of Congress, \nthey've warned Obama to rein Hagel in \nso as not to send a dovish signal to \nTehran. Robert Satloff, executive \ndirection of the Washington Institute for \nNear East Policy (WINEP), a pro-Israel \nthink tank, warned bluntly that the White \nHouse should act quickly to make sure \nthat Hagel backs away from his previous \nviews on Iran and at least toes the \nadministration's tougher line. \"If the \nWhite House does not take steps soon to \ncorrect that impression, the chances for a \nnegotiated resolution of the Iran nuclear \ncrisis will fall nearly to zero and the \nlikelihood of Israeli military action will \nrise dramatically,\" he wrote. \nIndeed, within days of his nomination as \nsecretary of defense, Hagel was already \nbacking away from his earlier views, \nmeeting with senior Pentagon officials \nand influential senators who'll vote on \nhis confirmation to clarify his views on \nIran, asserting that he supports broad \ninternational sanctions against Iran and \nthat he believes that the military option \nought to be \"on the table.\" Several \nDemocratic senators who met with Hagel \nannounced with satisfaction that the \nformer senator from Nebraska had \nsufficiently backtracked or \"clarified\" his \nviews on Iran. Consequently, they \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029732 \nannounced that he had earned their \nsupport — and their vote. \nThen, during his confirmation hearings \non January 31, Hagel — under hostile \nquestioning from several Republican \nsenators — backed away from earlier-held \npositions on Iran, including the role of \nsanctions. And, though he previously \nbeen a sharp critic of a military attack on \nIran, in his opening statement Hagel said: \n\"I am fully committed to the President's \ngoal of preventing Iran from obtaining a \nnuclear weapon, and—as I've said in the \npast—all options must be on the table to \nachieve that goal. My policy is one of \nprevention, and not one of containment—\nand the President has made clear that is \nthe policy of our government. As \nSecretary of Defense, I will make sure \nthe Department is prepared for any \ncontingency.\" \nSatloff's views were echoed by another \ntough-talking official at WINEP, former \nAmbassador Dennis Ross, a pro-Israel \nhawk who served as Obama's top adviser \non Iran during much of the president's \nfirst term. \"I think 2013 is going to be \ndecisive,\" Ross told the Los Angeles  \nTimes, expressing concern about Hagel's \nprevious comments. \"Time really is \nrunning out. For diplomacy to have a \nchance of success, the Iranians need to \nunderstand that if diplomacy fails, force \nis going to be the result. We still have a \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029733 \nchallenge to convince the Iranians that \nwe're quite serious about the use of \nforce,\" he said. \"In the first term, the \nadministration didn't always speak with \none voice on this issue. So what Hagel \nsays can make a difference.\" \nDespite his poorly receieved performance  \nat his confirmation hearings, it's widely \nbelieved in Washington that Hagel will \nbe confirmed as secretary of defense and \nthat his private advice to Obama will \nmore closely hew to his long-held beliefs \nabout the futility of sanctions and the \ngrave downside to a military strike. Partly \nfor that reason, it remains very unlikely \nthat the Obama administration will resort \nto force to resolve the dispute with Iran. \nIn fact, in remarks that Iranian officials \ncited as promising, Vice President Joe \nBiden expressed the administration's \nwillingness to hold bilateral talks with the \nIranians. In response to a question at the \nMunich Security Conference Biden said, \n\"We have made it clear at the outset \nthat...we would be prepared to meet \nbilaterally with the Iranian leadership\" \nwhen Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah \nAli Khamenei is serious about \nnegotiations. Iran's Foreign Minister, Ali \nAkbar Salehi responded favorably and \nsaid, \"I am optimistic, I feel this new \nadministration is really seeking this time \nto at least divert from its previous \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029734 \ntraditional approach vis-a-vis my \ncountry.\" \nBut if Washington remains committed to \never-tougher sanctions — and without \npromising Iran that sanctions will be \nlifted as part of a deal — then negotiations \nare unlikely to succeed. Vali Nasr, \nanother former Obama administration \nofficial with expertise on Iran, suggested \nrecently that there's not much more the \nworld can do to sanction Iran, and that \nsuch penalties could drive Tehran to take \nradical action. The regime of sanctions \nagainst Iran over its nuclear activity \n\"really has reached its end,\" Nasr, dean of \nthe Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced \nInternational Studies at Johns Hopkins \nUniversity, said during the World \nEconomic Forum in Davos. And he \nwarned that unless there is a diplomatic \nbreakthrough — or, alternatively, an \nattack on Iran — \"you really are looking \nat a scenario where Iran is going to rush \nvery quickly towards nuclear power, \nbecause they also think, like North \nKorea, that (then) you have much more \nleverage to get rid of these sanctions.\" \nRobert Dreyfuss is an independent, \ninvestigative journalist in the \nWashington, D.

Zoellick \nFebruary 5, 2013 -- Five years into the \nglobal economic storm, America's \ntraditional allies, theEuropean Union and \nJapan, are struggling. Developing \neconomies are reshaping the global \ndynamic but also face big challenges. The \nUnited States is the one country that \ncould lead the modernization of the \ninternational system so as to supply \nsecurity, economic opportunity, and \nprospects for liberty. America's own \nstrategy for economic revival cannot be \nlimited to the nation's borders. And its \nfuture foreign policy—its projection of \npower and principle—must be grounded \nin the emerging economic order. \nPresident Obama has said he admires \nRonald Reagan's transformative thinking. \nIf so, he should ask for an assessment of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029736 \nReagan's second-term innovations on \ncurrency and monetary affairs, trade, debt \nand development. Reagan advanced a \nnew international system to match the \nrevival of capitalism after the oil shocks \nand stagflation of the 1970s. America's \nsuccess in the 1980s contributed both to \nthe end of the Cold War, by persuading \nthe Soviet Union it could not keep up, \nand to two decades of exceptional global \ngrowth. \nThe new U.S. international economic \nstrategy should have five parts. First, this \ncountry should strengthen its continental \nbase by building on the North American \nFree Trade Agreement with Canada and \nMexico. Together, the three partners \ncould boost energy security, improve \nproductivity, and give North Americans \nan edge in manufacturing and other \nindustries that are already experiencing \nrising wages in East Asia. A politically \nacceptable immigration policy, and a \npush for educational innovation using \nnew technologies and competition, could \nlead to a more prosperous, populous, \nintegrated and democratic future for the \nhemisphere. \nSecond, the extraordinary monetary \npolicies of late, led by the Federal \nReserve's continued near-zero interest-\nrate policy, are taking us into uncharted \nterritory. Central banks have tried most \nevery tool to stimulate growth; if Japan is \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029737 \nany warning, the next tactic is \ncompetitive devaluation, which risks a \nnew protectionism. \"Currency \nmanipulation\" could become a danger \nthat reaches far beyond the debate about \nChinese policies. The world economy \nwill need at some point to withdraw the \ndrug of cheap money and negative real \ninterest rates. The U.S. should anticipate \nthese dangers. \nThe International Monetary Fund also \ncould help set standards about exchange-\nrate policies and serve as a referee that \nblows a whistle, even if it cannot \npenalize. The IMF and the World Trade \nOrganization should anticipate this risk \nand give effect to the existing WTO \nagreement that economies must \"avoid \nmanipulating exchange rates . . . to gain \nan unfair competitive advantage.\" \nThird, the U.S. needs to break the logjam \non opening markets. As the leading world \neconomy, America should initially try to \nstrengthen and increase international \ntrade through the WTO. As my \ncolleagues at the Peterson Institute have \npointed out, there are gains from the \nstymied Doha Round of trade \nnegotiations that should be harvested \nnow: ending agricultural export \nsubsidies; limiting food export controls; \neliminating tariffs and quotas for almost \nall exports of the poorest countries; \nfacilitating customs and clearance \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029738 \nprocedures; and improving the \ntransparency and speed of the system for \nsettling disputes. \nNext, the U.S. needs to keep the WTO \ncurrent with a vastly changed world \neconomy. The past WTO agreements are \nvaluable for all 158 WTO members. But \nsome economies want to go further by \nreducing barriers in important sectors \nsuch as the services trade, environmental \ngoods and services, government \nprocurement, and the digital economy. \nThe services trade, for example, is vital \nfor boosting innovation, productivity and \njobs in developing and developed \ncountries alike—but regulatory, \nlicensing, zoning and other barriers to \nservices are often equivalent to a 30% \ntariff or higher. Because liberalization in \nthe WTO has been stuck, countries have \nturned increasingly to bilateral and \nmultilateral free-trade agreements, some \nof which have addressed these newer \ntopics. The U.S. should foster the WTO \nprinciple of world-wide liberalization by \nadopting standards in various industries \nand sectors that would be open to all \neconomies that reciprocate. The WTO \nalso needs new rules for fair trading by \nstate-owned enterprises. \nYet the U.S. also should use free-trade \nagreements to open markets. Trade \ncompetition advances structural reforms \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029739 \nand growth without bigger government \nand more spending. The Obama \nadministration has talked about trans-\nPacific and trans-Atlantic accords. Yet it \nhas failed to close even one new free-\ntrade agreement. Ron Kirk, the \npresident's trade representative, said in \n2009 that the administration did not have \n\"deal fever.\" In fact, it has been \"deal \ndelinquent.\" \nFourth, gender equality is not only fair \nand right—it is smart economics. No \neconomy can reach its potential if it \noverlooks the talents of half its people. \nThe U.S. should lead in identifying \nstructural barriers in countries that hold \nback girls' and women's health, \neducation, credit, jobs and \nentrepreneurship. \nFinally, the U.S. needs to match growth \npriorities of developing economies. \nPresident Obama should expand the \nglobal food-security initiative he \nannounced in 2009 to boost agricultural \nproductivity and production across the \nvalue chain, including through the private \nsector, in sub-Saharan Africa and other \npoor regions. Infrastructure investment \ncould increase global demand today \nwhile building productivity for tomorrow. \nThe U.S. can lead a push with middle-\nincome economies to develop public-\nprivate infrastructure models that move \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029740 \nfrom \"one-offs\" to a deal flow. The zero \nreturns for savers from U.S. monetary \npolicy can make infrastructure \ninvestments attractive. \nIn addition to offering financing, the \nprivate sector can improve the design, \noperation and maintenance of \ninfrastructure. As the state of Indiana has \nshown, the federal government could \nprofitably use public-private partnerships \nfor its infrastructure, too. \nThe administration has talked about some \nof these topics. But it is oddly passive, as \nif it were hesitant to lead. State \nDepartment speeches are not enough. To \ncarve out an international economic \nstrategy, the new secretary of the \nTreasury needs to choreograph policies \nacross all U.S. departments and with \nmultilateral economic institutions. The \nU.S. had better wake up: International \neconomic strategy is the new foreign \npolicy. \nMr. Zoellick has served as president of \nthe World Bank Group, U.S. trade \nrepresentative and deputy secretary of \nstate. He is now a fellow at the Belfer \nCenter at Harvard and the Peterson \nInstitute for International Economics. \nClick here to Reply or Forward \nWhy this ad?Ads — \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029741 \nTeach English Worldwide  \nBecome an English Teacher Overseas Earn Your TESOL \nOnline at USC. \nrossieronline.usc.edu \n22.3 GB (10%) of 210.1 GBManage  \n©2013 Google - Terms & Privacy \nLast account activity: 0 minutes ago \nDetails \nTeach English Worldwide \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

If we\nassume that I can get something great from sexual relationships without Being On The\nPath To Marriage. That I understand and honor my sexual desires, that those desires are\nworth fulfilling in themselves. And if we assume that men have something wonderful\nthey could bring to the sexual exchange; that they aren't always \"using\" or \"exploiting\" or\n\"winning\" some kind of sick war-of-the-sexes, every single time they fuck.\n\nBut even if the fears don't make sense, sometimes they still come out and whisper at the\nback of my neck... /'m selling myself short. As if I should have bargained better, should\nhave traded my sexuality for far more than \"mere\" pleasure with someone I \"merely\"\nliked, was \"merely\" attracted to, who \"merely\" respected my boundaries and \"merely\"\nwas fun to hang out with. Would some people see it as ironic that I prefer relationships\nwith real emotional heft, even when short-term or casual? Even with that said, though,\nthere is no description of how reasonable, safe, or awesome my relationships are that will\nmatter to our slut-shaming society -- or to the fears it's hammered into me. Society,\nwhose judgment of whether a girl is a \"slut\" can be sudden and devastating, stupid and\nstereotypical; a lightning strike that lands based on absurd factors like how non-\nnormative or straightforward or aware of her sexuality she is. And once I'm a \"slut\" -- if]\ndare dance over that ever-shifting line -- then I'm beyond the pale. The world always\nseems to be outdoing itself in finding new ways to tell me that once I'm a slut, no man\nwill ever respect me again.\n\nTK OK ok\n\nI went home. It was raining, all across my cypress city; raining so hard, I had to take the\nbus instead of walking. The rain struck me as an insultingly obvious metaphor, as did the\nfact that I was scheduled to attend a wedding that afternoon. It seemed strange that\nhallucinatory San Francisco would throw such tired tropes at me. (I should have trusted\nthe city more. It was with me, still.)\n\nI was sad. Not devastated. Just sad, and a little bit scared. /'m such a screwed-up\nperverted slut, no man will ever care about me. However, I'm an adult, so I tried to\nrecognize my emotional baggage, give myself some time to process, then eat a proper\nlunch and get some work done.\n\nI took a very dear, very blunt friend out to dinner recently. (Yes, I paid, and yes, he felt\nobjectified.) Over Indian curries, I tried to explain my fears that All Men (who are of\ncourse a monolith) will pigeonhole me as \"too much\", \"too extreme.\" A \"slut.\" Whatever.\nMy friend listened, savoring his delicious lassi as he thought about what I was trying to\nsay. Then he said, \"Look, you shouldn't worry about it. You're extreme. You're also tall.\nYou couldn't be un-tall for a man, and you can't be un-extreme. There are men who will\nlike you just fine for it, so just keep an eye out for those men.” I could detect the edge\nunder his words: Come on, Clarisse, you're the one who always says that People Are\nDifferent, why do I even have to tell you this?

Even without official confirmation of that source’s name, the news so\n\nfar holds some stunning implications.\n\nAmong them is that the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation outright hid critical\ninformation from a congressional investigation. In a Thursday press conference, Speaker Paul Ryan bluntly\nnoted that Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes’s request for details on this secret source was “wholly\n\n99 66\n\nappropriate,” “completely within the scope” of the committee’s long-running FBI investigation, and\n“something that probably should have been answered a while ago.” Translation: The department knew full\nwell it should have turned this material over to congressional investigators last year, but instead deliberately\n\nconcealed it.\n\nHouse investigators nonetheless sniffed out a name, and Mr. Nunes in recent weeks issued a letter and a\nsubpoena demanding more details. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s response was to double\ndown—accusing the House of “extortion” and delivering a speech in which he claimed that “declining to\nopen the FBI’s files to review” is a constitutional “duty.” Justice asked the White House to back its\nstonewall. And it even began spinning that daddy of all superspook arguments—that revealing any detail\n\nabout this particular asset could result in “loss of human lives.”\n\nThis is desperation, and it strongly suggests that whatever is in these files is going to prove very\n\nuncomfortable to the FBI.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021110\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Given its support for Hizbollah, and\nits serial diatribes about destroying the State of Israel, this was hardly a surprise.\nBut it was a gesture nonetheless, and I told him I appreciated it. I also arrived with\na gift: a leather-bound volume with both the Hebrew Bible and Koran. I began our\nmeeting with what I felt I most needed him to hear: that both of us were trying to\nachieve something hugely important, nothing less than a new relationship between\nIsraelis and Palestinians based on trust. As I would discover in the months ahead —\nas Yitzhak had found as well — Arafat responded warmly to such general appeals\nof principle. He replied that he viewed me as a partner, and a friend. But the key\nissue of substance — the difference between how I envisaged taking Oslo forward\nand what he wanted — was impossible to avoid.\n\nI emphasized that I was committed to the further Wye River summit\nredeployments Bibi which had agreed, although not implemented, as well as to a\nrelease of Palestinian prisoners agreed at Wye. Yet then came the more difficult\npart: explaining my view of how we could best move toward a full peace\nagreement.

But he held\nfirm in his opposition to any further delay in the Wye redeployments. More\nworryingly for the longer-term prospects of an agreement, he ignored altogether\nmy suggestion that we move ahead toward the permanent-status talks.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, I was careful to accentuate the positive. I said the reason\nI’d come to see Arafat so soon was because of the importance I attached to his role\nin “shaping peace in the Middle East.” I said I would not waver in continuing on\nthe path which Rabin and he and begun.

He was soon recaptured, sentenced to life imprisonment and soon\nbegan to plan his next escape—this time across the border to Mexico, which was only a two hour\ndrive from the prison.\n\nBefore he could escape, Gary had to get himself removed from the “escape risk” list and\nmaximum security—to establish a sense of trust in him by the prison officials. When some young\nprisoners acted up, Gary worked with the prison officials and helped to control them. He worked\non the newspaper, television, and entertainment committee, earning him the right to have visits\nwith his family in the outdoor recreation area. Gary used his time with his family to persuade\nthem to help him escape. After much prodding, the boys agreed.\n\nOn a summer visiting day in July of 1978, the three Tison brothers arrived at the Florence State\nPrison with their perennial picnic basket. Beneath the fried chicken were pistols and shotguns.\n\nThe boys had arranged for a car to be parked in the lot of the local hospital. They knew there\ncould be shooting. But Gary promised them that nobody would get hurt. “The more firepower\nyou have,” he instructed them, “the less likely you’ll have to use it.”\n\n“We told Dad,” Raymond later said, “we’ll do this on one condition—that no one gets hurt.”\n\nGary assured the boys, “We'll make it out without firing a shot or being fired at. And once\noutside, it will be clear sailing. I know how it works. I’ve been there before.” He had been there\nbefore, but it hadn’t worked. He had killed a guard and been recaptured.\n\nTo the three boys, their father wasn’t a killer. A guard had been accidentally shot in a scuffle. It\nwas not in cold blood. Their father was incapable of that. Gary told them that his criminal\nconduct had been a result of secret training he had received in the “Service.” It was “top secret.”\nThey believed this fantasy like they believed everything else their father told them. “Nobody was\ngoing to get shot,” their father assured them.\n\nGary’s prediction proved to be correct about the escape. Raymond went to meet his father in the\npicnic area. His brothers Ricky and Donny went into the waiting room with their picnic basket.\nA friend of Gary’s, Randy Greenawalt—also a convicted murderer—was in an adjoining control\nroom. When the other visitors had left, the boys pulled out their shotguns and held the guards at\nbay. Raymond and Gary joined them.\n\nWhen additional guards appeared they were first ordered to lie down and then herded into a\nstorage room. The door was locked and the power turned off. Then the five simply walked out\nthe front door.

I describe the Control Factor as an “active and\ncontinuous process” designed to maintain that sense, if not illusion, of control. We natural ly think that our\nthinking and feeling processes are passive; that they just happen. Yet when faced with truly frightening\nprospects, the mind is geared to actively distort.\n\nSimilarly, the sense of control must be continuously maintained so the Control Factor operates constantly. In\nturn, the sum of this active and continuous undertaking makes these perceptions all the more familiar and\nthus seemingly all the more “real.” In one sense, the Control Factor is the mechanism of what Andy\nMcCarthy entitled one of his numerous excellent books- willful blindness. The Control Factor is cleverer\nthan we are aware; that is almost tautological as, if our minds are to create ways to keep us in denial, they\nmust out maneuver our conscious thinking.\n\nSince World War II, America has had limited experience with threats coming to the homeland. Most of\nAmerica’s history has been about “over there,” where we have always known that if things got too out of\nhand (e.g. Vietnam) we could always ret urn home. The current generations, for a wide array of reasons,\nhave had virtually no experience with a threat to this land. (The documentary, Generation Zero, is interesting\non this point).\n\nConsequently, the process of waking up to such a threat parallels the arc of a typical horror film. In such a\nfilm, there is typically a cast of characters surrounding one or two main characters. We in the audience know\nthere is a threat coming — be it a monster, a virus, a psycho killer, an alien, the blob that ate Cincinnati etc.\nThis threat is typically defined by its intent- the singular goal of destroying the characters. Much of the initial\nexposition shows how the characters first are oblivious to the destruction the threat brings about, then explain\nit in familiar terms only to finally open their eyes to see that something uniquely terrifying is happening. The\nnext stage usually involves a series of failed attempts to deal with the threat- fr om trying to negotiate with it,\nto appease it, to coax it, to threaten it with ineffective weapons and so forth. Most of these failings are due to\nnot adequately appreciating the threat for what it truly is and projecting onto it a host of other attributes\ninstead. The final stage generally involves a back-up-against-the-wall decision by whichever characters\nremain alive. I named this the “turnaround moment” when the character becomes willing to be as ruthless as\nthe threat. That change in mental state is necessary to ensure survival. Ultimately, the storyline is a race for\nwhichever characters remain to wake up fully and use whatever advantages they may still have to beat the\nthreat.\n\nThis is the same arc our minds go through in battling our own Control Factors, our own compulsions to deny\nthat which is staring us in the face. Ultimately, the question is whether we will be able to wake up while we\nstill have advantages and give ourselves permis sion to fully fight the battle we are in.\n\nI said ear lier that there is a structure to the Control Factor. To oversimplify, I view it much as a pyramid\nwhere on the bottom are the many minute by minute thoughts that are manipulated. I call this level of\nmaneuvers the many ”D’s” as they include the psychological defenses such as distortion, denial,\ndemonization, deflection, deletion, detachment, delusion, displacement, discolorization and so forth. Layered\nupon these are moves such as projection, where we can assign to our Islamic Enemy traits we wish to see in\nthem or introject traits from them into ourselves that we wish not to acknowledge. These maneuvers involve\na mixing of identities where we actually lose clarity about who we are and who the enemy is. Projection and\nintrojection are active almost across the board. It is always helpful, for instance, to ask how what the enemy\naccuses us of is more appropriately descriptive of it. When we add Western Guilt and Shame, our need to be\nliked, and o ther psychological dimensions, basic thoughts solidify into larger fantasies.\n\nAs these narratives (“Our courts will never allow that,” “As a superpower we will always be able to win any\nfight we put our minds to,” “Assimilation will ensure Muslims are westernized” ...) gain consent from others\nthey tend to guide us deeply and become infused on our policies. Ultimately, what emerges is a relationship\nwe take with our Islamic Enemy that parallels that between an addict and an enabler. Emblematic of this\nrelationship is the “transfer of responsibility” in which we assume responsibility for the enemy’s behavior\nwho is addicted to transferring it away from itself. The Control Factor actively maintains this relationship\nand makes changing that relationship as difficult a chore as any addict finds in breaking his addiction.

Once again Mavericks games had\na party atmosphere as Reunion Arena rocked with the\nreturn of the “Reunion Rowdies.” Mavericks games\nbecame more than just ordinary NBA games—\n\nthey were a total entertainment experience.\n\nCuban was not only successful at instilling a sense\nof pride and passion into Mavericks fans by presenting himself\nas the ultimate role model by cheering from the same seats he\nhad in years past, but he also became the first owner in team\nsports to encourage fan interaction through e-mail on his\npersonal computer. It was through this personal touch that\nfans throughout the Metroplex, and around the world, began\nto notice Cuban’s energetic personality and take notice of\nthe Mavericks. He has personally responded to thousands\nof emails, and several suggestions from fans have led to\ninnovative changes such as a new three-sided shot clock,\nwhich allows line of site to the 24-second clock from\nanywhere in the arena.\n\nCuban’s whatever-it-takes attitude and commitment\nto winning has everyone’s attention. From his first introduction\nto the team to the end of his first season as owner, the players\nresponded with a 31-19 record, including a 9-1 mark in April\n2000. In addition to hiring special coaches for offense,\ndefense and shooting, Cuban has promised to do everything\nin his power to improve the team. This goal was achieved as\nthe club finished the 2000-01 season with a 53-29 record en\nroute to their first playoff appearance in 11 years where they\nbecame just the sixth team in NBA history to be down o-2 and\ncome back to win a five-game series vs. Utah in Round 1.\n\nBefore the start of the 2001-02 season, American\nAirlines Center, the Mavs new home, opened and Cuban\nco-founded HDNet, an all high-definition television network\non DIRECTV channel 199 which launched in September\n2001. As with his other ventures, Cuban is revolutionizing\nthe television industry with HDNet. He is planning to expand\nHDNet to include three more networks showing high-def\nsports, movies and entertainment by the end of 2002.\n\nDuring the Mavs 2001-02 campaign, the team\ncontinued their winning ways by finishing the season with\na franchise-best record of 57-25 and an NBA-best road\nrecord of 27-14, advancing to the postseason for the\nsecond-consecutive year.\n\nPrior to his purchase of the Mavericks, Cuban co-\nfounded Broadcast.com, the leading provider of multimedia\nand streaming on the Internet, in 1995, selling it to Yahoo!\nin July of 1999. Before Broadcast.com, Cuban co-founded\nMicroSolutions, a leading National Systems Integrator,\nin 1983, and later sold it to CompuServe.\n\nToday, in addition to his ownership of the Mavericks,\nCuban is an active investor in leading and cutting-edge\ntechnologies and continues to be a sought-after speaker.\n\nMARK CUBAN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017535\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I have been informed by Producer James Hill that ABC\nintends to air an interview, conducted by a Good Morning America co-host, of a woman known\nin court papers as Jane Doe 3.’ I write to put you on notice that ABC’s publication of Jane Doe\n3’s accusations is grossly negligent or worse. The accusations, many of which relate to my\nclient, relate to alleged conduct that occurred approximately 15 years ago. The current\naccusations are simply reformatted and embellished echoes of previous allegations, which were\nfirst made by Jane Doe 3 to tabloid publications in the United Kingdom in 2011 and which have\nno independent news value. These allegations were then and remain now uncorroborated and\nhave been refuted or undermined by other, credible evidence. Indeed, a federal judge recently\nrefused to consider these allegations in pending litigation, finding them “immaterial and\nimpertinent”, while striking the allegations and denying Jane Doe 3s Motion to Join, See Jane\nDoe 1 and 2 v. United States, 08-CV-80736-KAM (S.D. Fla.), Dkt 324 at 5. In addition, in that\nvery same litigation, Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Timothy R. Slater filed a\ndeclaration stating that when Jane Doe 3 was interviewed by the FBI in 2007 she refused to\ncooperate with the investigation of Mr. Epstein declaring she wanted nothing to do with the\nmatter. For ABC to air these untested allegations on national television as “news” when Jane\nDoe 3 intentionally declined eight years ago to subject these same allegations to verification by\nthe FBI would be grossly irresponsible and severely damaging to Mr. Epstein and others.\n\n\"Mr. Hill informed me that she was waiving whatever rights to anonymity she might assert but I will, because of\ncertain legal obligations, refer to her as Jane Doe 3.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028928\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

A mumber of\nresearchers [Bic88, Arl75, CRK82, Rie73, Mar01| have described one or more postformal stages.\nCommons and colleagues have also proposed a task-based model which provides a framework for\nexplaining stage discrepancies across tasks and for generating new stages based on classification\nof observed logical behaviors. [K1<90] promotes a statistical conception of stage, which provides a\ngood bridge between task-based and stage-based models of development, as statistical modeling\nallows for stages to be roughly defined and analyzed based on collections of task behaviors.\n\n[CRK&82] postulates the existence of a postformal stage by observing elevated levels of abstrac-\ntion which, they argue, are not manifested in formal thought. [CTS~ 98] observes a postformal\nstage when subjects become capable of analyzing and coordinating complex logical systems\nwith each other, creating metatheoretical supersystems. In our model, with the reflexive stage\nof development, we expand this definition of metasystemic thinking to include the ability to\nconsciously refine one’s own mental states and formalisms of thinking. Such self-reflexive re-\nfinement is necessary for learning which would allow a mind to analytically devise entirely new\nstructures and methodologies for both formal and postformal thinking.\n\nIn spite of these various critiques and limitations, however, we have found Piaget’s ideas\nvery useful, and in Section 11.4 we will explore ways of defining them rigorously in the specific\ncontext of CogPrime’s declarative knowledge store and probabilistic logic engine.\n\n11.3.1 Perry’s Stages\n\nAlso relevant is William Perry’s [Per70, Per81] theory of the stages (“positions” in his terminol-\nogy) of intellectual and ethical development, which constitutes a model of iterative refinement\nof approach in the developmental process of coming to intellectual and ethical maturity. These\nstages, depicted in Table 11.2 form an analytical tool for discerning the modality of belief of\nan intelligence by describing common cognitive approaches to handling the complexities of real\nworld ethical considerations.\n\n11.3.2 Keeping Continuity in Mind\n\nContinuity of mental stages, and the fact that a mind may appear to be in multiple stages\nof development simultaneously (depending upon the tasks being tested), are crucial to our\ntheoretical formulations and we will touch upon them again here. Piaget attempted to address\ncontinuity with the creation of transitional “half stages”. We prefer to observe that each stage\nfeeds into the other and the end of one stage and the beginning of the next blend together.\n\nThe distinction between formal and post-formal, for example, seems to “merely” be the\napplication of formal thought to oneself. However, the distinction between concrete and formal is\n“merely” the buildup to higher levels of complexity of the classification, task decomposition, and\nabstraction capabilities of the concrete stage. The stages represent general trends in ability on\na continuous curve of development, not discrete states of mind which are jumped-into quantum\nstyle after enough “knowledge energy” builds-up to cause the transition.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013108\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

To\nboot, his former girl friend, Ghislaine Maxwell the daughter of the\ndisgraced Robert Maxwell—encouraged at least one of the girls to come to\nEpstein’s home (and forever more has become a fixture of further weird\npossibilities in this tale).\n\nPalm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter is reported to say: “This is\nbigger than Rush Limbaugh,” who, in a storm of publicity, has just been\narrested in Palm Beach for possession of controlled drugs.\n\nOn one side are some of the nation’s most powerful defense attorneys\n(who, increasingly, seem more stumblebum than effective), on the other side,\na round-up of hapless girls, with sensational tales of perversion and infamy\n(in the telling they are not so much sex workers, as Dickensian victims),\nrelatively speaking giving the Palm Beach authorities the choice between\nutter capitulation to the powerful or standing on the side of the exploited and\npowerless.\n\nStill, with a critical eye, it also quite appears to be a straightforward\ntale of prostitution (however more or less kinky). And even though some of\nthe girls are minors, age is not a distinguishing factor in a prostitution charge\nin Florida, nor in most places (in New York, for instance, at this time\nsoliciting sex with anyone over the age of 14 is a class D misdemeanor\ncalling for a $100 fine).\n\nIn fact, Saige Gonzales told the police that she lied about being 18\nbecause otherwise she knew she would not have been admitted to the house.\n\nThe local sex crimes prosecutor, Lana Belhalevic, interviews the girls\nand determines that the offense is solely related to prostitution—that there\nare no innocent victims.\n\nDershowitz rejects a series of lower-level plea deals and Palm Beach\nDistrict Attorney Barry Krischer takes the unusual step of empanelling a\ngrand jury, which returns with a recommendation of a single count of\nsoliciting a prostitute—a charge without jail time. (And Epstein can apply to\nhave his record expunged after a year.)\n\nAt which point, Reiter, the police chief, at odds with the District\nAttorney’s office, recruits the involvement of the FBI. This is of course the\nBush-era FBI and Epstein presents quite the Clinton-connected scandal. Still,\nsolicitation, even of a minor, is not a federal crime.

At a September 2016\nBrookings Institution conference on productivity,\nMartin Feldstein, Harvard professor and president\nemeritus of the National Bureau of Economic\nResearch, also concluded that “the official statistics\nsubstantially underestimate the real growth\nof output” after studying the methods used to\nmeasure price indices.°°\n\nWe point to three examples to illustrate the\nmismeasurement argument. First, our colleagues in\nGoldman Sachs’ Global Investment Research (GIR)\nhave pointed out that the official price indices for\ninformation and communication technology show\nan implausible gap between the price deflation in\ncomputers and that in communications equipment,\nsoftware and other IT equipment (see Exhibit 14).\nThey question how “a given dollar outlay now\nbuys about 10 times as much computer in real\nterms as 20 years ago, but it only buys about 10%\nmore software.”\n\nOur colleagues’ conclusion that the\nofficial price indices for the information and\ncommunication technology sector are overstated\nmatches that of a 2015 study of microprocessor\npricing by David Byrne of the Federal Reserve\nBoard, Professor Stephen Oliner of UCLA, and\nSichel.** The trio created an index showing that\nprices for microprocessor units used in desktop\npersonal computers declined by an average\nannual rate of 43% between 2008 and 2013,\nwhile the official Producer Price Index (PPI)\nfor these units declined by an average annual\nrate of 8%—substantially mismeasuring the\nreal value created by this sector of information\ntechnology equipment. They point out that\nbecause microprocessor units represent about half\nof US shipments of semiconductors, the rate of\ninnovation in this sector is inevitably mismeasured.\n\nA second example of mismeasurement that we\ncan all readily appreciate involves the quality and\nproduct improvements in smartphones. Hal Varian,\nchief economist at Google and emeritus professor\nat the University of California at Berkeley, has\nestimated that globally, people took over 1.6\ntrillion photos in 2015 using their smartphones,\ncompared with 80 billion in 2000 using cameras\nand film. The price of each photo taken has gone\n\nExhibit 14: US Technology Price Indices\nThe implausible gap with hardware suggests IT and\ncommunication price indices are likely overstated.\n\nQ1 1995 = 100\n140\n\nSoftware\n----- Hardware (Computers and Peripherals)\n120 Communications Equipment\nOther IT Equipment 114\n\n100 +=\nRe\nry 90\n\nso} %\n60 ‘\n40 N\n\n20\n\n0\n1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015\n\nData through 2015.\nNote: Other IT Equipment represents medical and non-medical equipment and instruments.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, Bureau of\nEconomic Analysis.\n\nfrom 50 cents to zero for smartphone users; 1.6\ntrillion photos that would have contributed $800\nbillion to GDP have no impact on GDP in the\ncurrent framework. GDP has declined since camera\nand film sales have fallen without a commensurate\nquality adjustment for smartphones. Of course,\nfewer photos would have been taken had the\nsmartphone not been developed, but the point\n\nstill stands.\n\nSimilarly, Varian shows that with the onset of\nthe commercial application of GPS technology,\nproductivity growth in trucking was twice the\naggregate US productivity growth, yet when GPS\nfunctionality was added to smartphones basically\nat no additional charge, GDP declined because\nsales of stand-alone GPS systems fell.*4\n\nFinally, a third example, also provided by\nVarian, shows that, because GDP does not fully\ncount the export of intangibles such as software\nand design, GDP is understated. He shows how an\niPhone manufactured by Foxconn in China using\nparts from 28 countries and exported to France\nhas no direct impact on US GDP.

I’d arranged for\nShlomo Ben-Ami to go to Kiryat Shmona in the north — emphasizing, as\nthroughout the campaign, our determination to broaden our support beyond\nLabor’s heartland. The polls closed at 10 o’clock. I knew Bibi would be staring at\nthe same Channel One newscast as I was, each of us ready to put the best spin on\nthings, especially if there was no clear sign at this stage which one of us had won.\nBut the exit poll findings came as a shock: Barak, of One Israel, 58.5 percent;\nNetanyahu, Likud, 41.5 percent. It was a landslide.\n\nThe full impact hit me only when I got to the fifth-floor suite in the Dan Hotel\nin Tel Aviv, our election-night headquarters. My three brothers, and Nava and our\ndaughters, were waiting for me. Leah Rabin, too. Our eyes teared up as we\nembraced. My parents were by now too frail to come. But I’d promised to phone\nthem, whatever happened. “We did it,” I told my father, who said mazaltov with a\ndepth of feeling which had become rare as his health began to fail. My mother had\nalways been a bit conflicted about my going into politics, despite her lifelong\nbelief that the isswes of politics mattered, especially after Yitzhak had been cut\ndown and killed for following the path on which I hoped to continue. Still, I could\nhear the pride, and relief, in her voice when I said: “Remember, ima. I did promise\nyou that if I ran, at least I'd make sure to win.”\n\nWhen we’d finished speaking, Bibi called. He had conceded publicly as soon\nas the exit poll was out. He had also stunned the Likud crowd by immediately\nresigning as party leader. “Congratulations,” he said, sounding, more than\nanything, tired. “I accept that the voters have spoken.” I thanked him for taking the\ntrouble to call. I said I appreciated the contribution he’d made to the country, and\nthat we’d meet in the next few days to discuss how best to handle the political\ntransition. “Thanks,” Bibi said. “And again, mazaltov.”\n\nBy the time I got off the phone with Bibi, the TV was showing pictures of tens\nof thousands of people celebrating the results in the central Tel Aviv square, now\nrenamed in Rabin’s memory, where he had been murdered nearly four years\nearlier. Before leaving to join them, I fielded a stream of calls: from friends, other\nIsraeli party leaders and leaders from abroad, including Tony Blair and Bill\nClinton, both of whom not only offered warm congratulations but said they looked\nforward to working with me as I tried to move Israel forward and to finish the\nwork Yitzhak had begun.\n\n317\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028165\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

WILLIAMS, PH.D.11 Mar 2018 \n0 \nAs Steve Bannon continues his tour of Europe, energizing the anti-\nestablishment populist base, the mainstream media cannot help but \nadmit their admiration for his abilities, despite their dislike of his aims. \nIn this week's issue, the left-wing German weekly Stern articulates the greatest fear of the European \nestablishment: that Bannon \"could give the fragmented right in Europe a common ideology and rhetoric.\" \nMany thought that the reign of the \"Dark Lord\" had ended, writes Gernot Kramper, when Steve Bannon left \nfirst the White House and then his role as executive chairman of Breitbart News. It turns out, however, that \nBannon's adversaries had underestimated him, because he is \"as dangerous as ever,\" he confesses. \nKramper cannot conceal his respect for Bannon's ability to move a crowd. He was greeted by \"frenetic \napplause\" in his recent address before France's National Front party, Kramper writes, demonstrating his \n\"impressive potential,\" which the writer describes as \"dangerous.\" \nIn the mind of his audience, Bannon is something of a miracle-worker, Stamper notes, having \"done the \nimpossible\" by bringing Donald Trump into the White House. \nThe reason Bannon is dangerous, Kramper continues, is because he \"lays out the political program of a \nworldwide right: He has already conquered the USA; now Europe and then the whole world will follow.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025534 \n\"You are part of a worldwide movement that is bigger than France, bigger than Italy, bigger than Hungary, \nbigger than all that,\" Bannon told French populists. \nBannon showed that he \"dominates the mood against the 'elites,' the 'establishment' and the 'perverse \nsystem' of greedy corporations and banks, and of course also against the press, which is led around 'like a dog \non the Leash,\" Stamper writes. \nAnd now he Mr. Bannon setting himself up as an instigator, if not an outright shepherd, of a movement that \ncrosses borders, languages and parties. \n\"Bannon is a master of apocalyptic rhetoric,\" Stamper continues, effortlessly weaving together nationalist \ninterests with an international populist movement. \nThe American strategist showed his \"true caliber\" by expounding modern methods of political freedom \nthrough blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies, Stamper said, leaving many of his hearers behind. \nBannon has demonstrated that if the right wants to rule the future, \"it must dominate modern themes and \nrhetorically position them,\" he added. \nAspiring to be far more than an uncle who tells stories to his nephews of how he won the fight for the White \nHouse, Stamper writes, \"Bannon wants to become the super godfather of the international right.\" \nAlthough Bannon often looks a bit disheveled, \"he should not be underestimated,\" the writer warns. Past \nbusiness partners attribute impressive \"strategic foresight\" to the eccentric tactician, saying he was often \n\"three or four steps ahead\" of his opponents in business. Because of his phenomenal memory, his nickname is \n\"the encyclopedia,\" Stamper notes with a certain reverence, and in his speeches he will spontaneously cite \n\"forgotten thinkers, known only to a handful of specialists.\" \n\"Bannon brings with him exclusive knowledge of power from the very heart of power,\" Stamper writes, \nwhich he will bring to bear on Europe's fragmented populist populism. \nAccording to Stamper, Bannon has established his \"European headquarters\" in Italy, from where he intends to \ngalvanize European populists. \nThe Italian political situation is completely to his liking, Stamper declares, with a political landscape \n\"dominated by populists, right-wing ideologues and the political puppeteer Berlusconi.\" \nFollow Thomas D.

Just five years\nearlier, Chief Justice Earl Warren had written in Trop v. Dulles (1958) that “whatever the\narguments may be against capital punishment, both on moral grounds and in terms of\naccomplishing the purposes of punishment—and they are forceful—the death penalty has been\nemployed throughout our history, and, in a day when it is still widely accepted it cannot be said to\nviolate the constitutional concept of cruelty.”\n\nI duly reported this to Justice Goldberg, suggesting that if even the liberal chief justice believed\nthat the death penalty was constitutional, what chance did he have of getting a serious hearing for\nhis view that the cruel and unusual punishment clause should now be construed to prohibit the\nimposition of capital punishment? Justice Goldberg asked me to talk to Justice Brennan and see\nwhat his views were. Unless Justice Brennan agreed to join, the entire project would be scuttled,\nsince Justice Goldberg, the Court’s rookie, did not want to “be out there alone,” against the chief\njustice and the rest of the Court.\n\nI had previously met Justice Brennan several times over the preceding few years, since his son,\nBill, was my classmate and moot-court partner at Yale Law School. I had also had lunch several\ntimes with the justice and his friend Judge David Bazelon. But none of our discussions had been\nsubstantive, and I nervously anticipated the task of discussing an important issue with one of my\njudicial heroes.\n\nI brought a rough draft of the memorandum I was working on to the meeting, but Justice Brennan\ndid not want to look at it then. He asked me to describe the results of my research to him,\npromising to read the memorandum later. I stated the nascent constitutional case against the\ndeath penalty as best I could. I told him that Weems v. United States could be read as recognizing\nthe following tests for whether punishment was “cruel and unusual”: (I) giving full weight to\nreasonable legislative findings, a punishment is cruel and unusual if a less severe one can as\neffectively achieve the permissible ends of punishment (that is, deterrence, isolation, rehabilitation,\nor whatever the contemporary society considers the permissible objectives of punishment);\n\n(2) regardless of its effectiveness in achieving the permissible ends of punishment, a punishment is\ncruel and unusual if it offends the contemporary sense of decency (for example, torture); (3)\nregardless of its effectiveness in achieving the permissible ends of punishment, a punishment is\ncruel and unusual if the evil it produces is disproportionally\n\nhigher than the harm it seeks to prevent (for example, the death penalty for economic crimes).\n\nIn addition to these abstract formulations, I also told Justice Brennan that my research had\ndisclosed a widespread pattern of unequal application of the death penalty on racial grounds. I\ncited national prison statistics showing that between 1937 and 1951, 233 Blacks were executed\nfor rape in the United States, while only 26 whites were executed for that crime, though Whites\ncommitted many more rapes than Blacks.\n\nJustice Brennan encouraged me to continue my research, without making any promise that he\nwould join any action by Justice Goldberg. Several weeks later, Justice Goldberg told me that\n\n160\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017247\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Roosevelt\nMemorial. Art © The George and Helen Segal Foundation/Licensed by VAGA,\nNew York, NY.\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 27\n\nLow Expectations of a US Recession\n\nRecessions in the US have been triggered by\nFederal Reserve tightening of monetary policy; by\neconomic imbalances such as the bursting of the\ndot-com and housing bubbles in 2000 and 2008,\nrespectively; or by external shocks such as the Arab\noil embargo in 1973. The first two triggers are\nunlikely to occur in 2017, and the third, a shock,\nis not something that we can typically anticipate.\nHowever, we do think that China will be a\n\nsource of downside risk sometime over the next\nthree years.\n\nFirst, as we mentioned in last year’s Outlook,\nthere have been five tightening cycles in the post-\nWWII period that have not triggered a recession.\nFour of those cycles occurred during the three\nlongest recoveries, as shown in Exhibit 24. Those\ncycles have been characterized by an early start\nto the tightening cycle, a slow pace relative to\nhistorical averages (220 basis points per year for\nnonrecessionary tightening and 330 basis points per\nyear in recessionary cycles), low core inflation and\nslack in the labor market. This cycle shares those\ncharacteristics: the tightening cycle started in 2015,\nthe pace has been 25 basis points per year, the core\npersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) index—\nthe Federal Reserve’s preferred benchmark for\ninflation—is at 1.6% year over year as of November\n2016, and our colleagues in GIR estimate that the\nlabor market still has about 0.3% slack.\n\nSecond, the US economy does not\nsuffer from any imbalances in which one\nsector of the economy has become the\nsole driver of growth or equity market\nreturns. Before the global financial crisis,\nresidential investment as a percentage\nof GDP had peaked at 6.7% in 2005,\ncompared to a long-term average of\n4.7%, and the credit-to-GDP gap as a\nmeasure of nonfinancial sector leverage\nhad peaked at 12.4% in 2007 compared\nto a long-term average of -1%, leading\nto meaningful imbalances. Similarly, in\n2000, technology and telecommunication\nsector valuations were more than three\nstandard deviations higher than the\naverage of other sectors. Such imbalances\ndo not exist in the US at this time.\n\nThird, while we cannot anticipate an\nexternal shock—otherwise it would not\nbe a shock—we do not see imbalances in\nother large economies except in China.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014560\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But more importantly,\nIran's tooth and nail defence of the brutal Assad regime in Syria is\nprogressively destroying its already shallow support Sunni Muslims.\nThus, a recent poll by the Arab-American Institute asked more than\n4,000 Arabs their view of Iran. In Saudi Arabia, 6% had a positive\nview — down from 89% in 2006. In Jordan, the positive rating fell\nfrom 75% to 23%, in Egypt from 89% to 37% in the same period. The\nuprising in Syria placed Iran in an impossible position. Maintaining\nits ally in Damascus formed an essential strategic interest. Iran hoped,\nfollowing the US departure from Iraq, to achieve a contiguous line of\npro-Iranian, Shia states stretching from Iran itself to the\nMediterranean. But keeping this ambition alive in recent months\nrequired offering very visible support to a non-Sunni regime engaged\nin the energetic slaughter of its own, largely Sunni people. This has\nled to the drastic decline in the standing of the Iranians and their\nfriends. Such a decline was probably inevitable. Outside the core\nareas of Shia Arab population, Iran's support was broad but shallow.\nIt is noteworthy that since the Arab Spring, Hamas appears to have\ndistanced itself both from Assad and from the Iranians.

Young children rapidly\nlearn abstract intuitive theories of biology, physics, and psychology in much the way\nadult scientists do, even with relatively little data.\n\nThe remarkable machine-learning accomplishments of the recent AI systems, both\nbottom-up and top-down, take place in a narrow and well-defined space of hypotheses\nand concepts—a precise set of game pieces and moves, a predetermined set of images. In\ncontrast, children and scientists alike sometimes change their concepts in radical ways,\nperforming paradigm shifts rather than simply tweaking the concepts they already have.\n\nFour-year-olds can immediately recognize cats and understand words, but they\ncan also make creative and surprising new inferences that go far beyond their experience.\nMy own grandson recently explained, for example, that if an adult wants to become a\nchild again, he should try not eating any healthy vegetables, since healthy vegetables\nmake a child grow into an adult. This kind of hypothesis, a plausible one that no grown-\nup would ever entertain, is characteristic of young children. In fact, my colleagues and I\nhave shown systematically that preschoolers are better at coming up with unlikely\nhypotheses than older children and adults.*? We have almost no idea how this kind of\ncreative learning and innovation is possible.\n\nLooking at what children do, though, may give programmers useful hints about\ndirections for computer learning. Two features of children’s learning are especially\nstriking. Children are active learners; they don’t just passively soak up data like Als do.\nJust as scientists experiment, children are intrinsically motivated to extract information\nfrom the world around them through their endless play and exploration. Recent studies\nshow that this exploration is more systematic than it looks and is well-adapted to find\npersuasive evidence to support hypothesis formation and theory choice.*° Building\ncuriosity into machines and allowing them to actively interact with the world might be a\nroute to more realistic and wide-ranging learning.\n\nSecond, children, unlike existing Als, are social and cultural learners. Humans\ndon’t learn in isolation but avail themselves of the accumulated wisdom of past\ngenerations. Recent studies show that even preschoolers learn through imitation and by\nlistening to the testimony of others. But they don’t simply passively obey their teachers.\nInstead they take in information from others in a remarkably subtle and sensitive way,\nmaking complex inferences about where the information comes from and how\ntrustworthy it is and systematically integrating their own experiences with what they are\nhearing.!\n\n“Artificial intelligence” and “machine learning” sound scary. And in some ways\nthey are. These systems are being used to control weapons, for example, and we really\nshould be scared about that. Still, natural stupidity can wreak far more havoc than\nartificial intelligence; we humans will need to be much smarter than we have been in the\npast to properly regulate the new technologies. But there is not much basis for either the\napocalyptic or the utopian visions of AIs replacing humans. Until we solve the basic\n\n3° A.

As always, though, there's some mixed feedback\ntoo. And I've been worried about one thing in particular: it seems like a lot of people\nmissed the part in my article where I said that, now that I've learned how to have\norgasms... orgasms aren't even my favorite part of sex. It's a long article, and I can see\nhow people would miss that, but I did say it and I think it's important.\n\nIt may be ironic that I spent so much time feeling terrible and broken and depressed\nbecause I couldn't figure out how to have orgasms... whereas now I prefer not to focus on\nthem. In fact, I estimate that most of my current sexual encounters don't include my\norgasm, and very few of my most pleasurable sexual encounters have included my\norgasm.\n\nI'm the first to admit that I don't know everything about sex, and there's a lot that I haven't\nexperienced. Anything might change. But seriously. The best sex I've had in my life has\nbeen connective and emotional and, for me personally, has frequently involved intense\nBDSM. My favorite sex so far? Has also mostly been orgasm-free.\n\nSome people in some sex-related communities have asserted that for maximum amorous\npower, it's actually best to limit one’s orgasms, because then the contained sexual energy\nends up channeling into a deeper connection with one's partner. I can see that. For me,\nanother way of thinking about it is that I'm really into being teased -- and I'd rather\nexperience hours of being teased without an orgasm, than have a quick encounter that\nends in orgasm.\n\nAnd.... (Oh no, I can already tell this is going to get complicated... but hey, sex is\ncomplicated, so I'll give it a shot.).... Especially when I'm doing BDSM, it can actually be\nhot sometimes if I don't have an orgasm. For example: if I go to sleep so turned on that I\ncan't dream about anything but my partner, and then I wake up in a damp mess, and then\nmy partner makes my life difficult all morning, it's pretty awesome. (Although it's very\nnice that I know how to give myself orgasms now, because that means that if I'm really\nfeeling overwhelmed by my own sexual energy, I know how to give myself release if I\nhave to. You know, like... if I need to get some work done.)\n\nAaaaand... here's the most painful, ridiculous, circular irony of all. Ready? Here goes:\nnow that I'm capable of having orgasms, I've found myself occasionally having orgasms\nonly to satisfy my partner. How absurd is that? Plus, I know I'm not alone, because I've\ntalked to other women who do the same thing!\n\nI've written before that in the past I've felt trapped by fake plastic ideas of \"what hot girls\nlook like during sex\"; I've written about how the pressure to \"perform\" my sexuality can\nhurt. What has amazed me, as I've gotten older, is just how pervasive that pressure can\nfeel with some partners... and how little pressure there is with other partners. The\nquestion of how to create a low-pressure environment for sexuality to flourish is big and\ncomplicated, so let me just say here that although I'm all about people giving each other\norgasms... it's no good if my partner's desire to give me an orgasm turns into pressure for\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018515\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The Los Angeles\nRam’s Hall of Fame defensive end, on very high doses of amphetamine (125\nmilligrams compared with the diet dose of 5 milligrams) taken four hours before the\nSunday games, the Baptist minister, Deacon Jones, used his famous and\nconsciousness annihilating head slap to daze the opposing offensive tackle in order\nto gain access to and injure the other team’s quarterback. Before taking the handful\nof Dexedrine spansuls, he would tell me, “See you on Tuesday.” Along with the\nDeacon’s destructive aggression was the other invariant feature of the actions of\nhigh doses of amphetamine, compulsive stereotypy, the fixity and driven repetition\nof over simplified actions and thoughts along with the loss of breadth of vision and\nadaptive flexibility. Deacon consistently rushed inside, took the inside lane, in spite\nof offensive linemen, who having studied previous game films, being set up to\nexpect his route. They used this knowledge to take him out of the play. In modern\ntheological parlance, judgmental rigidity and thinly veiled disapproval take the place\nof the more flexibly curious and lovingly humane feelings of the participants in the\nevolution in spiritual understanding of today’s /iberal Protestant process religions.\nThese are the ones that believe that the properties of God evolve along with our\nbiology, our brains and our growing scientific understanding of ourselves and the\nworld.\n\nAngry splitting is not just a stimulant drug effect. Recall my experience of the\nsudden emergence of a first second wind after a mile or so of my daily ten miles of\nrunning. It was frequently accompanied by inner bursts of obsessive, paranoid\nthoughts. Taking five milligrams of amphetamine felt much like the first second\nwind. | am full of energy with arrogant feelings of power, mind fixated in grand and\nsimple ideas that | believe to be absolute and correct. | feel irritably intolerant about\n\nanyone or anything different.

It turned out to be a rotating neutron\nstar.\n\nOne criterion to apply to a potentially purposeful phenomenon is whether it’s\nminimal in achieving a purpose. But does that mean that it was built for the purpose?\nThe ball rolls down the hill because of gravitational pull. Or the ball rolls down the hill\nbecause it’s satisfying the principle of least action. There are typically these two\nexplanations for some action that seems purposeful: the mechanistic explanation and the\nteleological. Essentially all of our existing technology fails the test of being minimal in\nachieving its purpose. Most of what we build is steeped in technological history, and it’s\nincredibly non-minimal for achieving its purpose. Look at a CPU chip; there’s no way\nthat that’s the minimal way to achieve what a CPU chip achieves.\n\nThis question of how to identify purposefulness is a hard one. It’s an important\nquestion, because radio noise from the galaxy is very similar to CDMA transmissions\nfrom cell phones. Those transmissions use pseudo-noise sequences, which happen to\nhave certain repeatability properties. But they come across as noise, and they’re set up as\nnoise, so as not to interfere with other channels. The issue gets messier. If we were to\nobserve a sequence of primes being generated from a pulsar, we’d ask what generated\nthem. Would it mean that a whole civilization grew up and discovered primes and\ninvented computers and radio transmitters and did this? Or is there just some physical\nprocess making primes? There’s a little cellular automaton that makes primes. You can\nsee how it works if you take it apart. It has a little thing bouncing inside it, and out\ncomes a sequence of primes. It didn’t need the whole history of civilization and biology\nand so on to get to that point.\n\nI don’t think there is abstract “purpose,” per se. I don’t think there’s abstract\nmeaning. Does the universe have a purpose? Then you’re doing theology in some way.\nThere is no meaningful sense in which there is an abstract notion of purpose. Purpose is\nsomething that comes from history.\n\nOne of the things that might be true about our world is that maybe we go through\nall this history and biology and civilization, and at the end of the day the answer is “42,”\nor something. We went through all those 4 billion years of various kinds of evolution\nand then we got to “42.”\n\nNothing like that will happen, because of computational irreducibility. There are\ncomputational processes that you can go through in which there is no way to shortcut that\nprocess. Much of science has been about shortcutting computation done by nature. For\nexample, if we’re doing celestial mechanics and want to predict where the planets will be\na million years from now, we could follow the equations, step-by-step. But the big\nachievement in science is that we’re able to shortcut that and reduce the computation.\nWe can be smarter than the universe and predict the endpoint without going through all\nthe steps. But even with a smart enough machine and smart enough mathematics, we\ncan’t get to the endpoint without going through the steps. Some details are irreducible.\nWe have to irreducibly follow those steps. That’s why history means something. If we\ncould get to the endpoint without going through the steps, history would be, in some\nsense, pointless.\n\nSo it’s not the case that we’re intelligent and everything else in the world is not.\nThere’s no enormous abstract difference between us and the clouds or us and the\ncellular automata. We cannot say that this brainlike neural network is qualitatively\n\n191\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016411\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

By contrast, the\n\ncontent of Radio Free Asia remains far more hard-hitting than its counterpart, VOA.\n\nConclusion and Recommendations\n\nChina has used America’s openness to convey its message both to English- and\nChinese-speaking residents of the United States. US rules allow foreign media\ncompanies, even ones run by foreign governments, to broadcast freely via American\ncable and satellite networks. Unlike in China, the United States government does\n\nnot block any Chinese websites, many of which are funded by the PRC government.\nWhile the Communications Act of 1934 theoretically only allows foreigners to own\n\n20 to 25 percent of terrestrial wireless radio and TV stations, the law has been loosened\nconsiderably over the past decade, and it does not even apply to cable channels or leasing\narrangements wherein a foreign entity, including one owned by a foreign government,\ncan pay an American licensee for airtime. Chinese media outlets have used all such\nstrategies to publicize the views of the Beijing government.** Perhaps more worrisome,\nChina has also been successful in funding or convincing pro-PRC businessmen to fund\npro-PRC media outlets in the United States that nominally appear independent so that\nthe three most important traditionally independent Chinese-language newspapers now\n\nincreasingly side with Beijing.\n\nBy contrast, the Chinese government severely limits the scope of US and other Western\nmedia outlets in China and has banned Western media investment in China, except in\nvery limited innocuous areas, such as in fashion, automobiles, investing, health, and\nlifestyle. The idea that a Western TV news network could lease a Chinese station and\nbroadcast news to China around the clock—as their Chinese counterparts do here in\nthe United States—is not even thinkable. Equally, there is no chance that a Western\n\nmedia company would be allowed to invest in a Chinese publication that reported\n\nmainstream news.\n\nBoth the expansion of Chinese state-owned English-language media in the United\nStates and Beijing’s increasing control of Chinese-language media outlets in the United\n\nStates are very problematic for an open dialogue.

The Party also resumed publishing material for overseas Chinese. During the\nCultural Revolution, the number of magazines targeting overseas Chinese had shrunk\nto ten, whereas by the end of the 1980s, it had surpassed 130. Before 1982, the state-run\nXinhua News Agency had focused almost solely on providing news to domestic Chinese\nclients. In 1983, however, it also began sending news to international clients. The China\nNews Service, which had suspended operations during the Cultural Revolution, also\nresumed work, sending hundreds of stories a day to overseas Chinese-language media.\nToday the CNS employs more than two thousand people worldwide, working out of\nforty-six bureaus.

VARGOVA, PH.D.\n\nThe Promise of Governance\n\nReform—South Korea\n\nn his inauguration speech on May 10th, the newly elected\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-In vowed to put chaebol\n\nreform at the forefront of his political and economic agenda.\n“Under the Moon Jae-In administration,” he asserted, “the\ncollusive link between politics and business will completely\ndisappear.’ The promise of meaningful governance reform\ncomes in the wake of the biggest political corruption scandal in\nKorea that saw the impeachment and the arrest of democratically\nelected President Park Geun-Hye on charges of “collecting or\ndemanding $52 million in bribes”? from Samsung, one of\nKorea’s largest family-owned conglomerates, known as chaebol.\n\nThe presidential scandal in Korea also led to the latest high-\nprofile corporate arrest in the country. In February, Jay Y. Lee,\nvice chairman and acting leader of Samsung’s conglomerate\nempire, was arrested on accusations of bribery to former\nPresident Park and her inner circle in exchange for securing a\ncontroversial merger of Samsung Construction and Trading\nCorporation and Cheil Industries. While the image of a\nhandcuffed Lee sent shockwaves across the business world, his\narrest was not unprecedented. In the past, his father Lee Kun-\nHee, current chairman of Samsung, was convicted twice of\ncorruption and pardoned. Similarly, in 2007, Hyundai’s\nChairman Chung Mon-Koo was found guilty of fraud and\npardoned. And in 2013, SK’s Chairman Chey Tae-Won was\nconvicted of embezzlement and later pardoned.’ The family-\nowned conglomerates have long dominated the economic life\nof modern Korean society, accounting for roughly 50% of the\ntotal share of the Korean stock market. Their close ties with the\ngovernment and state bureaucracy have fueled growing public\ndistrust and frustration with the nation’s leadership and has led\nto increased shareholder discontent.\n\nKorea’s Governance Practices\n\nThe collusion of politics and business in Korea highlights the\npoor practices of corporate governance and business ethics.\nCorporate governance studies on Asia consistently rate Korea as\nlagging in governance behind leaders in the region.* Korea\nunderperforms its peers in the areas of board independence,\nethics and transparency in corporate governance.\n\nGLOBAL FORESIGHT THIRD QUAPTER 2017\n\nSenior Vice President,\nSenior Sustainability\nand Impact Analyst\n\n212.549.5236\n\nmvargova@rockco.com\n\nKorea, however, has not always been viewed as the laggard in\nAsia’s governance landscape. Right after the Asian Financial\nCrisis of 1997-1998, the country underwent important\ngovernance reforms that sought to quickly and significantly\nincrease corporate board independence and the overall\ngovernance of publicly-traded Korean companies. For instance,\nthe proportion of listed firms with at least one outside director\ngrew from 34% in 1999, to 62.3% in 2000, to reach 94% in 2007.°\nIn 2001 and 2003, the country’s Security Exchange Acts required\nlarge listed companies (those with about $2 billion in market\ncapitalization) on the Korea Exchange and KOSDAQ to have at\nleast three outside directors and for one half of their boards to\nbe independent. In 2004, the board independence requirements\nwere further strengthened with the stipulation that there be a\nmajority of independent board directors for large companies.\nThis is on par with leading international best practices in\ncorporate governance. The Korean Commercial Code also\nstipulates that outside or independent directors must not be\nrelated to management while acting as fiduciaries.® This\nresonated with the impetus towards greater board independence\nto mitigate the role of corporate insiders and create new\nindependent auditing structures within Korean corporations.\n\nIn 2012, the Korean Commercial Code was revised to further\nenhance the board’s fiduciary duties. It required the approval of\ntwo-thirds of directors for all internal transactions and for new\nbusiness dealings with third parties. If transactions or deals\nbenefit founding families or management at the expense of\nminority shareholders, the approving directors will be personally\nliable for the losses.’\n\nNotwithstanding these developments towards good governance,\nethics controversies involving Korean chaebols surged over the\npast several years. A prime example is the notorious Hyundai\nMotor land bid in 2014 for which the company paid the excessive\nprice of $10 billion, three times the land’s market value of $3\nbillion, angering investors and hurting shareholder value.\nAccording to reports, while the boards of directors of Hyundai\nconsortium companies voted to unanimously approve the deal,\nthe company’s outside directors were kept in the dark about the\nprice as it was considered by management to be a confidential\nmatter.

Pfizer, Inc., 562 F.3d 163, 177 (2d Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct.\n3541 (2010). As the district court recognized, SPA233 (Terrorist Attacks V), aircraft hijacking has long been recognized as a\nviolation of international law that meets these criteria and can give rise to tort claims under the ATS. See, e.g., Kadic v.\nKaradzic, 70 R3d 232, 239 (2d Cir. 1996); cf United States v. Yunis, 924 F.2d 1086, 1092 (D.C. Cir. 1991). What the district\ncourt failed to recognize, however, is that the broader concept of international terrorism is also a violation of customary\ninternational law that is actionable under the ATS, and plaintiffs adequately alleged that defendants engaged in, and aided\nand abetted, illegal acts of international terrorism.\n\n*123 A. Plaintiffs Alleged That Defendants Violated the ATS By Intentionally Facilitating International Terrorism\n\nThe Burnett plaintiffs allege that “the Defendants, individually, jointly and severally, aided and abetted, sponsored, financed,\npromoted, fostered, materially supported, or otherwise conspired to proximately cause the death and injury of innocent\npersons namely the Plaintiffs herein through and by reason of acts of international terrorism -- the heinous attacks of\nSeptember 11, 2001.” JA970. “As a result and proximate cause of the Defendants’ sponsorship of terrorism in violation of the\nlaw of nations and customary principles of international law, the Plaintiffs suffered injury and damages as set forth herein.”\nJA972. Such allegations state a claim under the ATS because facilitation of international terrorism is a violation of customary\ninternational law that is universal, obligatory, specific and of mutual concern to States.\n\nB. Acts of International Terrorism are a Violation of Customary International Law\n\nIn considering whether alleged violations of customary international law are universal, obligatory, specific and of mutual\nconcern to States, courts consider whether the conduct is banned by international conventions and treaties ratified by an\noverwhelming majority of States, *124 condemned by binding United Nations Security Council resolutions, and repudiated\nby individual nations. See, e.g., Flores v. S. Peru Copper Corp., 414 F.3d 233, 256-57, 261-62 (2d Cir. 2003); Filartiga v.\nPena-lrala, 630 F.2d 876, 881-84 (2d Cir. 1980). Because the Constitution specifically gives Congress the power to “define\nand punish ... Offenses against the Law of Nations,” U.S. Const., art. I, § 8, cl. 10, courts should also accord deference to\nCongress’s determination of what conduct constitutes an offense under the law of nations. See, e.g., Ex parte Quirin, 317\nUSS. 1, 26 (1942).\n\nPlaintiffs have stated valid ATS claims because international conventions, U.N. Security Council resolutions, the domestic\nlaws of many nations, and laws enacted by Congress pursuant to its authority to define and punish offenses against the laws\nof nations all demonstrate that there is a universal and obligatory norm against the commission of and material support of\ninternational terrorism alleged here -- namely, transnational acts intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to civilians\nfor the purpose of intimidating the population or compelling a government to do some act or refrain from acting.\n\n*125 I. United Nations Security Council resolutions\n\nThe U.N. Security Council has adopted numerous resolutions condemning international terrorism and support for\ninternational terrorism. In 1998, for example, the Security Counsel adopted a resolution “[s]trongly condemn[ing] the\nterrorist bomb attacks” on the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7, 1998 “which claimed hundreds of\ninnocent lives, injured thousands of people, and caused massive destruction to property.” S.C. Res. 1189, U.N. Doc.\nS/RES/1189 (Aug. 13, 1998) at § 1.

In the case of magnetic materials, there are plenty of ways to do that.\nIn terms of programs, it’s the same story. There are all kinds of programs out there, even\ntiny programs that do complicated things. Could we entrain them for some useful human\npurpose?\n\nAnd how do you get Als to execute your goals? One answer is to just talk to\nthem, in the natural language of human utterances. It works pretty well when you’re\ntalking to Siri. But when you want to say something longer and more complicated, it\ndoesn’t work well. You need a computer language that can represent sophisticated\nconcepts in a way that can be progressively built up and isn’t possible in natural\nlanguage. What my company spent a lot of time doing was building a knowledge-based\nlanguage that incorporates the knowledge of the world directly into the language. The\ntraditional approach to creating a computer language is to make a language that\nrepresents operations that computers intrinsically know how to do: allocating memory,\nsetting values of variables, iterating things, changing program counters, and so on.\nFundamentally, you’re telling computers to do things in your own terms. My approach\nwas to make a language that panders not to the computers but to the humans, to take\nwhatever a human thinks of and convert it into some form that the computer can\nunderstand. Could we encapsulate the knowledge we’d accumulated, both in science and\nin data collection, into a language we could use to communicate with computers? That’s\nthe big achievement of my last thirty years or so—being able to do that.\n\nBack in the 1960s, people would say things like, “When we can do such-and-\nsuch, we’ll know we have AI. When we can do an integral from a calculus course, we’ll\nknow we have AI. When we can have a conversation with a computer and make it seem\nhuman... ,” et cetera. The difficulty was, “Well, gosh, the computer just doesn’t know\nenough about the world.” You’d ask the computer what day of the week it was, and it\nmight be able to answer that. You'd ask it who the President was, and it probably\ncouldn’t tell you. At that point, you’d know you were talking to a computer and not a\nperson. But now when it comes to these Turing Tests, people who’ ve tried connecting,\nfor example, Wolfram|Alpha to their Turing Test bots find that the bots lose every time.\nBecause all you have to do 1s start asking the machine sophisticated questions and it will\nanswer them! No human can do that. By the time you’ve asked it a few disparate\nquestions, there will be no human who knows all those things, yet the system will know\nthem. In that sense, we’ve already achieved good AI, at that level.\n\nThen there are certain kinds of tasks easy for humans but traditionally very hard\nfor machines. The standard one is visual object identification: What is this object?\nHumans can recognize it and give some simple description of it, but a computer was just\nhopeless at that. A couple of years ago, though, we brought out a little image-\nidentification system, and many other companies have done something similar—ours\nhappens to be somewhat better than the rest. You show it an image, and for about ten\nthousand kinds of things, it will tell you what it is. It’s fun to show it an abstract painting\nand see what it says. But it does a pretty good job.\n\nIt works using the same neural-network technology that McCulloch and Pitts\nimagined in 1943 and lots of us worked on in the early eighties. Back in the 1980s,\npeople successfully did OCR—optical character recognition. They took the twenty-six\nletters of the alphabet and said, “OK, is that an A? Is that a B? Is that a C?” and so on.\n\n185\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016405\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Anxiety began seeping back. My Unified Orgasm Theory was not doing well.\n\nMy fear of being perceived as \"demanding\" during sex and relationships was at a\nridiculous extreme back then. For example, I'd heard over and over that boys don't like\ngirls who are \"high-maintenance,\" so I told my boyfriends that I never wanted them to\nbuy me flowers. I thought that men would feel relieved that they didn't \"have to cater to\nme,\" but they were just puzzled.

I couldn't believe that the boyfriends who were willing to go down on me were\nactually enthusiastic about it, enjoying it -- and when my anxiety became too painful, I\ninevitably stopped them. I always stopped them long before I stopped enjoying the act,\nbecause I was so scared that they hated it, and hated me for wanting it. I was scared that\nthey resented me more and more, the longer they did it and I didn't come. My fear crept\nup my spine and twisted around my heart until I had to make them stop.\n\nSometimes I felt trapped between love and disgust, like with the boyfriend who\nconstantly complimented me on how great in bed I was, but who seemed unaware of how\nmuch I felt missing. The worst was when he went off on a rhapsodic list of my wonderful\nqualities ending with: \"... and I don't even have to worry about giving you an orgasm!\"\nHe didn't see the bind he was putting me in, the awful self-suppression and self-wounding\nthat he encouraged. He seemed unaware that I heard him telling me: \"You're great in bed\nbecause you are constantly disappearing your own needs, and never asking anything\ncomplicated of me!”\n\nIn fairness, I wasn't giving him any guidance on how to do better with me. In fairness, I\nhad no idea what kind of guidance to give.\n\nThey had their own social programming, and I didn't communicate well.

One, in\nparticular, resisted very strongly; never did it at all. This was an especial problem because\nhe was one of the men I've loved most in my life, and our relationship lasted for years. I\nthink well of him when I think of anything other than sex. But when I remember having\nsex with him, I feel echoes of sick panic and heartbreak.\n\nBy the end, every time I slept with him I felt nothing but disgust.\n\nHe seemed to prove all my fears: that the men in my life would loathe and resent me if I\ntried to discuss my confusion and desperation; that they would loathe and resent me if I\n\nasked for help with my sexual needs. Towards the beginning of our relationship, I tried\n\nasking him (very timidly) to go down on me, and he simply refused.

That is, we teach others how to treat us. The game of guilt, along with other\nControl Factor tools, teaches our Enemy it is winning and to continue playing.\n\nFP: The reason Nidal Hasan was able to perpetrate his murder spree at Fort Hood is precisely because of\nour Control Factor. Please connect the dots for our readers.\n\nSiegel: Just as I used to look at Hitler when I was young and be amazed that no one could see what he was\nabout, in retrospect the same applies to Hasan. It is precisely all the elements of the Control Factor that\ncould allow this man, a Soldier of Allah, to be positioned as he was. He was blatantly voicing his Islamist\nviews and Jihadi intent including, even, an essay recommending the “painful liquidation” of non-Muslims.\nYet, in the Army of all places, the Control Factor operated to allow and even foster his work. Even after the\nmurders, we cont inue the denial by calling it “workplace violence.” He is the Civilization-Violent Jihad\ncombo! And we continue to enable the same infiltration elsewhere.\n\nFP: Tell our readers about “The Project” and “Explanatory Memorandum.” These are realities that serve as\ngreat threats to the Control Factor, right?\n\nSiegel: These are separate sets of documents that outline the Muslim Brotherhood’s goals and\n\nplans underlying the Civilization Jihad. The former was discovered in Europe and extends globally. The\n1991 Explanatory Memorandum emerged in 2008 from the Holy Land Foundation trial and describes the\nBrotherhood’s work in America as a “Civilization-Jihadist Process with all the word means” and “a kind of\ngrand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and ‘sabotaging’ its\nmiserable house by their own hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God’s religion\nis made victorious over all other religions.”\n\nMuch as the communists of the Soviet Union had formulated in the 1950s a detailed long term plan to\ndestroy America (many of the effects of which we are seeing of late including destroying the\n\nnuclear family, secularizing the nation, feminizing men ...) these documents identify many strategies to\ninfiltrate while eroding the foundations of our civilization in order to transform it into an Islamic one. The\nControl Factor has many ingenious ways to convince us that this is ridiculous, that our courts and system\nwould never allow such a thing, that one is racist or “Islamophobic,” if not insane, for even thinking this is\nreal. And just as with the communists, time is plentiful. Even more so with our Islamic Enemy, a multi-\ndecade plan is short term. It is not critical that a seriou sly engaged Muslim lives to see the result. It is\ncritical, more correctly a duty, however, that he carries on his Jihad. Patrick Poole and The Center for\nSecurity Policy’s Team B Report, Shariah: The Threat to America, are excellent sources for your readers to\npursue these documents.\n\nFP: And so what you call an “Inner Jihad” has to start. It’s our, as you say, mandatory “addiction\ntreatment.” Please explain.\n\nSiegel: The “Inner Jihad” is the effort we must undertake to gain control over our Control Factors. There is\na famous Hadith in which Mohammad, returning from a successful battle, essentially says that the physical\nfight was the “lesser Jihad” and it is time to then attend to the “greater Jihad €”- that internal battle against\nour own internal appetites, lusts, wrong thinking and so forth. While that Hadith has been falsely utilized to\nsay that “Jihad” is not violent, it is useful to us as a symbol of the vicious effort we must take internally\nagainst our own Control Factor tendencies.\n\nAs I said earlier, the Control Factor is “active” and “continuous” so we must constantly monitor and combat\nit. Like “Whack-a-Mole,” just as we may think we have addressed it, another variation pops right up. I use\nthe terms “addict” and “enabler” because we truly need a form of rehab to break the habitual power of the\nControl Factor and because our relationship with our Islamic Enemy is very much like that between a\ntypical addict and his enabler. And just as it is so difficult for an addict to kick his habit, so does the enabler\nact essentially addicted to his behavior and find it so difficult to change. At its core, the relati onship\ninvolves the transfer of responsibility for our Islamic Enemy’s hate and resultant actions onto us with our\nresponse framed essentially as an effort to do what we can to try to address the Enemy’s grievance. (Your\nbook, United in Hate, describes this addiction to hate in detail.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025034\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Garmin's business has exploded into the mainstream, too, and the company ran its first\nSuper Bowl ad this year.

In\nturn, the sum of this active and continuous undertaking makes these perceptions all the more familiar and thus\nseemingly all the more “real.” In one sense, the Control Factor is the mechanism of what Andy McCarthy\nentitled one of his numerous excellent books- willful blindness. The Control Factor is cleverer than we are\naware; that is almost tautological as, if our minds are to create ways to keep us in denial, they must out\nmaneuver our conscious thinking.\n\nSince World War II, America has had limited experience with threats coming to the homeland. Most of\nAmerica’s history has been about “over there,” where we have always known that if things got too out of\nhand (e.g. Vietnam) we could always ret urn home. The current generations, for a wide array of reasons, have\nhad virtually no experience with a threat to this land. (The documentary, Generation Zero, is interesting on\nthis point).\n\nConsequently, the process of waking up to such a threat parallels the arc of a typical horror film. In such a\nfilm, there is typically a cast of characters surrounding one or two main characters. We in the audience know\nthere is a threat coming — be it a monster, a virus, a psycho killer, an alien, the blob that ate Cincinnati etc.\nThis threat is typically defined by its intent- the singular goal of destroying the characters. Much of the initial\nexposition shows how the characters first are oblivious to the destruction the threat brings about, then explain\nit in familiar terms only to finally open their eyes to see that something uniquely terrifying is happening. The\nnext stage usually involves a series of failed attempts to deal with the threat- fr om trying to negotiate with it,\nto appease it, to coax it, to threaten it with ineffective weapons and so forth. Most of these failings are due to\nnot adequately appreciating the threat for what it truly is and projecting onto it a host of other attributes\ninstead. The final stage generally involves a back-up-against-the-wall decision by whichever characters\nremain alive. I named this the “turnaround moment” when the character becomes willing to be as ruthless as\nthe threat. That change in mental state is necessary to ensure survival. Ultimately, the storyline is a race for\nwhichever characters remain to wake up fully and use whatever advantages they may still have to beat the\nthreat.\n\nThis is the same arc our minds go through in battling our own Control Factors, our own compulsions to deny\nthat which is staring us in the face. Ultimately, the question is whether we will be able to wake up while we\nstill have advantages and give ourselves permis sion to fully fight the battle we are in.\n\nI said ear lier that there is a structure to the Control Factor. To oversimplify, I view it much as a pyramid\nwhere on the bottom are the many minute by minute thoughts that are manipulated. I call this level of\nmaneuvers the many ”D’s” as they include the psychological defenses such as distortion, denial,\ndemonization, deflection, deletion, detachment, delusion, displacement, discolorization and so forth. Layered\nupon these are moves such as projection, where we can assign to our Islamic Enemy traits we wish to see in\nthem or introject traits from them into ourselves that we wish not to acknowledge. These maneuvers involve a\nmixing of identities where we actually lose clarity about who we are and who the enemy is. Projection and\nintrojection are active almost across the board. It is always helpful, for instance, to ask how what the enemy\naccuses us of is more appropriately descriptive of it. When we add Western Guilt and Shame, our need to be\nliked, and o ther psychological dimensions, basic thoughts solidify into larger fantasies.\n\nAs these narratives (“Our courts will never allow that,” “As a superpower we will always be able to win any\nfight we put our minds to,” “Assimilation will ensure Muslims are westernized” ...) gain consent from others\nthey tend to guide us deeply and become infused on our policies. Ultimately, what emerges is a relationship\nwe take with our Islamic Enemy that parallels that between an addict and an enabler. Emblematic of this\nrelationship is the “transfer of responsibility” in which we assume responsibility for the enemy’s behavior\nwho is addicted to transferring it away from itself. The Control Factor actively maintains this relationship and\nmakes changing that relationship as difficult a chore as any addict finds in breaking his addiction. And just as\nan addict needs to devote serious effort and con sciousness to his addiction, so must we devote great energy to\nunders tanding how the Control Factor ultimately sabotages us.\n\nFP: Describe the threat we face in our Islamic enemy. And you talk about the three levels of jihad against us.\nWhat are they?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024409\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The case\npresented a series of perplexing scientific and logical riddles: When is a person who has been\nmortally wounded actually dead? Can you kill a man who is already dead? If not, can you\nattempt to kill a man who is already dead if you believe he is still alive.\n\nMy client had watched one acquaintance, who was having a disagreement with another\nacquaintance, shoot him in the heart. The shooter then asked my client to shoot the victim in the\nhead, which he did. On the first appeal, which I argued in Brooklyn, the court reversed the\nmurder conviction on the basis of scientific evidence that it was impossible to know whether the\nvictim was alive or dead at the moment my client shot him in the head, since someone else had\nshot him in the heart just moments earlier. It ruled that the prosecution had not satisfied its\nburden of proving he was still alive when my client’s bullet shattered his brain. The court also\nruled that my client could not be convicted of attempted murder, on the ground that since it is\nfactually impossible to murder a corpse; it is also legally impossible to attempt to do that which it\nis factually impossible to do. On the second appeal, which I argued in Albany, the court agreed\nthat my client could not be convicted of murder because “man dies but once,” but it concluded\nthat he should be convicted of attempted murder. I then brought a federal Habeus Corpus\npetition, and the federal court threw out the attempted murder conviction as well. My client went\nfree. This intriguing case, which I wrote about in more detail Zhe Best Defense, is taught today in\nmany law schools as part of the standard course on criminal law. The issue of whether it is legally\npossible to attempt to do what is factually impossible—namely to kill a dead person—continues\nto confound new generations of law students.\n\nAnother attempted murder case presented a problem right out of the Bible. My client was\naccused of attempting to kill his sister’s former boyfriend. The boyfriend was suspected of\nburning down the sister’s house and burning her severely. She ultimately died of her painful\nburns, but while she was still alive, my client went to her former boyfriend’s home, held a knife\nover his chest and said he would kill him unless he admitted his role in the fire. The police burst\ninto the apartment and disarmed my client before he could stab the former boyfriend. My client\nwas convicted of attempting to kill the former boyfriend, and I was retained to argue the appeal.\n\nI analogized the situation to the one described in the Book of Genesis when God told Abraham to\nsacrifice Isaac, and Abraham stood, knife in hand, ready to inflict the fatal wound when God’s\nangel came down and stopped him. I argued that we can never really know whether my client\nwould actually have killed the boyfriend had the police not intervened, just as we can never know\nfor sure whether Abraham would actually have complied with God’s command. There were other\nissues in the case as well and we won the appeal. The state declined to re-prosecute and this\nclient too went free.\n\n203\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017290\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Twenty five years ago, I had a friend with a peculiar way of responding to seeing things he didn’t like on\nTV: he would throw White Castle hamburgers at the screen. I always thought this was a bad way to waste a good\nhamburger, but I had one of those moments the other night when watching news reports on debt ceiling\n\ndiscussions. Media outlets have referred to President Reagan’s scolding of Congressional Republicans for delaying debt\nceiling increases, and the 18 increases that took place during his Presidency. The implication: reservations about raising\nthe debt ceiling are as irresponsible now as they were then. This is a disingenuous argument; in the 1980’s, the debt\nceiling being debated was 50% of GDP, and had no bearing on the solvency of the United States. Today, the\nproposed increase raises the debt limit twice as high, measured relative to GDP or government revenues. While a default\nis a very bad idea (deserving of a White Castle hurling of its own), unconstrained debt growth with no plan to slow it is\nbad as well. Some suggest we not worry about debt growth, since demand from foreign central banks and the Federal\nReserve would keep yields in check. That logic is irresponsible at best. Debt limit legislation is a rocky but healthy way\nfor a democracy to decide whether mega-deficits are in the long-term public interest.\n\nOver the last few days, the Gang of Six plan, the Reid-McConnell plan and the Obama-Boehner plan have all been\nraised up the flagpole and then lowered. By the end of the process, we’re still looking for deficit reduction of $3\ntrillion+ over 10 years (relative to the CBO Alternative case in which there is no deficit reduction at all). However,\nCongress is running short on time, and may have to do a smaller debt ceiling increase/deficit reduction first. For now,\nwe wait to see the balance of spending cuts and revenue increases will be agreed to. Last week’s Profiles in Courage\npiece walked through the history and dynamics of this process, so we won’t repeat that here. Here’s our take on what\nhas been proposed so far, with the caveat that many plans are not crystal clear what baseline they are using, or what\nsteps they recommend to get to that baseline first. For example: the Gang of Six state that they used the President’s\nbudget as a baseline (scored by CBO in March 2011), reduced deficits by $3.7 trillion, and ended up with a 71%\ndebt/GDP ratio; but they do not explain how they get to the President’s baseline in the first place.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031159\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The role was to be Donald Trump’s heirs and attendees. Their\nfather took some regular pleasure in pointing out that they were in the back of the room\nwhen God handed out brains—but, then again, Trump tended to scorn anyone who might\nbe smarter than he was. Their sister Ivanka, certainly no native genius, was the designated\nfamily smart person, her husband Jared the family’s smooth operator. That left Don and\nEric to errands and admin. In fact, the brothers had grown into reasonably competent\nfamily-owned-company executives (this is not saying all that much) because their father\nhad little or no patience for actually running his company. Of course, quite a good amount\nof their professional time was spent on the whims, projects, promotions, and general way\nof life of DJT.\n\nOne benefit of their father’s run for president was that it kept him away from the office.\nStill, the campaign’s administration was largely their responsibility, so when the campaign\nwent from caprice to a serious development in the Trump business and family, it caused a\ndisruption in the family dynamic. Other people were suddenly eager to be Donald Trump’s\nkey lieutenants. There were the outsiders, like Corey Lewandowski, the campaign\nmanager, but there was also the insider, brother-in-law Jared. Trump, not unusually for a\nfamily-run company, made everybody compete for his favor. The company was about\nhim; it existed because of his name, personality, and charisma, so the highest standing in\nthe company was reserved for those who could best serve him. There wasn’t all that much\ncompetition for this role before he ran for president, but in early 2016, with the\nRepublican Party collapsing and Trump rising, his sons faced a new professional and\nfamily situation.\n\nTheir brother-In-law had been slowly drawn into the campaign, partly at his wife’s\nurging because her father’s lack of constraint might actually affect the Trump business if\nthey didn’t keep an eye on him. And then he, with his brothers-in-law, was pulled in by the\nexcitement of the campaign itself. By late spring 2016, when the nomination was all but\nclinched, the Trump campaign was a set of competing power centers with the knives out.\n\nLewandowski regarded both brothers and their brother-in-law with rolling-on-the-floor\ncontempt: not only were Don Jr. and Eric stupid, and Jared somehow both supercilious\nand obsequious (the butler), but nobody knew a whit about politics—indeed, there wasn’t\nan hour of political experience among them.\n\nAs time went on, Lewandowski became particularly close to the candidate. To the\nfamily, especially to Kushner, Lewandowski was an enabler. Trump’s worst instincts\nflowed through Lewandowski. In early June, a little more than a month before the\nRepublican National Convention, Jared and Ivanka decided that what was needed—for the\nsake of the campaign, for the sake of the Trump business—was an intervention.\n\nMaking common cause with Don Jr. and Eric, Jared and Ivanka pushed for a united\nfront to convince Trump to oust Lewandowski. Don Jr., feeling squeezed not only by\nLewandowski but by Jared, too, seized the opportunity. He would push out Lewandowski\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020075\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

More than 2,300 approved clinical trials for\ngene therapy are in progress worldwide. A major medical goal is the treatment or\nprevention of cognitive decline, especially in light of our rapidly aging global\ndemographic. Some treatments of cognitive decline will include cognitive enhancements\n(drugs, genes, cells, transplants, implants, and so on). These will be used off-label. The\nrules of athletic competition (e.g., banning augmentation with steroids or erythropoietin)\ndo not apply to intellectual competition in the real world. Every bit of progress on\ncognitive decline is in play for off-label use.\n\nAnother frontier of the human use of humans is “brain organoids.” We can now\naccelerate developmental biology. Processes that normally take months can happen in\nfour days in the lab using the right recipes of transcription factors. We can make brains\nthat, with increasing fidelity, recapitulate the differences between people born with\naberrant cognitive abilities (e.g., microcephaly). Proper vasculature (veins, arteries, and\ncapillaries) missing from earlier successes are now added, enabling brain organoids to\nsurpass the former sub-microliter limit to possibly exceed the 1.2-liter size of modern\nhuman brains (or even the 5-liter elephant or 8-liter sperm whale brains).\n\nConventional Computers versus Bio-electronic Hybrids\n\nAs Moore’s Law miniaturization approaches its next speed bump (surely not a solid\nwall), we see the limits of the stochastics of dopant atoms in silicon slabs and the limits\nof beam-fabrication methods at around 10-nanometer feature size. Power (energy\nconsumption) issues are also apparent: The great Watson, winner of Jeopardy!, used\n85,000 watts real time, while the human brains were using 20 watts each. To be fair, the\nhuman body needs 100 watts to operate and twenty years to build, hence about 6 trillion\njoules of energy to “manufacture” a mature human brain. The cost of manufacturing\nWatson-scale computing is similar. So why aren’t humans displacing computers?\n\nFor one, the Jeopardy! contestants’ brains were doing far more than information\nretrieval—much of which would be considered mere distractions by Watson (e.g.,\ncerebellar control of smiling). Other parts allow leaping out of the box with\ntranscendence unfathomable by Watson, such as what we see in Einstein’s five annus\nmirabilis papers of 1905. Also, humans consume more energy than the minimum (100\nW) required for life and reproduction. People in India use an average of 700 W per\nperson; it’s 10,000 W in the U.S. Both are still less than the 85,000 watts Watson uses.\nComputers can become more like us via neuromorphic computing, possibly a\nthousandfold. But human brains could get more efficient, too. The organoid brain-in-a-\nbottle could get closer to the 20 W limit. The idiosyncratic advantages of computers for\nmath, storage, and search, faculties of limited use to our ancestors, could be designed and\nevolved anew in labs.\n\nFacebook, the National Security Agency, and others are constructing exabyte-\nscale storage facilities at more than a megawatt and four hectares, while DNA can store\nthat amount in a milligram. Clearly, DNA is not a mature storage technology, but with\nMicrosoft and Technicolor doubling down on it, we would be wise to pay attention. The\nmain reason for the 6 trillion joules of energy required to get a productive human mind is\nthe twenty years required for training.\n\n168\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016388\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

If a boss asks for overtime “just this once,” he or she will expect it in the\nfuture.\n\nTime Consumers: Batch and Do Not Falter\n\nA schedule defends from chaos and whim.\n— ANNIE DILLARD, winner of Pulitzer Prize in nonfiction, 1975\n\nIF you have never used a commercial printer before, the pricing and lead times could surprise you.\n\nLet’s assume it costs $310 and takes one week to print 20 customized T-shirts with 4-color logos. How\nmuch and how long does it take to print 3 of the same T-shirt?\n\n$310 and one week.\n\nHow is that possible? Simple—the setup charges don’t change. It costs the printer the same amount in\nmaterials for plate preparation ($150) and the same in labor to man the press itself ($100). The setup is\nthe real time-consumer, and thus the job, despite its small size, needs to be scheduled just like the other,\nresulting in the same one-week delivery date. The lower economy of scale picks up the rest: The cost for\n3 shirts is $20 per shirt x 3 shirts instead of $3 per shirt x 20 shirts.\n\nThe cost- and time-effective solution, therefore, is to wait until you have a larger order, an approach\ncalled “batching.” Batching is also the solution to our distracting but necessary time consumers, those\nrepetitive tasks that interrupt the most important.\n\nIf you check mail and make bill payments five times a week, it might take 30 minutes per instance and\nyou respond to a total of 20 letters in two and a half hours. If you do this once per week instead, it might\ntake 60 minutes total and you still respond to a total of 20 letters. People do the former out of fear of\nemergencies. First, there are seldom real emergencies. Second, of the urgent communication you will\nreceive, missing a deadline is usually reversible and otherwise costs a minimum to correct.\n\nThere is an inescapable setup time for all tasks, large or minuscule in scale. It is often the same for one\nas it is for a hundred. There is a psychological switching of gears that can require up to 45 minutes to\n\nresume a major task that has been interrupted. More than a quarter of each 9-5 period (28%) is\nconsumed by such interruptions.\n\nThis is true of all recurring tasks and is precisely why we have already decided to check e-mail and\nphone calls twice per day at specific predetermined times (between which we let them accumulate).\n\nFrom mid-2004 to 2007, I checked mail no more than once a week, often not for up to four weeks at a\ntime. Nothing was irreparable, and nothing cost more than $300 to fix. This batching has saved me\nhundreds of hours of redundant work. How much is your time worth?\n\nLet’s use a hypothetical example:\n\n1. $20 per hour is how much you are paid or value your time.

I couldn’t pretend, however, that emotional engagement with new\nacquaintances, even with people I knew and liked but were not close friends,\nwas something that came naturally. And it is also true that from my first\nexperience of the world of numbers as a child on the kibbutz, and as I tackled\never more elaborate pieces on the piano, I did become aware of what might be\ncalled the upside of “a touch of Aspergers” — if that, indeed, is what it is. I was\nconscious of the ease with which my brain translated the complexities into\npictures in my mind. And the joy, at times, with which it allowed me to play\naround with, and develop, what I saw.\n\nBy the summer of 1967, I had experienced that feeling again, in my first real\nencounter with theoretical physics at Hebrew University. After the Six-Day\nWar, I began seriously contemplating a future as a research scientist, or perhaps\neventually a professor of physics. Two months after the war, I enrolled in a\nsummer program at the Weizmann Institute, Israel’s preeminent postgraduate\nresearch facility. Surrounded by some of the country’s, even the world’s,\nleading scientists, and by post-doctoral students determined to follow in their\nfootsteps, was intellectually enthralling. But it turned out to have another effect\non me as well. As I thought more and more about the prospect of joining their\nfraternity once I’d completed my undergraduate degree, I also heard them\ndescribe the way in which pure science sometimes got submerged in simple\nroutine, or, more discouragingly, in the politics and positioning and backbiting\nof the academic world.\n\nI think what finally changed my mind, however, was a feeling, nurtured on\nthe kibbutz but solidified by that many nights I’d spent leading sayeret\noperations across our borders, that I would find my true purpose in life trying to\nmake some special contribution to the future course of Israel. I did not for a\nmoment contemplate politics at that point. Instead, I thought of going back into\nthe military. I realized that in order to make a significant mark, if indeed I\ncould, would require me to serve in the regular army, not just an extraordinary\nunit like Sayeret Matkal. But I did hope that, at some stage, I’d be given the\nopportunity to finish my time in the sayeret as its commander, carrying on\nAvraham’s vision and, ideally, building and expanding on it as well. At least if\nthat part proved possible, I felt that, by comparison, a career in academia would\nbe somehow blinkered, and surely less fulfilling personally. My sayeret\nexperience had also taught me something else as well: that protecting Israel’s\nsecurity was not just a matter of muscle, or firepower, indispensible though they\n\n99\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011570\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I looked up the statistics, black kids in the US have slower cognitive development (and never catch\nup), which the study of course attributed to social factors without any evidence, and they had faster motor\ndevelopment! I suspect this means their brains are slower at learning high-level concepts, because the low-\nlevel structures are optimized for a shorter time. But they will keep the lead in motor development, because it\nis easier to learn, and they have more time and attention to practice once they get the structures in place.\n\nIt could also be that they have an additional set of learning directives in place that adapts them better to a\nmore hunting/running style of life, whereas the Europeans had to adapt for identifying long-term seasonal\npatterns, delayed gratification for agriculture etc.\n\nand CONCEPTS could be layer to layer communicaiton. . are gender differences also a matter of time ,\nand structure of interactions. .\n\nI suspect gender differences are mostly motivational, i.e. we have a reward system for all the different social\nand cognitive needs, which makes us receive different kinds of pleasure and pain, thereby pay attention and\nlearn. You cannot learn what does not attract your attention. Women tend to find abstract systems, conflicts\nand mechanisms intrinsically boring. Most women in computer science do not write programs because they\nenjoy solving puzzles, but because they want to help people, get approval etc. There are almost no women in\nmath, because it does not help people or yield social attention.\n\nMen tend to find elaborate social relations boring. If there is no pleasure in observing and empathizing with\npeople, one will not have good social cognition.\n\nIQ is not the only meaningful difference. Chinese pay an inordinate amount of attention to authority. I suspect\nhistorically., the authorities tended to kill them a lot if they did not. Jews tend be intellectually independent\nand anti-authoritarian, which might make them creative and inventive in ways that are hard to find in Asia.\n\nAt the moment, I think speed/quality of brain development plus motivational system are the key to\nunderstanding both mind and individual differences. Important part of human language might be the result in\na motivational need to discover/invent grammatical structure, which as a side effect makes us interested in\nmusic.\n\nIt would mean that Chomsky’s life long hypothesis, that people have a special circuit for grammatical\nlanguage, is wrong. They might be GENERAL learners, just like Gorillas, but with a strong motivational urge\nto build grammatical structure, which the brain simply invents (there are only a few ways in which a natural\nlanguage can work). That is much easier to wire into a brain than a specific circuit.\n\nimy self believe that african music, westrn music , chinese music are a window into the the structure of\nthose layers. . western rigid, african primitve , chinese nature based,.

These\ndisciplines view their linguistic transformation as the Causal Revolution. As Harvard\nsocial scientist Gary King puts it, “More has been learned about causal inference in the\nlast few decades than the sum total of everything that had been learned about it in all\nprior recorded history.”\n\nAs I contemplate the success of machine learning and try to extrapolate it to the\nfuture of AI, I ask myself, “Are we aware of the basic limitations that were discovered in\nthe causal-inference arena? Are we prepared to circumvent the theoretical impediments\nthat prevent us from going from one level of the hierarchy to another level?”\n\nI view machine learning as a tool to get us from data to probabilities. But then we\nstill have to make two extra steps to go from probabilities into real understandingnce—\ntwo big steps. One is to predict the effect of actions, and the second is counterfactual\nimagination. We cannot claim to understand reality unless we make the last two steps.\n\nIn his insightful book Foresight and Understanding (1961), the philosopher\nStephen Toulmin identified the transparency-versus-opacity contrast as the key to\nunderstanding the ancient rivalry between Greek and Babylonian sciences. According to\nToulmin, the Babylonian astronomers were masters of black-box predictions, far\nsurpassing their Greek rivals in accuracy and consistency of celestial observations. Yet\nScience favored the creative-speculative strategy of the Greek astronomers, which was\nwild with metaphorical imagery: circular tubes full of fire, small holes through which\ncelestial fire was visible as stars, and hemispherical Earth riding on turtleback. It was\nthis wild modeling strategy, not Babylonian extrapolation, that jolted Eratosthenes (276-\n194 BC) to perform one of the most creative experiments in the ancient world and\ncalculate the circumference of the Earth. Such an experiment would never have occurred\nto a Babylonian data-fitter.\n\nModel-blind approaches impose intrinsic limitations on the cognitive tasks that\nStrong Al can perform. My general conclusion is that human-level AI cannot emerge\nsolely from model-blind learning machines; it requires the symbiotic collaboration of\ndata and models.\n\nData science is a science only to the extent that it facilitates the interpretation of\ndata—a two-body problem, connecting data to reality.

Laffer, Ph.D.\nSummary\nTo save you the agony of plodding through this fascinating, information-rich paper, I’ll get straight to the point: Donald Trump\nwill be the next President of the United States after having won an easy victory over Hillary Clinton in November 2016. The\nreasons:\nI.)\nII.)\nIII.)\nSection one shows that the essential characteristics of the narrative for the Trump campaign and the Reagan campaign\nof 1980 are surprisingly similar, which would point to a Trump landslide.\nSection two describes the poor state of the current economy using detrended GDP per adult, the ratio of employmentto-adult-population\nand new home sales per 1,000 adults and how these measures strongly indicate a Republican\nvictory.\nUsing historical data for the Gallup poll question “are you satisfied” and presidential election dates, this section would\npoint to an overwhelming Republican win in November 2016.\nIV.) Relying on voter turnout data this year versus earlier years and party selection, the Republicans have a large advantage\ncoming into the Fall election.\nV.)\nBasing our forecast on the past eight years of Congressional elections—House and Senate—as well as state elections\nof house, senate and governors, the Republicans should be exceedingly confident about the upcoming presidential\nelection.\nVI.) Taking careful measure of what both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have done in the public eye, Trump has the\nissues on his side.\nI. 1979-1980 How the Reagan Revolution Began\nIn early 1979, a group of Ronald Reagan acolytes—some 10 to 15 in total—got together in Justin Dart’s office at Rexall (the\ncorner of La Cienega and Beverly) and there they formed the original Reagan Executive Advisory Committee. With very few\nexceptions (initially only me), this group had been called Reagan’s Kitchen Cabinet. Those present and those also invited\nincluded Justin Dart, Holmes Tuttle, Jack Wrather, Bill French Smith, Bill Wilson, Earle Jorgensen, Ben Biaggini, Ted\nCummings, Alfred Bloomingdale, Charles Wick, Henry Salvatori et moi. I was the youngest of the group by three decades.\nAnd, in fact, the only way Justin Dart could convince the others to let me be a member was that they needed someone to keep\nthe minutes of the meetings, i.e. as a secretary. In speaking with a reporter about the Kitchen Cabinet, here’s what Jus Dart\nhad to say: “In addressing the question of how many of Reagan's friends actually qualify as members, Dart said: ‘Damn fewer\nthan is generally advertised.’” 1 That just says it all.\nThe purpose of this committee was to provide guidance and support to the emerging presidential candidacy of one Ronald\nReagan. The members were to a person close, close, close friends and supporters of Ronald Reagan or husbands of Nancy\nReagan’s best friends. And the race for the White House began.\nDuring this pre-primary and primary process, Ronald Reagan was disrespected and abused by a significant segment of the\nRepublican establishment. 2 He was called an empty suit, a trigger-happy California cowboy, only an actor, a person who\nspoke words others wrote, a racist, a bigot, a divorcée, a war monger and the man who would start the Third World War. My\nfavorite slur came from none other than the Democratic Party’s “éminence grise” Clark Clifford, 3 who referred to Ronald\nReagan as an “amiable dunce.” The torrent of anti-Reagan epithets never stopped.\n1\n“Industrialist Justin Dart has declared President Reagan's 'kitchen cabinet',” United Press International, March 26, 1981.\nhttp://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/26/Industrialist-Justin-Dart-has-declared-President-Reagans-kitchen-cabinet/4240354430800/\n2\nThere is a display at the Young Americans Foundation in Santa Barbara of a number of these anti-Reagan videos by any number of Republican and\nDemocratic stalwarts.\n3\nAs if receiving divine retribution for his nasty ways, Clark Clifford, who served as Secretary of Defense for President Johnson and as an advisor to\nPresidents Truman, Kennedy and Carter, was indicted in the early 1990s on charges of conspiracy, fraud and bribery surrounding the Bank of Credit\nand Commerce International scandal.\nFor more, see: http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/11/us/clark-clifford-a-major-adviser-to-four-presidents-is-dead-at-91.html?pagewanted=all\n103 Murphy Court, Nashville, TN 37203 (615) 460-0100 FAX (615) 460-0102\nLaffer Associates Game On [Updated 7/6/2016]\nIn fact, the whole group of us received virtually no support from the Republican Party or the Party’s elders. It wasn’t until\nReagan had finally defeated George Bush, along with John Connally, Howard Baker, Phil Crane, Bob Dole and John Anderson\nin the primary race, that there was any attempt to be conciliatory to Ronald Reagan’s presidential campaign by the Republican\npowers that were. Even Barry Goldwater, whose career owed so much to Ronald Reagan, was cool at best to a Reagan\npresidency.\nI remember one post-Bush-defeat meeting of our committee when we had already secured the nomination and George Herbert\nWalker Bush sat next to me and lightly apologized for referring to me as the “Voo-Doo Economist.” In truth, I had sort of\nenjoyed the handle, and told H.W. Bush that I was delighted he finally had come to join us because I needed some fellow\nYalies to up the quality of our group. He laughed.\nThings had been so vitriolic and bad during the primary campaign that a number of Republicans couldn’t in clear conscience\nsupport Ronald Reagan at all and others could only support him in name only. And one of the primary contestants, John\nAnderson, Republican Congressman from Illinois, was so offended by Ronald Reagan’s nomination that he decided to run as\nan independent in the general election, which he did. While, in hindsight, John Anderson’s decision may now seem like a nonevent,\nit sure wasn’t seen as a frivolous gesture back then. Ronald Reagan looked like a sure loser with both a moderate\nRepublican opponent and a sitting Democratic President, with all the privilege, prestige and power that the Office of the\nPresident holds.\nAt the convention in Detroit City, I testified before the platform committee on what I thought Reaganomics would be—which\nwas lots of fun. But, the real drama occurred when it came time to select Ronald Reagan’s running mate. Showing no signs\nof remorse or respect for the primary voters, the Party’s establishment conspired to browbeat Ronald Reagan into accepting\nGerald Ford as Ronald Reagan’s co-president running mate. They—the establishment—were absolutely certain that Ronald\nReagan would be blown away by Carter in November of 1980 and that the down ticket Republican candidates would get their\nlunch handed to them. So much for the wisdom of Republican elders and insiders.\nIn other words, just like today in re Donald Trump, the party’s cognoscenti were forecasting a huge Reagan defeat that would\ncarry with it large numbers of House members and Senators. Reagan, they thought, would prove to be more devastating to\nRepublicans than either the Goldwater defeat of 1964 or the Ford defeat of 1976.\nAs you all know, none of this happened. We handily defeated Carter, even though we were behind in the polls as recently as\n1 week before the election. 4 Reagan took 44 states and 50.7% of the popular vote to Carter’s 41% of the vote and Anderson’s\n6.6% of the vote. Whodathunkit? I’m naturally an optimist, but I’ve never been more optimistic than I am today or than I was\nin 1980, and I’ve never had more fun than I had in the several years before Ronald Reagan’s election. The Reagan saga of\n1980 seems a lot like the Trump story today.\nII. “It’s the Economy Stupid” – James Carville 1992\nIn the 2016 primaries, each and every Republican candidate promised lower tax rates, restrained government spending, sound\nmoney and greatly lessened regulations. The mantra was repeal “Obamacare,” eviscerate Dodd-Frank and cut taxes. There\ncouldn’t have been a more supply-side, pro-growth field of candidates assembled in the entire history of our nation—not one\noutlier. It almost became a Republican feeding frenzy as to who could propose the lowest tax rate and create the most growth.\nDebates on economic issues were super boring and hyperbole as to who could be the most pro-growth supply sider infused\nthe air we breathe. In truth, every Republican, from Jim Gilmore to Donald Trump, understood that America was in free fall\nand needed a huge dose of incentive alignments. There was very little room for debate on the issues because the candidates\nall agreed with each other.\nThe Democrats, once O’Malley, Webb and Chafee exited stage left, were pulling each other further and further to the “Free\nLunch Tax the Rich” ticket. Already way over-subsidized, students were promised free college by Sanders, and America would\nhave a $15 federal minimum wage everywhere. And then there was expanded free health care, huge tax increases on Wall\nStreet exploiters and on the rich in general. The Walton family was singled out as the perfect example of what’s wrong with\nAmerica: one family whose net worth was close to $150 billion and whose legacy company, Walmart, paid workers’ wages so\nlow that full-time employees qualified for welfare. The Democrats defined their enemies as the most successful innovators,\ninvestors, job-creators and employers in America.\nThe Democrats also, in their never-ending debates, careened further and further toward “from each according to his ability and\nto each according to his need” paradise. The most enthusiastic crowds were energized by the endearing, wild-eyed,\nseptuagenarian Socialist whose unkempt, long white hair became emblematic of “enough is enough already”: Uncle Bernie\nSanders. Who doesn’t love Bernie Sanders? Or, as his throngs of acolytes scream, who doesn’t “feel the Bern?”\n4\nReagan’s surge in polls is generally attributed to the presidential debate held one week before the election took place, on October 28 th , immediately\nafter which Reagan appears to have moved into a 3 point lead. See: Lydia Saad, “Late Upsets Are Rare, but Have Happened,” Gallup, October 27,\n2008. http://www.gallup.com/poll/111451/late-upsets-rare-happened.aspx\n2\n1950\n1954\n1958\n1962\n1966\n1970\n1974\n1978\n1982\n1986\n1990\n1994\n1998\n2002\n2006\n2010\n2014\nLaffer Associates Game On [Updated 7/6/2016]\nHillary’s and Bernie’s kabuki dance is far from over. The continued Sanders’ humiliation and exposé of Clinton is profoundly\ndamaging to the Democrats’ prospects, while the Republicans have just chosen their candidate. Someone ought to tell that\nto Bill Kristol.\nWhat is patently obvious from the rise of Bernie Sanders and the massive, hard fought battle in the Republican primary is that\neconomic discontent is at an all-time high. The electorate wants economic change NOW.\nBut, then there’s Hillary Clinton’s take on the economy and the Obama record. Like Pat Buchanan’s protectionist niche some\n20 years ago, there is a segment of America that truly likes the Obama record. But, that segment is not even close to being\nlarge enough to elect a winner.\nHillary Clinton’s political and academic credentials are second to none—Wellesley undergraduate, Yale Law School,\nWatergate trial activist, Rose Law firm lawyer, First Lady, Senator from New York, and President Obama’s Secretary of State.\nShe has been indefatigably toiling her way through the political superstructure to be the next President of the United States:\nthe incarnation of an Obama third term and protector of the Obama legacy. This tack that she has taken is helpful in the\nDemocratic primary, especially among African Americans, but is a very large mistake in a general election and reflects poorly\non her political judgement.\nJudging from the three most important metrics of the economy: i.) detrended real nondefense GDP per adult from 1950 to the\npresent, ii.) employment as a share of adult population during the post-World War II period, and iii.) new housing sales per\n1,000 adults over the past 55 years, anyone who runs on the Obama record is at a great, great, great disadvantage.\nJust look at each of these three measures of economic performance:\n30%\n26%\n22%\nEisenhower I\nEisenhower II\nKennedy\nJohnson\nFigure 1\nReal Nondefense GDP Per Adult Detrended 5\n(quarterly, 1Q-50 to 4Q-15)\nNixon I\nNixon II\nCarter\nReagan I\nReagan II\nH.W.

Thus, given that detrended real nondefense GDP per adult as\na measure of our country’s economic performance has ended on very low notes for Obama, “W” Bush and Bush Sr., it is clear\n5\nNote: the gray vertical lines in figures throughout this paper represent the election dates of these individual presidents. The reason for this (rather\nthan placing vertical lines on inauguration dates) is that we’re using economic metrics throughout this paper as indicators of votes rather than as\ndescriptors for the success or failure of presidential policies.\n3\nJan-48\nJan-50\nJan-52\nJan-54\nJan-56\nJan-58\nJan-60\nJan-62\nJan-64\nJan-66\nJan-68\nJan-70\nJan-72\nJan-74\nJan-76\nJan-78\nJan-80\nJan-82\nJan-84\nJan-86\nJan-88\nJan-90\nJan-92\nJan-94\nJan-96\nJan-98\nJan-00\nJan-02\nJan-04\nJan-06\nJan-08\nJan-10\nJan-12\nJan-14\nJan-16\nLaffer Associates Game On [Updated 7/6/2016]\nthat the economy is shouting for a party change. This does not bode well for the Democratic Party, which continues to endorse\nthe current status quo.\nAnd to confirm GDP growth’s implications, we also have the disappointing measure of employment to adult population. Again,\nthere is every reason on Earth to change parties now. There literally has been no Obama recovery, and Hillary Clinton\npromises she’ll do more of the same. The U.S. has about 10 million fewer jobs per year than we would have had if the ratio\nof employment to adult population were what it was in mid-2000.\nJust compare the ascent of the employment to adult population ratio for the eight years of Obama to the Johnson years, or\neven to the Nixon years, and especially to the Reagan and Clinton years. This Obama economy really isn’t a recovery, let\nalone a strong recovery, as one would expect should have happened following the devastating collapse of the Great\nRecession. Why would Hillary Clinton want to run on the Obama record? It’s beyond me.\n65\n64\n63\nEisenhower I\nEisenhower II\nKennedy\nJohnson\nFigure 2\nCivilian Employment-to-Population Ratio\n(monthly, Jan-48 to Mar-16, percentage points)\nNixon I\nNixon II\nCarter\nReagan I\nReagan II\nH.W.

Both of these elections appear to have had very strong extraneous factors at work. For Nixon’s success, the huge\noutrage against Johnson’s handling of the Vietnam War could well have overpowered the seemingly good economy and for\nObama in 2012 a high racial sensitivity quotient could also have tipped the scales. If anything, today the war and racial\nsensitivity issues operate against the Democrats.\nWhat I beg you to look at carefully are the virtually identical precipitous drops in the economy immediately preceding the\nPresidencies of Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama and the totally opposite results during their respective Presidencies. I just\ncan’t see how a pro-Obama candidate can win in 2016.\n4\nLaffer Associates Game On [Updated 7/6/2016]\nAnd, of course, without a housing recovery, there can’t be prosperity, and, as shown in Figure 3 below, there is very little\nprospect for a housing recovery anytime soon.\n20\n18\n16\n14\nKennedy\nJohnson\nNixon I\nNixon II\nFigure 3\nNew Home Sales per 1,000 Adults\n(monthly, single-family homes, SAAR, Jan-60 to Mar-16)\nCarter\nReagan I\nReagan II\nH.W.

To be fair, the decline began when “W” took office and accelerated greatly when Bush, aided by Geithner and\nBernanke, bailed everyone out and spent huge sums of U.S. resources trying to stimulate the economy—all to no avail. To\nme, the circumstances today are almost identical to those of 1980—16 years of bad economics about to be followed by a\npolitical renaissance.\nFor Hillary Clinton, the Obama record on the economy will be her biggest negative come November. And the very fact that\nshe actually sought out and embraces this legacy speaks volumes about her judgement.\nIII. All Elections are Referenda on Incumbents\nThe Mood of the Country – The History of the Gallup Poll\nWhether fair or not, Hillary Clinton is viewed as a Democratic insider and establishment regular. As such, she benefits greatly\nin her ability to raise money and attract superdelegate support. But, there’s also a downside to being a Democratic insider\nand establishment regular today. When the electorate is unhappy with the direction the country is heading, she’ll also be\nblamed right along with the President and other members of his party. This is exactly what happened to the Presidencies of\nJohnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Bush Sr., Bush “W” and presumptively Obama.\nIf any one of you remembers the contested Democratic primary of 1980 when Senator Ted Kennedy challenged his party’s\nsitting President, you will be reminded of the current Democratic primary where Bernie Sanders continues to humiliate Hillary\nClinton, primary after primary. While Senator Kennedy lost in his quest to secure the Democratic nomination, he clearly\nexposed all the weaknesses of President Carter, just as Senator Bernie Sanders is exposing Hilary Clinton’s vulnerability.\nThis can’t be good news for Mrs. Clinton.\nFor quite some time now, I have been using the Gallup poll question, “Are you satisfied with the way things are going?” as my\nmeasure of the electorate’s level of discontent. This question has been posed by Gallup for years and years and, thus, the\n5\n1979\n1980\n1981\n1982\n1983\n1984\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\nLaffer Associates Game On [Updated 7/6/2016]\nelectorate’s response to this question reflects a consistent indicator over a long period of time: in fact, long enough for us to\nget a sense of whether this measure is a reliable guide to help forecast election results (see Figure 4). It is:\nIn my paper “Senate Outlook” of October 2, 2014, I relied heavily on this Gallup question to arrive at my outlandish forecast of\na seven seat gain for the Republicans in that year’s Senate races. My forecast of a seven seat pickup was probably the most\noptimistic forecast at the time for the Republicans. But, as it turned out, I was off by two! The Republicans actually picked up\nnine seats—West Virginia, Montana, South Dakota, Arkansas, Alaska, Louisiana, Iowa, North Carolina and Colorado—and\nlost none.\n100%\n90%\n80%\n70%\nFigure 4\nThe Gallup “Are You Satisfied?” Survey\n(Feb 2-5, 1979 through Feb 3-7, 2016)\nIn general, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the way things are going in the United States at this\ntime?

Both of\nReagan elections were right in sync with Gallup’s poll survey at November of 1980 and November of 1984. Likewise, Bush\nSenior’s election in November of 1988 was seen as Reagan’s third term and was foreseen by the Gallup poll question.\nAnd then both Clinton elections were right in line with the survey results from the Gallup poll questions in November of 1992\nand November of 1996.\nBush the younger’s election in 2000 is anomalous, but his reelection in 2004 is consistent with the measure as was McCain’s\n(really it was Bush’s) defeat in November 2008. The 2012 election also appears contrary to the survey response to the poll\nquestion. If this poll reestablishes its predictive power in 2016, Trump wins in a Reagan-like landslide.\nIV. Primary Colors\nWhile perhaps subtle, what happens in contested presidential primaries is also a harbinger of general elections. And if the\ncurrent Democratic and Republican primaries are accurate measures of voter enthusiasm, the Democrats are facing a tough\nup-hill fight against Republicans to say the least.\nUsing only states with party primaries, i.e. not state caucuses, and only party primaries up to the time when Donald Trump\nbecame the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, which was following the May 3 rd Indiana primary, there has been\na large increase in voter turnout for the Republicans in 2016 when compared to either 2008 or 2012. In fact, in the 28 state\nprimaries through May 3 rd , the total number of Republicans who actually voted in those primaries has increased by 57.2% over\n2008 and 67.1% over 2012 (see Table 1 on page 8). And, using unweighted state numbers, the 2016 Republican primary\n6\nLaffer Associates Game On [Updated 7/6/2016]\nvoter turnout is up 66.6% over 2008 and 103.0% over 2012. I use both total turnout as well as equal weighted state turnout\nbecause our Electoral College system for selecting a president is a combination of both. These numbers are astounding and\nby themselves speak volumes for Republican prospects in 2016. And it is not just the Trump phenomenon; it’s the Trump\nphenomenon plus much more.\nBut, the situation is worse for Democrats. When juxtaposed to the Democratic turnout in 2008 and 2016, the 2016 Republican\nturnout looks even stronger. Remember, the 2012 Democratic primary was a non-event because President Obama, then a\nsitting President, was running for nomination essentially uncontested. We therefore focus exclusively on the change from the\n2008 to the 2016 Democratic Party turnout, which, using the same states, is down in total by 20.1%. And, using equal-weighted\nstate numbers, it’s down by 16.2%. On a state-by-state comparison, Republican turnout is way up, and Democratic turnout is\nway down. Someone should ring the Democratic alarm bell.\nAnd, even head-to-head comparisons of absolute voter turnout between the Democratic and Republican primaries in 2016\nand 2008 give the Republicans a definite edge for the elections of 2016 and an enormous increase over 2008. So far in 2016,\nthere have been 3.5 million more Republicans voting in their party’s primaries than there have been Democrats. In 2008, the\nDemocrats had over 11.3 million additional primary voter advantage over their Republican counterparts. This enormous\nincrease in Republican voter turnout over Democrats in 2016 plus the fact that there are more Republican voters in 2016 than\nDemocratic voters should be perhaps the single most disturbing statistic if you are a Hillary supporter, especially given the\nexceptional enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders in what has turned out to be a down primary turnout for Democrats.\nEven on a state-by-state basis, the flip from Democrat to Republican has been pronounced. So far in this 2016 primary season,\nthere are 14 new states that had Republican turnout in excess of Democratic turnout, i.e. those states in 2008 had more\nDemocratic turnout than Republican turnout, while in 2016 Republican turnout exceeds Democratic turnout. These states are\nnot, as Bernie Sanders would say, “chopped liver.” They include Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New\nHampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. When it comes to\nthe electoral college, flipping a state is far more important than is increasing the margin of victory.\nWhat should be even more alarming to the Democrats than the party flip against Democrats in the 14 states that have already\nhad primaries is the fact that so far in every state, save Michigan, Democratic voter advantage over Republican’s has declined.\nAnd Michigan, without trying to reach too far for excuses, appears to hinge on the tragedy of the Flint water contamination and\nMitt Romney’s candidacy in 2008 and 2012. And so as not to take everything away from the unique Michigan phenomenon,\nit still must be remembered that in both 2008 and 2016, Republican primary turnout in Michigan was greater than Democratic\nturnout.\n7\nLaffer Associates Game On [Updated 7/6/2016]\nTable 1\nPrimaries Completed as of May 3 rd\nRepublican Primary Turn Out % Increase\n2016 from\n% Increase\n2016 from\nDemocrat

Politics in the U.S. Congress\nIn January 2009, there were 57 Democrats in the U.S. Senate, 2 Independents (Sanders VT and King ME) who always voted\nwith and caucused with the Democrats, and 41 Republicans. Today, there are 54 Republicans, 44 Democrats plus the same\n2 Independents who are effectively Democrats (see Table 5 below).\nLikewise, in January 2009, there were 257 Democrats in the U.S. House and 178 Republicans. Today, the tables have turned\nand the Republicans have their largest majority in the House since 1928, 247, and the Democrats have 188 House members.\nNot only have the numbers changed dramatically, but the ideologies have also become more concentrated. The changes in\nthe U.S. Congress over the past eight years are huge and reflect an enormous swing in U.S. political sentiments.

Politics in the States\nIn the state legislatures, the changes in the Democrat/Republican split have been equally as radical as they are in the U.S.\nCongress. Counting all senate members of the various state legislatures in 2009, there were 1,024 Democrats, 889\nRepublicans and 58 categorized as “other.” (See Table 6 below). But today, the Democrats have only 827 State Senators,\nthe Republicans 1,088, with 57 categorized as other—this is the very definition of a 180 degree turn around.\nIn the state houses of representatives in 2009, Democrats had 3,058 members to the Republicans’ tally of 2,334 with 19\n“others.” And yet, today, the Republicans control the vast majority of state houses with a grand total of 3,037 house members\nto the Democrats’ 2,342 members and 32 “others.” This switch in state legislatures all but assures the Republican control of\nredistricting and control of the U.S. House for years to come.\nAs a final sort of “egg in your beer,” the Democrats had 28 governors to the Republicans’ 22 in 2009. Today there are 31\nRepublican governors, 18 Democrats and one “other” Bill Walker (I) in Alaska. With solid control of both houses and the\ngovernorships of so many states, a united Republican Party could do almost anything it wants to do if it has the will to do it,\nand, at the state level, the party is following through.\n11\nLaffer Associates Game On [Updated 7/6/2016]\nTable 6\nMembership of State Houses, Senates and Governorships by Party\n(biannual: 1976-1998, annual: 2000-2016)\nState Senate Count State House Count Governor Count\nDemocrat Republican Other Democrat Republican Other Democrat Republican Ind.\n1976 1306 618 8 3772 1783 26 36 13 1\n1977 37 12 1\n1978 1260 669 3 3454 2027 20 37 12 1\n1979 32 18 0\n1980 1182 742 8 3289 2190 22 31 19 0\n1981 27 23 0\n1982 1210 725 2 3429 2006 17 27 23 0\n1983 34 16 0\n1984 1187 753 6 3136 2316 14 35 15 0\n1985 34 16 0\n1986 1177 762 7 3294 2164 9 34 16 0\n1987 26 24 0\n1988 1192 751 3 3277 2176 13 27 23 0\n1989 28 22 0\n1990 1186 757 3 3242 2202 23 29 21 0\n1991 29 19 2\n1992 1132 799 4 3186 2223 31 28 20 2\n1993 30 18 2\n1994 1021 905 3 2817 2603 31 29 19 2\n1995 19 30 1\n1996 998 931 9 2886 2539 31 18 31 1\n1997 17 32 1\n1998 1041 963 3 2903 2580 0 17 32 1\n1999 17 31 2\n2000 995 931 11 2818 2600 21 17 31 2\n2001 990 932 13 2809 2604 14 21 27 2\n2002 939 974 58 2694 2687 30 21 27 2\n2003 941 977 4 2700 2693 18 24 26 0\n2004 950 967 53 2686 2689 21 22 28 0\n2005 951 963 8 2704 2683 24 22 28 0\n2006 952 964 6 2702 2675 34 22 28 0\n2007 1010 909 3 2971 2422 18 28 22 0\n2008 1020 898 4 2985 2403 24 28 22 0\n2009 1021 890 11 3041 2346 24 28 22 0\n2010 1026 893 3 3028 2356 27 26 24 0\n2011 881 1032 9 2453 2924 36 20 29 1\n2012 873 1040 57 2441 2939 31 20 29 1\n2013 889 1022 61 2592 2791 28 19 30 1\n2014 876 1034 62 2572 2802 37 21 29 0\n2015 821 1087 64 2342 3024 45 18 31 1\n2016 827 1088 57 2342 3037 32 18 31 1\nSource: 2016-2016: NCSL, numbers are as of January for each year; 1976-2012: Census Bureau, numbers are as of March for each year\n12\n1976\n1979\n1982\n1985\n1988\n1991\n1994\n1997\n2000\n2003\n2006\n2009\n2012\n2015\nGovernors\nState Senate\nState House\nLaffer Associates Game On [Updated 7/6/2016]\nTo put substance into the predictive power of state and local election results for presidential elections, I have graphically\naligned state house results for all states with state senate results for all states and gubernatorial results for all states by year.\n3800\n3500\nCarter\nFigure 7\nState House, Senate, and Governorships\n(1976-1998: biannual, 2000-2016: annual)\nReagan I\nReagan II\nH.W.

Issues and Political History\nAnother factor favoring Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton has to do with longevity and negative selection. The political\nprocess, more than any system I’ve ever worked with, thrives on pointing out mistakes and overlooking successes. My advice\nto many candidates has been to speak as little as possible and to describe policies in as general a manner as you can get\naway with. People aren’t looking through your transcripts to find the next wonderful and positive thing you’ve done, but instead\nthey try to find your missteps, transgressions, faux pas and failures. Politics is a totally negative process. You live or die by\nthe sum total of what you’ve done wrong, not on the balance between what you’ve done right and what you’ve done wrong.\nIn the words of Shakespeare, “the good is oft interred with their bones.” 6\nTrump has had very limited exposure as a practicing politician and, therefore, has only his own words and phrases to criticize.\nWhile he may have a number of missteps in business or in his personal life, no one cares. And yet, he truly enjoys celebrity\nstatus as no one in politics today does. Also, given how much Trump has said about any number of issues over the past couple\nof years, there are probably quotes that can be used on any side of most any issue. But with Hillary, it’s different.\nHillary has done a lot. She’s been involved in politics at a visible level since the Watergate hearings and maybe even earlier.\nHer past contains numerous misdeeds and failures as much because she’s done so much and perhaps not so much because\nshe has been a failure. Yet, a diligent, hard-driving researcher can find a laundry list of her significant misdeeds.\nTo wit,\n� As events have unfolded, her vote in favor of the Iraq War is a clear sign of poor political judgment, especially in her party.\n� Her behavior surrounding the attack on the consulate in Benghazi and the failure to respond to four American deaths sure\nlooks like a case of poor judgment.\n� Her use of a private e-mail server while Secretary of State and thus the potential exposure of critical U.S. intelligence to\nthose who would do us harm again smacks of poor judgement.\n� The Clinton Foundation along with its big gifts and extraordinarily large speaking fees surely creates an aura of impropriety,\nfavoritism and the absence of sound judgement.\n� Her involvement in the cover-up of Fast and Furious is transparent bad judgment.\n� Her disregard for coal miners and coal companies in her reckless quest to be seen as a defender of the environment is yet\nanother case of dangerous judgement.\n� The IRS scandal: While not directly implicated as a participant in an administration cover-up of the Cincinnati IRS office\nheaded by Lois Lerner’s misuse of government power, there are definite indications of her gross negligence in the pursuit\nof even-handed fairness of the power to tax.\n� As I have predicted, 7 Obamacare has not only driven considerable premium increases for coverage since 2013, when the\nmarketplace first opened for enrollment, but has also added significant cost burdens onto health insurance companies,\nmany of whom are choosing to leave the Obamacare marketplace as costs continue to outpace profits. This has led to\nentire states, such as Alaska and Alabama, being left with only one insurer on their respective Obamacare marketplaces,\nwith 650 counties total being left with just one insurer in 2017. 8\n� Her personal investments in cattle futures. 9 In the late 1970s, she turned an initial investment of $1,000 into $100,000 in\njust 10 months, despite having no previous investment experience. Her close friend, James Blair, an experienced\ncommodities trader, advised her to enter the commodities market, but Clinton claimed to have made her own investment\ndecisions. One academic study published in The Journal of Economics and Finance estimated the likelihood of achieving\na result such as Clinton’s as 1 in 31 trillion. 10\n6\nWilliam Shakespeare, The Tragedy of Julius Caesar, Act III, Scene 2, Line 1620.\n7\nArthur B.

Many\nobstacles and some innovations can be anticipated, but more cannot. In my own work\nwith experimentalists on building quantum computers, I typically find that some of the\ntechnological steps I expect to be easy turn out to be impossible, whereas some of the\ntasks I imagine to be impossible turn out to be easy. You don’t know until you try.\n\nIn the 1950s, partly inspired by conversations with Wiener, John von Neumann\nintroduced the notion of the “technological singularity.” Technologies tend to improve\nexponentially, doubling in power or sensitivity over some interval of time. (For\nexample, since 1950, computer technologies have been doubling in power roughly\nevery two years, an observation enshrined as Moore’s Law.) Von Neumann\nextrapolated from the observed exponential rate of technological improvement to\npredict that “technological progress will become incomprehensively rapid and\ncomplicated,” outstripping human capabilities in the not too distant future. Indeed, if\none extrapolates the growth of raw computing power—expressed in terms of bits and\nbit flips—into the future at its current rate, computers should match human brains\nsometime in the next two to four decades (depending on how one estimates the\ninformation-processing power of human brains).\n\nThe failure of the initial overly optimistic predictions of AI dampened talk about\nthe technological singularity for a few decades, but since the 2005 publication of Ray\nKurzweil’s The Singularity is Near, the idea of technological advance leading to\nsuperintelligence is back in force. Some believers, Kurzweil included, regard this\nsingularity as an opportunity: Humans can merge their brains with the\nsuperintelligence and thereby live forever. Others, such as Stephen Hawking and Elon\nMusk, worried that this superintelligence would prove to be malign and regarded it as\nthe greatest existing threat to human civilization. Still others, including some of the\ncontributors to the present volume, think such talk is overblown.\n\nWiener’s life work and his failure to predict its consequences are intimately\nbound up in the idea of an impending technological singularity. His work on\nneuroscience and his initial support of McCulloch and Pitts adumbrated the startlingly\neffective deep-learning methods of the present day. Over the past decade, and\nparticularly in the last five years, such deep-learning techniques have finally exhibited\nwhat Wiener liked to call Gestalt—for example, the ability to recognize that a circle is\na circle even if when slanted sideways it looks like an ellipse. His work on control,\ncombined with his work on neuromuscular feedback, was significant for the\ndevelopment of robotics and is the inspiration for neural-based human/machine\ninterfaces. His lapses in technological prediction, however, suggest that we should\ntake the notion of a technological singularity with a grain of salt. The general\ndifficulties of technological prediction and the problems specific to the development of\na superintelligence should warn us against overestimating both the power and the\nefficacy of information processing.\n\nThe Arguments for Singularity Skepticism\nNo exponential increase lasts forever.

(Your book, United in Hate,\ndescribes this addiction to hate in detail.\n\nThe key to the Inner Jihad is to learn to transfer responsibility for our Islamic Enemy’s hate and resultant\nactions back to it and take responsibility back for our own situation. We must learn all we can about the enemy.\nWe must unwind our inappropriate projections and introjections and rediscover who we are and are not. We\nmust speak up. We must support those Muslims who promote expressions of Islam that are consistent with our\nprinciples. And we must stalk the C ontrol Factor, constantly be on guard for its intrusion. This is an individual\nendeavor as each of our Control Factors uses its own methods. The book gives plenty of examples of each\nmaneuver discussed but it is important for each of us to discover the unique workings of his own mind. That\ntakes the work of the Inner Jihad.\n\nFP: Share with our readers what you mean by the “Turnaround Moment.”\n\nSiegel: There is a moment in typical horror films where the central characters have been pushed to their limit.\nThey then change and fully embrace the willingness to be as ruthless as the threat they face. No more moral\nhigh ground; no more futile attempts to ignore or change the threat’s essence. As Lee Harris described in The\nSuicide of Reason, it is the willingness o r license to be (not necessarily actually being) as ruthless that is\ncritical. It is a mental state that sheds all the prior counter-productive efforts at denial to finally clearly focus on\nthe threat faced. Part of the Inner Jihad is to reach that Turnaround Moment sooner rather than later.\n\nFP: You suggest that “mirroring” should be used as part of our arsenal. Tell us about it.\n\nSiegel: Mirroring is a literal approach to transferring back to the addict responsibility that we have been\ninappropriately accepting. Critical to the addict/enabler relationship is asymmetry. Like the addict, the enemy\nuses a less limiting set of rules than we do. The enemy typically initiates aggression while we respond only.\nMirroring means that we demonstrate our willingness to act symmetrically, to be governed by the same rules. It\nis stunning how much is accomplished when one’s attitude simply is clear that he will do what is necessary;\noften not much else is needed as the addict or enemy realizes the game is fundamentally changed. But other\ntimes action is absolutely needed. Demonstrating that we are not afraid to treat the enemy as it treats us carries\ngreat meaning. Imagine (international law aside) if Israel announced that from now on it will mirror Hamas\nsuch that if civilian populations are targeted by bombs from Gaza, Israel will do the same (it is accused of such\nanyway). The population might finally rethink and take responsibility for its privilege of voting its leaders. As\nstated earlier, all behavior is instructive and when we mirror we teach the other the effects of his behavior.\n\nConversely, some situations demand that we assert asymmetry; those cases where it is necessary to highlight\nour differences with the enemy. Just this week, an disingenuous report was issued by an NGO drawing an\nequivalence between Palestinian and Israe li schoolbooks claiming that both sides have their relativistic “ «\nnarratives.” Yet, as the Palestinian Media Watch’s website has demonstrated for years, there is nothing in the\nWest anywhere comparable to the hatred spewed daily by the Palestinian Authority, including through its\neducation system. It is interesting to note that while the US State Department initially funded the “study,”- in\nwhat appears to be an attempt to sanitize the PA’s record so that the US can continue to fund the PA against the\nspirit of US law- Hillary Clinton has a difficult time escaping her conclusion as Senator in 2007 that these\nschoolbooks along with other media “profoundly poison(s) the minds of these children.” It is most important\nthat we do not succumb to this type of use of symmetry that distorts the profound differences between us and\nthe enemy.\n\nEssentially, we are not clear as a nation, participating in a world with international rules, how to bes t fight this\nenemy. The first act of any rehab is to acknowledge that we do not know how nor are we yet competent to\n\nstop our addictions. This is not a book about policy. In fact, the “right” policies are unlikely to emerge until a\ncritical mass has meaningfully dealt with their Control Factors and share a common perspective. We like to look\nat our history and assume a single perspective throughout but the truth is that we had to learn how to respond to\nPearl Harbor, the Nazis, the Cold War etc. The same applies here. Our press promotes “elites” who are tasked\nwith acting as if they possess the “true wisdom” to deal with our threats but the truth is we do not know nor are\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024390\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It’s about building a system to\nreplace yourself.\n\nThis is the first exercise.\n\nEven if you have no intention of becoming an entrepreneur, this is the ultimate continuation of our\n80/20 and elimination process: Preparing someone to replace you (even if it never happens) will produce\nan ultrarefined set of rules that will cut remaining fat and redundancy from your schedule. Lingering\nunimportant tasks will disappear as soon as someone else is being paid to do them.\n\nBut what about the cost?\n\nThis is a hurdle that is hard for most. If I can do it better than an assistant, why should I pay them at\nall? Because the goal is to free your time to focus on bigger and better things.\n\nThis chapter is a low-cost exercise to get you past this lifestyle limiter. It is absolutely necessary that\nyou realize that you can always do something more cheaply yourself. This doesn’t mean you want to\nspend your time doing it. If you spend your time, worth $20—25 per hour, doing something that someone\nelse will do for $10 per hour, it’s simply a poor use of resources. It is important to take baby steps\ntoward paying others to do work for you. Few do it, which is another reason so few people have their\nideal lifestyles.\n\nEven if the cost is occasionally more per hour than you currently earn, the trade is often worth it. Let’s\nassume you make $50,000 and thus $25 per hour (working from 9-5, Monday through Friday, for 50\nweeks per year). If you pay a top-notch assistant $30 per hour and he or she saves you one full 8-hour\nshift per week, your cost (subtracting what you’re being paid) is $40 to free an extra day. Would you pay\n$40 per week to work Monday to Thursday? I would, and I do. Keep in mind that this is a worst-case\ncost scenario.\n\nBut what if your boss freaks out?\n\nIt’s largely a non-issue, and prevention is better than cure. There is no ethical or legal reason for the\nboss to know if you choose non-sensitive tasks. The first option is to assign personal items. Time is time,\nand if you’re spending time on chores and errands that could be spent better elsewhere, a VA will\nimprove life and the management learning curve is similar. Second, you can delegate business tasks that\ndon’t include financial information or identify your company.\n\nReady to build an army of assistants? Let’s first look at the dark side of delegation. A review is in\norder to prevent abuses of power and wasteful behavior.\n\nDelegation Dangers: Before Getting Started\n\nThe first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient\noperation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient\noperation will magnify the inefficiency.\n\n— BILL GATES\n\nH... you ever been given illogical assignments, handed unimportant work, or commanded to do\n\nsomething in the most inefficient fashion possible? Not fun and not productive.\n\nNow it’s your turn to show that you know better. Delegation is to be used as a further step in\nreduction, not as an excuse to create more movement and add the unimportant. Remember—unless\nsomething is well-defined and important, no one should do it.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013875\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

See JA3777-78. In particular, plaintiffs alleged that support during that\ncrucial period enabled al-Qaeda to expand its footprint, train terrorists, plot and plan acts of terror, and carry out such acts\naround the world. JA798-800, 823, 843-44, 3783, 3836, 3871; cf SPA152 (Terrorist Attacks IV) (as the district court\nelsewhere acknowledged, “[s]ince its inception in the late 1980’s, al-Qaeda has relied on well-placed financial facilitators and\nlogistical sponsors to raise, manage and distribute money and resources, enabling it to grow rapidly into a formidable\ninternational terrorist network”).\n\nImposing ATA liability on defendants who provide this crucial formative support for a terrorist organization is clearly\nconsistent with Congress’ intent, see supra pp. 66-73, and consistent with the nature of *119 how terrorist groups grow and\nbecome capable of undertaking attacks which, like the September 11 attacks, often take years of planning and development.\nSee, e.g., 9/11 Commission Final Report p. 48. Thus, as the Seventh Circuit has held en banc, the ATA is predicated on the\nassumption that “[t]errorism campaigns often last for many decades .... Seed money for terrorism can sprout acts of violence\nlong after the investment.” Boim IIT, 549 F.3d at 700. The court went so far as to conclude that, as a general matter, imposing\nliability upon “someone who with the requisite state of mind contributed to a terrorist organization in 1995 that killed an\nAmerican abroad in 2045 ... would not be as outlandish, given the character of terrorism, as one might think.” Jd. at 699-700.\nHere, of course, a much more direct connection of a few years exists between defendants’ acts that supported the\ndevelopment of what became the world’s most extensive and capable global terrorist organization and that group’s execution\nof its most sophisticated and deadly operation.\n\nLastly, the district court found that “[t]he United States had not even been targeted by al Qaeda” when “defendants provided\n[Osama bin Laden] with funding” while “in Sudan during the early 1990’s.” SPA247 (Terrorist Attacks V). This finding is\nblatantly incorrect. See supra pp. 28- *120 29. Osama bin Laden had been openly “singl[ing] out the United States for attack”\n“since 1992.” 9-11 Commission Final Report, at 48. “Plans to attack the United States were developed with unwavering\nsingle-mindedness throughout the 1990s.” Jd.\n\nII. The District Court Improperly Dismissed The Alien Tort Statute Claims Because The Statute Encompasses Claims\nBased On Acts Related To International Terrorism\n\nThe district court dismissed the Alien Tort Statute (“ATS”) claims against a handful of defendants because it thought\nplaintiffs were required to, but did not, plead “factual allegations [to] support a reasonable inference that the defendant(s]\npurposefully aided and abetted, conspired with, or materially supported al Qaeda in the commission of an act of terrorism\ninvolving the hyacking of a commercial airplane.” SPA233 (Terrorist Attacks V). That holding is based on a mistaken\nassumption that the ATS authorizes, or plaintiffs alleged, only tort claims based on the hijacking of a commercial airplane in\nviolation of international law. Neither the ATS nor plaintiffs’ complaints are so limited. Instead, the ATS permits the federal\ncourts to adjudicate a civil action “by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the laws of nations or a treaty of the\nUnited States.” 28 U.S.C. § 1350. As explained below, the “laws of nations” *121 prohibit acts of international terrorism,\nincluding the provision of material support for terrorism, and is not so narrowly focused on hijacking commercial airplanes.\nSee infra at Points II.B & C. And, plaintiffs adequately pled facts that readily support a reasonable inference that defendants\nknowingly and intentionally provided financing and other forms of material support to al-Qaeda to further its international\nterrorism. See supra Points I.B.2 & I.B.3.\n\nThe ATS is a jurisdictional statute that Congress enacted as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789 on the “understanding that the\ncommon law would provide a cause of action for the modest number of international law violations with a potential for\npersonal liability at that time,” namely “violation of safe conducts, infringement of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy.”\nSosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 712, 724 (2004). In Sosa, the Supreme Court held that federal courts also may permit\naliens to assert tort claims “based on the present-day law of nations” as long as they “rest on a norm of international character\naccepted by the civilized world and defined with a specificity comparable to the features of the 18th-century paradigms.” Jd.\nat 724-25. In making this determination, courts should consider “the potential implications for the foreign relations of the\nUnited *122 States” and should be “wary of impinging on the discretion of the Legislative and Executive Branches in\nmanaging foreign affairs.” Jd. at 727.\n\nIn cases decided after Sosa, this Court has looked to three factors to determine whether a claim adequately alleges a violation\nof customary international law that is cognizable in a tort action under the ATS. To state an ATS claim, the alleged tort must\n\nWESTLAW\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023399\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

MacDonald's attorneys tried to introduce the testimony of six\nwitnesses - - including a police officer - - to whom she had previously admitted that she was in the\nMacDonald house with her friends that night. Since testimony about Stoeckley's prior ad-missions\nwould technically constitute \"hearsay\" - - that is, testimony by one witness about what another\nwitness had said outside the courtroom - - the judge ruled that the jury could hear about\nStoeckley's hearsay admissions only if [corroborating evidence showed] that they [were]\n‘trustworthy.’ \"\n\nThe judge—who was also unaware of the handwritten lab notes—ruled that there was no\n\"physical evidence\" that corroborated Stoeckley's admissions; therefore, her admissions were not\ntrustworthy. Had he been aware of this corroborating evidence, he would have been obligated to\nallow the hearsay admissions into evidence.\n\nThus, the jury never learned that there was hard, scientific evidence of intruders in the house-or\nthat a woman matching MacDonald's description of one of the intruders had actually admitted to\nsix different people that she and her friends, not Jeffrey MacDonald, were the killers.\n\nMoreover, in 2005, the former Deputy Marshall, Jim Britt, who was in charge of escorting\nHelena Stoeckley to the courtroom came forward and told MacDonald’s lawyer the\nfollowing:\n\nJim Britt avers that he personally witnessed Helena Stoeckley state to James\nBlackburn [the prosecutor] that she and others were present in the MacDonald home\non the night of the MacDonald murders and that they had gone there to acquire\ndrugs; Jim Britt further avers that he witnessed and heard James Blackburn, upon\nhearing this, directly threaten Helena Stoeckley, telling her that if she so testified in\ncourt he would indict her for first degree murder. This threat caused her to change\nher testimony, as the next day, when called to the witness stand by the defense,\nStoeckley claimed to have amnesia as to her whereabouts from midnight until 5 a.m.\nthe night of the MacDonald murders -- the precise time-frame during which the\ncrimes occurred. James Blackburn never disclosed to the court or defense counsel\nwhat Helena Stoeckley admitted to him in Jim Britt's presence. On the contrary,\nBlackburn, at a critical juncture in the trial, advised the court that Stoeckley, when he\ninterviewed her, denied having any knowledge of the MacDonald family, the\nMacDonald home, or involvement in the MacDonald murders. Blackburn even went\nso far as to elicit from Stoeckley, through leading questions before the jury,\ntestimony that was contrary to what she had told him during his interview of her the\nday before in the presence of Jim Britt.\n\nFinally new DNA and forensic testing has revealed three specimens that did not match any of the\npeople in the house, as well as unidentified hairs under the fingernails of the victims. This new\nand suppressed evidence corroborates Stoeckley’s original account that she remembers being in\nthe house and participating in the murders. Had the trial judge known about this corroboration,\nhe would surely have allowed Stoeckley’s earlier statements to be heard by the jury.\n\n197\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017284\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Starr \nKirkland & Ellis LLP \n777 South Figueroa Street \nLos Angeles, CA 90017-5800 \nMay 27, 2008 \nJoe D. Whitley \nAlston & Bird LLP \nThe Atlantic Building \n950 F Street, NW \nWashington. DC 20004-1404 \nVIA FACSIMILE CONFIDENTIAL \nHonorable Mark Filip \nOffice of the Deputy Attorney General \nUnited States Department of Justice \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. \nWashington, D.C. 20530 \nDear Judge Filip: \nThis letter briefly supplements our prior submission to you dated May 19, 2008. In that \ncommunication, we urgently requested that your Office conduct an independent review of the \nproposed federal prosecution of our client, Jeffrey Epstein. The dual reasons for our request that \nyou review this matter are (i) the bedrock need for integrity in the enforcement of federal \ncriminal laws, and (ii) the profound questions raised by the unprecedented extension of federal \nlaw by the United States Attorney's Office in Miami (the \"USAO\") to a prominent public figure \nwho has close ties to former President Clinton. \nThe need for review is now all the more exigent. On Monday, May 19, 2008, First \nAssistant Jeffrey Sloman of the USAO responded to an email from Jay Lefkowitz informing U.S. \nAttorney Alex Acosta that we would be seeking your Office's review. Mr. Sloman's letter, \nwhich imposed a deadline of June 2, 2008 to comply with all the terms of the current Non-\nProsecution Agreement (the \"Agreement\"), plus new unilateral modifications, on pain of being \ndeemed in breach of that Agreement, appears to have been deliberately designed to deprive us of \nan adequate opportunity to seek your Office's review in this matter. \nThe USAO's desire to foreclose a complete review is understandable, given that the \nChild Exploitation and Obscenity Section (\"CEOS\") has already determined that our substantive \narguments regarding why a federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein is not warranted were \n\"compelling.\" However, in contradiction to Mr. Sloman's assertion that CEOS had provided an \nindependent, de novo review, CEOS made clear that it did not do so. Indeed, CEOS declined to \nexamine several of the more troubling aspects of the investigation of Mr. Epstein, including the \ndeliberate leak to the New York Times of numerous highly confidential aspects of the \ninvestigation and negotiations between the parties as well as the recent crop of civil lawsuits \nfiled against Mr. Epstein by Mr. Sloman's former law partner. \nThe unnecessary and arbitrarily imposed deadline set by the USAO was done without any \nrespect for the normal functioning and scheduling of state judicial matters. It requires that \nMr. Epstein's counsel persuade the State Attorney of Palm Beach to issue a criminal information \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019221 \nHonorable Mark Filip \nMay 27, 2008 \nPage 2 \nto a charge that the State Attorney has not, despite a two year investigation, determined to be \nappropriate. Mr. Epstein's counsel must also successfully expedite a plea of guilty to this charge \non a date prior to July 8, 2008, which is the date presently set by the state court Judge. \nFurther, the unnecessary deadline is even more problematic because Mr. Epstein's effort \nto reconcile the state charge and sentence with the terms of the Agreement requires an unusual \nand unprecedented threatened application of federal law. Thus, it places Mr. Epstein in the \nhighly unusual position of having to demand that the State acquiesce to a more severe \npunishment than it had already determined was appropriate. \nWe have attempted to resolve these and other issues through the USA() and CEOS, \nincluding raising our concerns about the USAO's inappropriate conduct with respect to this \nmatter. But those avenues have now been shut down. Mr. Sloman's letter purports to prohibit \nany further contact between Mr. Epstein's defense team and U.S. Attorney Acosta, and instead \nrequires us to communicate with the USA() only though Mr. Sloman's subordinates. \nWhile it pains us to say this, this misguided prosecution from the outset gives the \nappearance that it may have been politically motivated. Mr. Epstein is a highly successful, self-\nmade businessman and philanthropist who entered the public arena only by virtue of his close \npersonal association with former President Bill Clinton. There is little doubt in our minds that \nthe USA() never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case if Mr. Epstein were just \nanother \"John.\" \nU.S. Attorney Acosta previously has stated that he is \"sympathetic\" to our federalism-\nrelated concerns, but he has taken the position that his authority is limited by enforcement \npolicies set forth in Washington, D.C. As expressed in our prior communication to you, we \nbelieve that a complete and independent appraisal and resolution of this case most appropriately \nwould be undertaken by your Office—beginning with the rescission of the arbitrary, unfair, and \nunprecedented deadline that Mr. Sloman demands to have imposed in this case. At the very \nleast, we would appreciate a tolling of the arbitrary timeline imposed on our client by the USA() \nin order to allow time for your office to consider our request that you undertake a review of this \ncase. \nThank you for your time and attention. \nRespectfully submitted, \n, Q-1444 \nKenneth W.

The outsider against the insiders. After all,\nthat’s why he was elected.\n\nAt some level he had a point. One reason presidents don’t fire the director of the FBI is\nthat they fear the consequences. It’s the Hoover syndrome: any president can be hostage to\nwhat the FBI knows, and a president who treats the FBI with something less than\ndeference does so at his own peril. But this president had stood up to the feds. One man\nagainst the unaccountable power that the left had long railed against—and that more\nrecently the right had taken as a Holy Grail issue, too. “Everybody should be rooting for\nme,” the president said to friends, more and more plaintively.\n\nHere was another peculiar Trump attribute: an inability to see his actions the way most\nothers saw them. Or to fully appreciate how people expected him to behave. The notion of\nthe presidency as an institutional and political concept, with an emphasis on ritual and\npropriety and semiotic messaging—statesmanship—was quite beyond him.\n\nInside the government, the response to Comey’s firing was a kind of bureaucratic\nrevulsion. Bannon had tried to explain to Trump the essential nature of career government\nofficials, people whose comfort zone was in their association with hegemonic\norganizations and a sense of a higher cause—they were different, very different, from\nthose who sought individual distinction. Whatever else Comey might be, he was first and\nforemost a bureaucrat. Casting him ignominiously out was yet another Trump insult to the\nbureaucracy.\n\nRod Rosenstein, the author of the letter that ostensibly provided the justification for\nfiring Comey, now stood in the line of fire. The fifty-two-year-old Rosenstein, who, in\nrimless glasses, seemed to style himself as a bureaucrat’s bureaucrat, was the longest-\nserving U.S. attorney in the country. He lived within the system, all by the book, his\nhighest goal seeming to be to have people say he did things by the book. He was a straight\nshooter—and he wanted everyone to know it.\n\nAll this was undermined by Trump—trashed, even. The brow-beating and snarling\npresident had hectored the country’s two top law enforcement officials into an ill-\nconsidered or, at the very least, an ill-timed indictment of the director of the FBI.\nRosenstein was already feeling used and abused. And then he was shown to have been\ntricked, too. He was a dupe.\n\nThe president had forced Rosenstein and Sessions to construct a legal rationale, yet\nthen he could not even maintain the bureaucratic pretense of following it. Having enlisted\nRosenstein and Sessions in his plot, Trump now exposed their efforts to present a\nreasonable and aboveboard case as a sham—and, arguably, a plan to obstruct justice. The\npresident made it perfectly clear that he hadn’t fired the director of the FBI because he did\nHillary wrong; he fired Comey because the FBI was too aggressively investigating him\nand his administration.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020049\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We were surprised at the market’s\nunbridled optimism in April*, since the tug-of-war between private sector profits and public sector problems has a long\nway to go. We chose the charts on the front page of our 2011 Outlook carefully; they were designed to show that equity\nmarkets were priced inexpensively, but were likely to stay that way, given too much stimulus in the East, and ineffective\nstimulus in the West **. We expect a modest second half recovery, based primarily on US capital spending increases,\neasy credit conditions everywhere, and a pick-up in industrial production in Japan. But the world’s structural problems\nare weighing on the private sector, and our portfolios are positioned for a single-digit year in credit, equities and hedge\nfunds.\n\n* The Osama Bin Laden episode marked the equity market peak. Some commentators saw this event as a basis for further optimism,\nbut unsurprisingly, the positive glow lasted for only around 2.5 hours the subsequent Monday. According to the Congressional\nResearch Service, over the last decade, the US has spent at least $1.1 trillion in war funding operations, surpassing the\nconstant-dollar cost of the Korean and Vietnam Wars combined. This highlights the disproportionately large pain that small,\nnon-sovereign entities can inflict in the modern era.\n\n** So far, the large growth and employment multipliers from deficit spending estimated by Christina Romer (former Chair of the\nPresident’s Council of Economic Advisers) have not materialized. John Taylor and John Cogan from Stanford have been closer to the\nmark: an initial boost, but then a rapidly fading benefit\n\nSomething different this week. I was on the road seeing clients last week, and was asked “what should be done about\njob growth”. We are investors and not politicians, so my ideas [a] are not relevant. However, it seems to me that anyone\ninvolved in the jobs debate should be required to read the article below, written after the prior deep US recession\n(1990-1991). It’s from George McGovern, one of the most liberal politicians [b] ever to hold office and run for\nPresident. His epiphanies after leaving office and running the Stratford Inn are worth considering as legislators\ncontemplate additional job creation measures, and the broader regulatory environment in which the private sector\noperates.\n\n“A Politician's Dream Is a Businessman's Nightmare”, by George McGovern, June 1992 [c]\n\nWisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late. (Justice Felix\nFrankfurter). It's been 11 years since I left the U.S. Senate, after serving 24 years in high public office. After\nleaving a career in politics, I devoted much of my time to public lectures that took me into every state in the\nunion and much of Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.\n\nIn 1988, I invested most of the earnings from this lecture circuit acquiring the leasehold on Connecticut's\nStratford Inn. Hotels, inns and restaurants have always held a special fascination for me. The Stratford Inn\npromised the realization of a longtime dream to own a combination hotel, restaurant and public conference\nfacility--complete with an experienced manager and staff. In retrospect, I wish I had known more about the\nhazards and difficulties of such a business, especially during a recession of the kind that hit New England just\nas I was acquiring the inn's 43-year leasehold. I also wish that during the years I was in public office, I had\nhad this firsthand experience about the difficulties business people face every day. That knowledge would\nhave made me a better U.S. senator and a more understanding presidential contender.\n\nToday we are much closer to a general acknowledgment that government must encourage business to expand\nand grow. Bill Clinton, Paul Tsongas, Bob Kerrey and others have, I believe, changed the debate of our\nparty [d]. We intuitively know that to create job opportunities we need entrepreneurs who will risk their\ncapital against an expected payoff. Too often, however, public policy does not consider whether we are\nchoking off those opportunities.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031165\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

President-elect Trump highlighted\nhis commitment to infrastructure investment during his\nvictory speech early November 9. “Weare going to fix our\ninner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels,\nairports, schools, hospitals,” he said. “We’re going to\nrebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way,\nsecond to none. And we will put millions of our people to\nwork as we rebuild it.” Trump would fund infrastructure\ninvestment through public-private partnerships and\nprivate investments through tax incentivesrather than\ntax reform, though he has called for early action on that\nissue as well. On October 22, Trump outlined a voter\ncontract for hisfirst 100 days plan that calls for\nenactment of:\n\n» The Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act\n(comprehensive tax reform);\n\n» The End the Offshoring Act, to establish tariffsto\ndiscourage companies from laying off their workers in\norder to relocatein other countries and ship their\nproducts back to the U.S. tax-free;\n\n» TheAmerican Energy & Infrastructure Act, to leverage\npublic-private partnerships and private investments\nthrough tax incentivesto raise $1 trillionin\ninfrastructure investment over 10 years;\n\n» The School Choice And Education Opportunity Act, to\nexpand primary education options and make college\nmore affordable;\n\n» The Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act, to repeal the\nACA and replace it with Health Savings Accounts;\n\n» The Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act, to allow\nAmericansto deduct childcare and elder care;\n\n» The End Illegal Immigration Act, to fund the\nconstruction of a wall on the Mexican border;\n\n» The Restoring Community Safety Act, to reduce crime;\n\n» The Restoring National Security Act, to rebuild the\nmilitary by eliminating the defense sequester and\nexpanding military investment; and\n\n» The Clean up Corruption in Washington Act, to enact\n“new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce\nthe corrupting influence of special interests on our\npolitics.”\n\nAs part of the voter contract announced in October,\nTrump has also pledged to act on his first day in office to\n“cancel every unconstitutional executive action,\nmemorandum and order issued by President Obama.”\nTrump advisor Anthony Scaramucci said in October that\nthe new administration would repeal the rulemaking on\nconflicts of interest in the delivery of investment advice to\nIRA and 401(k) plan investors.\n\nRegulationsthat have been finalized cannot be\nunilaterally vacated by executive order without\nintervening regulatory or legislative action. In order to\nmake changes to final regulations without legislative\naction, agencies are typically required to follow the\nadministrative procedural process which requires a notice\nand comment process prior to modifying regulations. If\nan Administration wishes to repeal or revise a final\nregulation through the administrative process, the agency\nmay be required to demonstrate that its actions are not\n“arbitrary and capricious,” and based on morethana\nchange in political views. It is possible that a new\nAdministration could dispense with the notice and\ncomment process by moving to issue an interim final rule,\nreplacing the previousregulation. In this situation, the\nagency could be called on demonstrate that it acted with\n“good cause” to circumvent the typical notice and\ncomment requirements.\n\nA new Administration could also use its executive power\nto affect the level of legal defense of challengesto\nexisting regulations provided by the Administration or\ntemporarily refuse to exercise its enforcement\nresponsibilities until compelled through legal action or\npublic pressure.\n\nTrump also intends to immediately begin the process of\nfilling the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of\nAntonin Scalia in early 2016 —one that could spark\nfireworkson Capitol Hilland acrossthe country’s highly\ncharged political environment. How Republicans,\nDemocrats, and Trump navigate through the process of\nnominating and confirming a Justice to the Supreme\nCourt is likely to set the tone in the Senate for the next\ntwo years.\n\nTrump also intends to act on trade issueson his first day\n\nin office, including:\n\n» announcing his intention to renegotiate or withdraw\nfrom NAFTA;\n\n» announcing withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific\nPartnership; and\n\nEY °\n\n| Election 2016\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022380\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In a series of exchanges, Syrian\ntroops on the Golan fired on Israeli tractors in the demilitarized zone below, and\nbegan shelling our argicultural settlements in the Galilee, while we responded\nwith tank fire and then air power, scrambling our jets and shooting down six\nSyrian MiG-21s.\n\nThe first indication that we might be headed toward war came as I returned\nto university for the spring term, and trouble began brewing in the south. Ben-\nGurion had by now retired as prime minister. His successor was the undeniably\nthoughtful, if far less charismatic, Levi Eshkol. During Israel’s Independence\nDay parade on May 15, he received word that Egypt had moved thousands of\ntroops into the Sinai, nearer to the border with Israel. Then, with the Soviets\nwarned Nasser of what they said were Israeli plans for a preemptive strike\nagainst Syria, he went further expelling the United Nations force put in place\nafter the 1956 war.

When I reached the base, Uzi Yairi, who was now\nin charge of the unit, organized us into four teams. He put me in command of\none of them. We were told to prepare ourselves to helicopter into the Sinai,\nattack a series of Egyptian air bases and put the runways out of commission. My\nteam’s target was the base at Gebel Libni, not far from where I’d placed, and\nrecently failed to defuse, our first intelligence intercept.\n\nWith each passing day, war looked more likely, and there was no confidence\nwe would win without a costly struggle. In 1948, Arab attacks had killed about\n170 people in Tel Aviv. Now, word got out that a park in the center of the city\nhad been set aside to allow for the burial of as many as 5,000. With Israel’s\nmilitary commanders pressing Eshkol to take the initiative and launch a\npreemptive strike, he delivered a radio address at the end of May, intended to\nreassure the country the situation was under control.

I looked up the statistics, black kids in the US have slower cognitive development (and never catch\nup), which the study of course attributed to social factors without any evidence, and they had faster motor\ndevelopment! I suspect this means their brains are slower at learning high-level concepts, because the low-level\nstructures are optimized for a shorter time. But they will keep the lead in motor development, because it is\neasier to learn, and they have more time and attention to practice once they get the structures in place.\n\nIt could also be that they have an additional set of learning directives in place that adapts them better to a more\nhunting/running style of life, whereas the Europeans had to adapt for identifying long-term seasonal patterns,\ndelayed gratification for agriculture etc.\n\nand CONCEPTS could be layer to layer communicaiton. . are gender differences also a matter of time , and\nstructure of interactions. .\n\nI suspect gender differences are mostly motivational, i.e. we have a reward system for all the different social\nand cognitive needs, which makes us receive different kinds of pleasure and pain, thereby pay attention and\nlearn. You cannot learn what does not attract your attention. Women tend to find abstract systems, conflicts and\nmechanisms intrinsically boring. Most women in computer science do not write programs because they enjoy\nsolving puzzles, but because they want to help people, get approval etc. There are almost no women in math,\nbecause it does not help people or yield social attention.\n\nMen tend to find elaborate social relations boring. If there is no pleasure in observing and empathizing with\npeople, one will not have good social cognition.\n\n1Q is not the only meaningful difference. Chinese pay an inordinate amount of attention to authority. I suspect\nhistorically., the authorities tended to kill them a lot if they did not. Jews tend be intellectually independent and\nanti-authoritarian, which might make them creative and inventive in ways that are hard to find in Asia.\n\nAt the moment, I think speed/quality of brain development plus motivational system are the key to\nunderstanding both mind and individual differences. Important part of human language might be the result in a\nmotivational need to discover/invent grammatical structure, which as a side effect makes us interested in music.\nIt would mean that Chomsky’s life long hypothesis, that people have a special circuit for grammatical language,\nis wrong.

It is a nine-minute walk through the transit passage-\nway. Snowden, though, had one good reason for not going to Ecua-\ndor, even if Russia had permitted it. He believed that he would be\nvulnerable to rendition by the U.S. government in Ecuador. “If they\n[the U.S. government] really wanted to capture me, they would’ve\nallowed me to travel to Latin America, because the CIA can oper-\nate with impunity down there,” he explained in the previously cited\ninterview with Katrina vanden Heuvel, the editor of The Nation, in\n2014. He had already discussed the likelihood of his being captured\nin Ecuador with Assange before his departure for Moscow. He later\ntold Alan Rusbridger, the editor of The Guardian, that he considered\nhimself at risk in Latin America. So why would Snowden, who told\nGreenwald that his “first priority” was his own “physical safety,”\nleave the comparative safety of Russia to put himself in jeopardy in\nEcuador?\n\nHe had not obtained a visa to Ecuador at its consulate in Hong\nKong, as Kucherena confirmed. The Ecuador destination was, as we\nhave seen, a cover story put out by Assange and his associates, and it\n\n© worked with the press. ®\n\nOver a hundred reporters and photographers scrambled aboard\nAeroflot Flight SU150 to Cuba the next morning in response to this\nanonymous tip on a website, but Snowden was not aboard that flight\nand was not seen in Terminal E. By the time the plane landed in\nCuba, Aeroflot denied that anyone named Snowden had ever been\nbooked on any of its flights to Cuba, a denial it continued to repeat to\nevery reporter who queried the airline for the next six weeks.\n\nThe first news that Snowden was still in Russia came on July 1,\n2013. A statement posted on the WikiLeaks website—and signed\n“Edward Snowden”—after thanking “friends new and old” for his\n“continued liberty,” accused President Obama of pressuring “leaders\nof nations from which I have requested protection to deny my asy-\nlum petitions.” It added, “This kind of deception from a world leader\nis not justice, and neither is the extralegal penalty of exile. These are\nthe old, bad tools of political aggression.” In fact, Snowden had not\nsuffered a “penalty of exile,” because his passport was still valid for\nreturning to the United States, but that was not an option for him as\nthe statement made clear.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 255 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019743\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The air was so hot the wind carried no\nheat from my hand. When I imagine hot weather it always brings back\nthis memory. It’s my conscious experience of the world.\n\nHumans experience the world through a vivid lens we call\nconsciousness. It allows us to think about the world as we watch it and\nplan actions. But, it also summons associated memories, something\nscientists call ‘qualia. Most writers describe consciousness as an internal\ndialogue with themselves and see it as a consequence of human language.\nThat's probably because most writers are linguists. Non-linguists, perhaps\neven dyslexic engineers like me, experience consciousness as more of a\nvisual dialogue.\n\nIt’s hard to pin down consciousness as the difference between\nhumans and computers. Computers do have something that resembles\nconsciousness; they have watchdog functions, they plan and anticipate\nactions and are aware of their own existence. But they don’t understand\nor make free choices based on this consciousness. It is an entirely\nmechanistic affair. A computer might know its CPU is overheating and\nsend a notification message to the administrator, but it does not really\nappreciate what this means. It does not have our sensation of a near death\nexperience. This self-awareness is the ‘hard question of consciousness.\nWhy, despite the computer knowing it is overheating, does this not\ntranslate into the intense experience we have? Philosophers, such as\nDaniel Dennett, think this lack of consciousness is only a matter of time;\nonce computers live long enough and have sufficient internal complexity\nthey will begin to experience the world the way we do. We are nothing\nspecial.\n\nThe problem with consciousness is it does not seem to have any\nexternally discernible effect. Anesthetics can take it away and brain\nscanners can see that it has been switched off, but what is it for? I think it\ncomes hand in hand with our faculty of creativity. Consciousness allows\nus to shape the world — not the other way round.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015736\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I freed myself and reached for a knife to protect myself.’” A\nsworn statement by the mother reportedly said that her husband “flew off the handle” when\nDesiree told him “she had lost her virginity.”\n\nIn order to avoid his fury once again, this time for having consensual sex with Tyson, she\napparently decided to cry rape once again. At first, she said that he had \"tried\" to rape her. She\ninitially denied having sex with Tyson. Then she said they had sex \"on the floor.\" She told the\nfemale chaplain at the hospital that there had been some \"participation\" and consensual physical\ninvolvement on her part, before he forced her. Finally, she settled on the account she gave at\ntrial: that he had raped her on the bed with no prior consensual involvement on her part.\n\nNo one except Tyson and Washington knows exactly what went on behind the closed doors of his\nhotel room. There was no videotape. Nor was there any physical evidence to corroborate\nWashington’s unlikely story. Indeed, the available physical evidence completely undercuts her\nstory. She was wearing a sequin-studded outfit, which she claims Tyson “yanked” off her as he\n“slammed [her] down on the bed.” If that had happened, there would have been sequins all over\nthe hotel room. Indeed, at the trial, when the dress was gingerly introduced into evidence,\nsequins fell off in the courtroom. But only one sequin was found in Tyson’s hotel room after the\nallegedly forcible rape.\n\nNor were there any bruises—external or internal—found on Ms. Washington that were consistent\nwith her account of how Tyson had “forced” her to have sex. She testified that Tyson “slammed\n[her] down on the bed,” got on top of her, held her down with his forearm across the chest, and\nforced himself inside her.\n\nHad the 230-pound, muscular Tyson done that to the 105-pound, slight Washington, there would\nhave been bruises, welts, contusions, and even broken ribs. Yet there was not even the slightest\nbruise on Washington’s body when she went to the hospital just hours after the sexual encounter.\nThe doctors found only two tiny microscopic abrasions, which, according to leading experts, are\nperfectly consistent with consensual sex—especially if the man has a larger-than-average penis or\nthe woman a smaller-than-average vagina. Such tiny abrasions are also more likely when two\npeople have consensual sex with each other for the first time and are not used to one another’s\nsexual movements and desires. Mike Tyson’s account of what occurred, on the other hand, was\nentirely consistent with the physical evidence. And it would have been corroborated had the\njudge not excluded the three objective eye witnesses who saw them necking and kissing just\nmoments before they went to his hotel room.\n\nDespite the absence of physical evidence to corroborate Desiree Washington's story, the jury\neventually believed her because there was no compelling reason to disbelieve the testimony of a\n\nyoung, religious, sexually inexperienced \"girl\" who had no possible motive to put herself through\nthe agony of a rape trial. But it turns out that there were very good reasons for not believing her.\n\n240\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017327\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

EDWARDS and\nPAUL G. CASSELL,\nvs.\nPlaintiffs/Counterclaim Defendants,\nALAN M. DERSHOWITZ,\nDefendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff.\n___________________________________________/\nIN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE\nSEVENTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT\nIN AND FOR BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA\nCASE NO.: CACE 15-000072\nDEFENDANT/COUNTERCLAIM PLAINTIFF ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ’S REDACTED\nMOTION TO MODIFY CONFIDENTIALITY ORDER\nDefendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff, Alan M. Dershowitz (“Dershowitz”), by and through\nundersigned counsel, hereby files his Redacted Motion to Modify Confidentiality Order of\nJanuary 12, 2016, and in support thereof states the following:\nOn January 16, 2016, Defendant Alan M. Dershowitz began the deposition of non-party\nVirginia Roberts Giuffre (“Roberts”). Pursuant to this Court’s January 12, 2016 Confidentiality\nOrder, that transcript currently is under seal. The Confidentiality Order should be modified at\nleast to allow Dershowitz to defend this case. Dershowitz and his counsel need to be able to\ncontact witnesses, inform them of Roberts’s testimony, and ask them whether Ms. Roberts’s\ntestimony is accurate. They also need to be able to use Ms. Roberts’s testimony in other ways as\npart of the defense effort, such as by providing it to expert witnesses, among other things. The\nbottom line is that Dershowitz’s counsel must be able to use Roberts’s testimony as necessary in\ntheir professional judgment to represent their client, as a matter of fairness and due process.\nAccordingly, Dershowitz requests that the Court modify the Confidentiality Order to\nconfirm that Dershowitz’s counsel may disclose Ms. Roberts’s testimony as they deem necessary\nin their professional judgment in order to represent Dershowitz in this case.\nBACKGROUND & EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nDershowitz was first presented with Roberts’s heinous and false allegations against him\nwhen her lawyers, Bradley J. Edwards (“Edwards”) and Paul G. Cassell (“Cassell”), filed certain\nnow-stricken allegations in the action styled Jane Doe, et al. v. United States of America, No. 08-\n80736 (S.D. Fla.) (the “Federal Action”). After Dershowitz defended himself to the media,\nEdwards and Cassell sued Dershowitz for defamation. The falsity of Roberts’s allegations, her\ncredibility, and the investigation her lawyers took to assess those allegations and credibility\nbefore filing those allegations are a critical part of Dershowitz’s defense.\nOn April 9, 2015, Roberts moved for an order “quashing the subpoena duces tecum\nserved on her by Defendant, or alternatively, pursuant to Florida Rules of Civil Procedure\n1.280(c) for issuance of a protective order sharply limiting the scope of the subpoena” (the\n“Motion to Quash”). See Motion to Quash, attached hereto as Exhibit A. Roberts did not move\nto seal the deposition transcript and the resulting order did not seal it, but instead directed that “a\nconfidentiality order shall be entered.” See November 4, 2015 Email from Judicial Assistant\nSusan Moss, attached hereto as Exhibit B and November 12, 2015 Order, attached hereto as\nExhibit C. The Confidentiality Order then prepared by Roberts’s counsel and consented to by all\nparties includes a provision stating that “[t]he deposition testimony of Non-Party Virginia\nGiuffre will be designated as ‘Confidential’ and not subject to public disclosure” and that “[i]t\nmay only be filed under seal.” See January 12, 2016 Confidentiality Order, attached hereto as\nExhibit D.\n2\nDershowitz now requests that the Court modify the Confidentiality Order to allow\nDershowitz to use the transcript for those limited purposes as deemed necessary in the\nprofessional judgment of his counsel to ensure Dershowitz is afforded his right to build and\npresent his defense.\nI. DERSHOWITZ MUST BE ALLOWED TO CONTACT WITNESSES AND\nADVISE THEM OF WHAT ROBERTS ALLEGES IN ORDER TO VERIFY OR\nDISPROVE HER ALLEGATIONS AND CREDIBILITY AND DETERMINE\nWHETHER PLAINTIFFS EVER MADE EFFORT TO CONTACT THESE\nINDIVIDUALS TO VERIFY ROBERTS’S ALLEGATIONS AND CREDIBILITY.\nAs explained by Plaintiffs Edwards and Cassell in their Response to Dershowitz’s Motion\nto Determine Confidentiality, the “sexual abuse allegations filed by Edwards and Cassell for\ntheir client Ms. Virginia Giuffre are not peripheral to this lawsuit – they are inherent to it.”\nPlaintiffs’ Response to Dershowitz’s Motion to Determine Confidentiality, November 23, 2015,\nattached hereto as Exhibit E at 4 (emphasis added). Those “sexual abuse allegations filed by\nEdwards and Cassell for their client” go beyond Dershowitz. Another inherent part of this\nlawsuit is what investigation, if any, Plaintiffs undertook with respect to the scope of Roberts’s\nallegations, all of which bear upon her credibility. Dershowitz argues that Plaintiffs did not\nperform a reasonable investigation before making the allegations in the Federal Action.\nPlaintiffs argue that they did. Dershowitz must be allowed to contact witnesses and advise them\nof what Roberts alleges so that Dershowitz can not only verify or disprove her allegations and\ncredibility, but also determine whether Plaintiffs ever made efforts to contact key witnesses to\nverify Roberts’s allegations and credibility. As explained by one Florida court, “[o]penness in\ncourts has a salutary effect on the propensity of witnesses to tell the truth” as it “informs persons\naffected by litigation of its effect upon them . . . .” John Doe-1 Through John Doe-4 v. Museum\nof Sci. & History of Jacksonville, Inc., No. 92-32567-CI-CI, 1994 WL 741009, at *1 (Fla. Cir.\nCt. June 8, 1994) (internal citations omitted).\n3\nAs set forth in Dershowitz’s Motion for Clarification of Confidentiality Order or Relief\nfrom that Order, filed Jan. 29, 2016, it appears that Roberts made false statements in a publicly\nfiled affidavit about being present at a private island in the US Virgin Islands when former\nPresident Clinton was there. Indeed, former FBI Director Louis Freeh determined based on the\nresponse of the federal government to a FOIA request that the absence of records responsive to\nthe request “strongly establishes that former President Clinton was not present on Little St.\nJames Island during the period at issue.” Id. at 2. If Roberts made a false statement under oath\nabout former President Clinton, it is equally if not more likely that she has made false statements\nabout others whose whereabouts are more difficult to track.\nRoberts cannot reasonably argue her testimony is confidential as she has already\ndisclosed this same information to the media and others. See Excerpts of Roberts’s Deposition\nTranscript, attached hereto (under seal) as Exhibit F. 1\nRoberts admitted that she sold her story in\n2011, providing the media with the names of her many alleged abusers and providing details so\nlurid that even the tabloid refused to repeat all of them. See id.; see also March 2, 2011, Sharon\nChurcher, Daily Mail, attached hereto as Exhibit G. Dershowitz has also discovered that Roberts\nrepeated her allegations about her alleged abusers to many of her friends and family. See Exhibit\nF; see also AD-006931-006933, Transcript of Telephone Conversation Between Alan M.\nDershowitz and Rebecca, attached hereto as Exhibit H. As a result, Roberts cannot claim that\nthese allegations are confidential simply because she repeated them during her deposition.\n1 As per the Confidentiality Order, Exhibit F is only filed under seal.\n4\nII.\nDERSHOWITZ MUST BE ALLOWED TO SHARE ROBERTS’S DEPOSITION\nTRANSCRIPT WITH THOSE WORKING ON DERSHOWITZ’S BEHALF AS\nPART OF THIS LITIGATION.\nDershowitz asks the Court to modify the Confidentiality Order to allow Dershowitz to\nuse the transcript in ways necessary for his defense including sharing the transcript with any\ncounsel and other legal support, experts, consultants, insurers, and others typically permitted\naccess to supposedly confidential information in addition to using it with potential witnesses and\nothers as deemed necessary in the professional judgment of his counsel as set forth above.\nDershowitz and his attorneys are aware of and will abide by the Florida Rules of Professional\nConduct, including its comments, regarding the handling of any information deemed by this\nCourt to be confidential within the limitations of the applicable rules.\nIII.\nALLOWING DERSHOWITZ TO USE THE DEPOSITION FOR THE LIMITED\nPURPOSES OF HIS DEFENSE IS REQUIRED BY FLORIDA LAW.\nFlorida law requires that any sealing order be the least restrictive means necessary to\naccomplish its purpose. The Florida Supreme Court held in Barron v. Florida Freedom\nNewspapers, 531 So. 2d 113 (Fla. 1988), that a sealing order can be entered only where “no\nreasonable alternative is available to accomplish the desired result, and, if none exists, the trial\ncourt must use the least restrictive closure necessary to accomplish its purpose.” Id. at 118\n(emphasis added); see also Carter v. Conde Nast Publ’ns, 983 So. 2d 23, 26 (Fla. 5th DCA\n2008) (“an order sealing court records must state, inter alia, the particular grounds for making the\ncourt records confidential, that the closure is no broader than necessary, and that there are no less\nrestrictive measures available.”).\nThis Court has not set forth any reasons addressing a request by Roberts to seal her\ndeposition transcript, much less determined that “no reasonable alternative is available” to\naccomplish Roberts’s desired result. See News-Press Publ’g Co. v. State, 345 So. 2d 865, 867\n5\n(Fla. 2d DCA 1977) (“The judge’s statement that he had ‘cogent reasons’ for sealing the records\nobviously fell short of specifically setting forth the reasons why public access to these deposition\nwas being denied.”). Moreover, Roberts and Plaintiffs cannot argue that sealing her deposition\nin its entirety is “the least restrictive” option, as it is most certainly the most restrictive option\nand one that Florida courts take very seriously. “[A] closure order must be drawn with\nparticularity and narrowly applied.” Barron, 531 So. 2d at 117.\nHere, that requisite “least restrictive” application requires, at a minimum, allowing\nDershowitz to use Roberts’s testimony for the limited purposes necessary in the professional\njudgment of his counsel to represent their client, as a matter of fairness and due process.\nCONCLUSION\nBecause Dershowitz must be able to prepare his defense and any sealing order must be\nthe least restrictive measure available, the Court should modify the Confidentiality Order to\nconfirm that Dershowitz’s counsel may disclose Roberts’s testimony as they deem necessary in\ntheir professional judgment in order to represent Dershowitz in this case.\n6\nRespectfully submitted,\nDated: February 3, 2016\ns/Thomas E.

The Defendant is abusing the subpoena power in an effort to\nintimidate, harass and cause undue burden to a non-party. Indeed, Defendant - just days ago -\npublicly admitted that his goal of deposing Jane Doe No. 3 has nothing to do with this Florida\nDefamation Action; rather, he is trying to find a way to send this victim of sexual trafficking to\n“jail.” “She was hiding in Colorado…but we found her and she will have to be deposed. The end\n1 For the limited purpose of the Motion to Quash or for Protective Order and resolving the scope of the\nsubpoena and any enforcement issues, Jane Doe No. 3 voluntarily submits herself to this Court’s\njurisdiction.\nresult is that she’ll go to jail because she will repeat her lies and we’ll be able to prove it and she\nwill end up in prison for perjury.” (emphasis added). See Exhibit 1, New York Daily News, April\n7, 2015. Defendant has subjected Jane Doe No. 3 to horrific public attacks including publicly\ncalling her a “prostitute” and a “bad mother” to her three minor children. See Exhibit 2, Local 10\nNews, January 22, 2015.\nDefendant has gone on a media blitz campaign against this non-party for statements she\nmade under oath in a federal action: “The end result of this case should be she [Jane Doe No. 3]\nshould go to jail, the lawyers should be disbarred and everybody should understand that I am\ncompletely and totally innocent.” (emphasis added). See Exhibit 3, CNN International, New Day,\nJanuary 6, 2015. “My goal is to bring charges against the client and require her to speak in\ncourt.” (emphasis added). See Exhibit 4, Australian Broadcasting System (ABC), January 6,\n2015. Defendant also stated, in an interview in Newsmax, that he is “considering” bringing a\nlawsuit against Jane Doe No. 3. “And we’re considering suing her for defamation as well, but\nright now she was trying to hide in Colorado and avoid service, but we found her and we served\nher and now she’ll be subjected to a deposition.” (emphasis added). See Exhibit 5, Newsmax,\nApril 8, 2015.\nDefendant’s own words demonstrate that he is abusing the subpoena power of this Court to\ntry to get discovery that is irrelevant to this case, in the hopes of being able to intimidate Jane Doe\nNo. 3 with the press and generate a claim against her. Considering the extensive abuse that Jane\nDoe No. 3 suffered as a minor child, and Defendant’s threats and intimidation, it would be both\nunreasonable and oppressive to require this non-party to comply with this subpoena duces tecum.\nAccordingly, Defendant’s subpoena should be quashed. See Exhibit 6, Defendant’s Subpoena to\nJane Doe No. 3.\n2\nBACKGROUND\nThe underlying action before this Court is a defamation case filed by a former federal\njudge, Paul Cassell, and his colleague Brad Edwards, who represent various sexual trafficking\nvictims in a case pending in the Southern District of Florida, specifically case no. 08-cv-80736-\nKAM, hereinafter (“CVRA case”). As a result of an affidavit filed in the CVRA case, Defendant\nwent on a national media defamation campaign calling, among other things, former federal judge\nPaul Cassell and attorney Brad Edwards, “unethical lawyers” who should be “disbarred”. See\nExhibit 7, Today Show, January 5, 2015. In response to this national slander campaign by the\nDefendant, Paul Cassell and Brad Edwards filed a defamation case against Defendant in the\nCircuit Court of the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit for Broward County, Case No. CACE 15-\n000072, hereinafter “Florida Defamation Action”).\nDefendant’s statements against Paul Cassell and Brad Edwards are statements about their\ncharacter as lawyers and do not directly involve non-party Jane Doe No. 3. Despite this fact,\nDefendant is abusing the subpoena power in this case by seeking documents from a non-party that\nare irrelevant to the defamation issue before this Court. Defendant is determined to find a way to\nharm non-party Jane Doe No. 3 and anyone who braves to represent her. Jane Doe No. 3 has good\ncause to be fearful of the Defendant in this matter based on Defendant’s repetitive threats. See\nExhibit 8, Affidavit of Jane Doe No. 3. This Court should not allow Defendant to abuse the\nsubpoena power to further abuse this non-party. Florida Rules of Civil Procedure provide a\nvehicle for this Court to protect a non-party from a harassing, burdensome and unnecessary\nsubpoena. As explained below, non-party Jane Doe No. 3 should be protected from having to be\ndeposed in this matter or produce documents. Defendant’s campaign of threats and intimidation\nshould not be condoned by this Court and Defendant’s subpoena should be quashed in its entirety.\n3\nARGUMENT\n1. This Court Should Quash Defendant’s Abusive Subpoena In Its Entirety.\nFlorida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.410(c)(1) provides that the Court may “quash or modify\nthe subpoena if it is unreasonable and oppressive.” Id. The Court has discretion to evaluate the\ncircumstances in determining whether the subpoena is “unreasonable and oppressive.” Matthews\nv. Kant, 427 So. 2d 369, 370 (Fla. 2d DCA 1983). “The sufficiency thereof is a factual\ndetermination for the trial judge who is vested with broad judicial discretion in the matter, and\nwhose order will not be overturned absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion.” Id.; see also\nSunrise Shopping Center, Inc. v. Allied Stores Corp., 270 So. 2d 32 (Fla. 4th DCA 1972) (Fourth\nDCA quashing lengthy subpoena served on non-party who was not in control of documents as\nbeing “oppressive and unreasonable.”). It is undisputed that Jane Doe No. 3 was sexually\ntrafficked as a minor child by Jeffrey Epstein and he was sentenced for his crimes. Allowing the\nDefendant in this case to force this non-party to provide discovery on this highly sensitive topic\nwould be both oppressive and unreasonable and serves no purpose other than to foster Defendant’s\npublicly admitted and utterly baseless campaign to try to send Jane Doe No. 3 to “jail.”\nThe documents requested in Defendant’s subpoena demonstrate the oppressive and\nunreasonable nature of the requests. Defendant, for example, seeks highly personal and sensitive\ninformation from this victim of sexual trafficking, including requesting her personal diary during\nthe time when she was being sexually abused as a minor child. See Exhibit 6, Request no. 16.\nDefendant also demands that this non-party produce photographs and videos of her as a minor\nchild while she was being sexually trafficked by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. See\nExhibit 6, Request nos. 2, 3, 4 and 10. Defendant’s unreasonable subpoena even includes a\ndemand for this non-party’s personal cell phone records for more than a three (3) year period\nduring the time when she was a minor child being sexually trafficked. See Exhibit 6, Request no.\n4\n15. Defendant also demands items like personal financial documents from this non-party\nincluding payments she received from convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the men he\n“lent” this minor child out to from 1999 – 2002. See Exhibit 6, Request no. 20. It is without\nquestion that Defendant is abusing the subpoena power in this case to conduct a fishing expedition\nin an effort to intimidate and harass this victim and to try to dig up information he can use in his\nopenly stated “goal” to send this non-party to “jail.”\nJane Doe No. 3 is rightfully fearful of Defendant as he is an incredibly powerful individual\nand the legal counselor to convicted Jeffrey Epstein who sexually trafficked Jane Doe No. 3 for\nyears when she was a minor child. See Exhibit 8, Affidavit of Jane Doe No. 3. Jane Doe No. 3\nbelieves Defendant’s goal is to abuse the subpoena power to get her into a deposition so he can\nharass and intimidate her by forcing her to discuss the abuse she had to withstand as a minor child.\nSee Exhibit 8, Affidavit of Jane Doe No. 3. None of that childhood abuse is relevant to this case\nwhich involves the narrow issue of whether Defendant defamed two lawyers. Defendant’s\nsubpoena is both unreasonable and oppressive and should be quashed. See Matthews v. Kant, 427\nSo. 2d 369, 370 (Fla. 2d DCA 1983).\n2. The Court Should Quash The Subpoena In Its Entirety, But At A Minimum, It\nShould Severely Limit The Production Requirements.\nIn addition to its power to quash the subpoena, Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.280(c)\nalso allows the Court to protect a non-party from discovery that would result in “annoyance,\nembarrassment, oppression or undue burden or expense…” Allstate Ins. Co. v. Langston, 655 So.\n2d 91, 94 (Fla. 2003) (Florida Supreme Court overturning denial of protective order and holding\nthat “[d]iscovery of certain kinds of information ‘may reasonably cause material injury of an\nirreparable nature.’”) (internal quotations omitted). Matthews v. City of Maitland, 923 So. 2d 591,\n595 (Fla. 5th DCA 2006) (quashing discovery order where “[t]he compelled disclosure… would\ncreate a chilling effect on [petitioners] rights…”). The Court may determine that “the discovery\n5\nnot be had” or that “the discovery may be had only on specified terms and conditions…”. Fla. R.\nCiv. P. 1.280(c).\nDefendant issued a vastly overbroad subpoena to this non-party which included 25\nseparate document requests, many with subparts. In addition to placing an undue burden on this\nnon-party to have to search for the broad scope of materials requested, the document requests seek\ninformation that is irrelevant to the Florida Defamation Action and clearly intended to “embarrass\nand oppress” this non-party. Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.280(c). Defendant’s overly broad subpoena to nonparty,\nJane Doe No. 3, goes so far as to seek documents relating to former President, Bill Clinton\nand former Vice President, Al Gore, which, even if such documents existed, would be absolutely\nirrelevant to the Florida Defamation Action. See Toledo v. Publix Super Markets, Inc., 30 So. 3d\n712 (Fla. 4 th DCA 2010).\nDefendant’s requests can be grouped into four key categories: (1) documents that contain\nhighly personal and sensitive information sought only to harass, embarrass and intimidate the nonparty;\n(2) documents unrelated to this action and, instead, intended to gain discovery relating to\nDefendant’s admitted “goal” of putting this non-party in “jail,” bringing a new case against Jane\nDoe No. 3, or related to the federal action; (3) documents that contain personal financial or other\nconfidential information; and (4) privileged communications between the non-party and her\nlawyers. Non-party, Jane Doe No. 3, has filed specific objections as to each request sought in\nDefendant’s subpoena as set forth in Exhibit 9. Here, Jane Doe No. 3 provides the Court with a\nsampling of the oppressive nature of the subpoena that is the subject of her detailed objections.\na. Category 1 – Overly Broad Subpoena Requests Intended Solely to Harass, Embarrass\nand Intimidate the Non-Party by Seeking Highly Personal and Sensitive Information\nIt is clear from the Defendant’s requests that his intent is to intimidate and harass this nonparty\nby seeking highly sensitive personal information that is irrelevant to this action. For\nexample, Request no. 16 seeks “Any diary, journal or calendar concerning your activities between\n6\nJanuary 1, 1999 and December 31, 2002.” Defendant is seeking personal diary information during\nthe time this non-party was a minor child and a victim of sexual trafficking. There is no reason\nthis non-party should be forced to produce her diary from when she was a child. See Peisach v.\nAntuna, 539 So. 2d 544 (Fla. 3rd DCA 1989) (court of appeal holding that trial court departed\nfrom the essential requirements of law by granting deposition of party’s gynecologist which was\nonly meant to invade privacy and intimidate and harass the party).\nDefendant also has a number of requests (Request nos. 2, 3, 4, 10 and 19) that seek\n“photographs” and “videos” of this non-party when she was a minor child and during the time she\nwas the subject of sexual abuse. Photographs of Jane Doe 3 when she was a minor child are\ncompletely irrelevant to the matter before this Court. Defendant served this subpoena demand\nsolely to intimidate, harass and embarrass this non-party and the Court should preclude this type\nof discovery set forth in Request Nos. 2, 3, 4, 10, 15, 16, 19 and 21. See Citimortgage, Inc. v.\nDavis, No. 50 2009 CA 030523, 2011 WL 3360318 (Fla. 15 th Cir. Ct. April 4, 2011) (trial court\ngranting protective order precluding a deposition noting “this deposition request is mere\nharassment” and had no relevance to the underlying dispute where the party was wrongfully using\nthe discovery process for personal gain).\nb. Category 2 – Clear Abuse of the Subpoena Power By Seeking Documents Unrelated\nto this Action and Intended Instead to Provide Discovery for Other Actions\nDefendant is abusing the subpoena power of this Court by issuing subpoena requests that\nare intended to obtain discovery for the development of other actions against this non-party and\nare unrelated to the instant case. See Exhibit 5, Newsmax Interview (“And we’re considering\nsuing her for defamation as well, but right now she was trying to hide in Colorado and avoid\nservice, but we found her and we served her and now she’ll be subjected to a deposition.”).\nDefendant has admitted that his “goal” is to put Jane Doe No. 3 in “jail” and he is using this\nCourt’s subpoena power to go on a fishing expedition in the hopes of fulfilling his ultimate stated\n7\n“goal.” See Toledo v. Publix Super Markets, Inc., 30 So. 3d 712 (Fla. 4 th DCA 2010) (court of\nappeal quashing discovery order where party sought law firm client file relating to a different\nmatter holding that “curiosity” about a law firm’s records does not satisfy the relevance\nrequirement and explaining that the contents of the “subpoena is a classic ‘fishing expedition’ and\nthe trial court’s order departs from the essential requirements of the law.”); Calvo v. Calvo, 489\nSo. 2d 833, 834 (Fla. 3d DCA 1986) (quashing subpoena served on wife’s bank for financial\nrecords finding them irrelevant: “indeed, the husband has failed to demonstrate what possible\nrelevance the records might have in the proceeding below other than to harass the wife.”).\n(emphasis added).\nDefendant’s incredibly broad and unrelated demands include, for example, Request no. 24:\n“All documents concerning, relating or referring to your assertions that you met former President\nBill Clinton, Former Vice President Al Gore and/or Mary Elizabeth “Tipper” Gore on Little Saint\nJames Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.” See Exhibit 6, Request no. 24. Whether or not Jane Doe\nNo. 3 met any of these individuals has absolutely nothing to do with the action before this Court.\nSee Allstate Ins. Co. v. Langston, 655 So. 2d 91, 94 (Fla. 2003) (Florida Supreme Court holding\nthat “we do not believe a litigant is entitled carte blanch to irrelevant discovery” and ‘“It is\naxiomatic that information sought in discovery must relate to the issues involved in the litigation,\nas framed in the pleadings.’”) (internal citations omitted). Defendant’s Request demonstrates a\nblatant example of abuse of the subpoena power.\nIndeed, the face of many of Defendant’s subpoena demands demonstrate that he is using\nthe subpoena power of this Court to obtain discovery for the federal action. Request nos. 1, 5, 6\nand 9 all reference the “federal action” or specifically cite the declaration and case number “OS-\nSO736-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON. Request no. 1, for example, demands: “All documents that\nreference by name, Alan M. Dershowitz, which support and/or confirm the allegations set forth in\nParagraphs 24-31 of your Declaration dated January 19, 2015 and/or Paragraph 49 of your\n8\nDeclaration dated February 5, 2015, which were filed with the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida, in Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 v. United States of America, Case\nNo. OS-S0736-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON, [ECF No. 291-1] (the \"Federal Action\").” Defendant\nshould not be using the subpoena power of this Court to issue a non-party subpoena for documents\nsought for a federal action. 2\nc. Category 3 – Documents that Contain Personal Financial Information Completely\nIrrelevant to this Action\nDefendant also wrongfully abuses the subpoena power to seek personal financial\ninformation from this non-party. See Woodward v. Berkery, 714 So. 2d 1027, 1034-38 (Fla. 4 th\nDCA 1998) (quashing lower court’s discovery order and finding irreparable harm to husband in\ndisclosure of private financial information when wife’s clear purpose was to wrongfully disclose\nthe financial information to the press) (emphasis added); see also Granville v. Granville, 445 So.\n2d 362 (Fla. 1 st DCA 1984) (court of appeal overturning denial of protective order and finding that\nprivate financial information should have been protected from disclosure).\nThe requests are clearly meant to intimidate and harass her by, for example, seeking\ninformation during the time she was the subject of sexual trafficking by Jeffrey Epstein. Request\nno. 20 seeks “All documents showing any payments or remuneration of any kind made by Jeffery\nEpstein or any of his agents or associates to you from January 1, 1999 through December 31,\n2002.” Whether Jeffrey Epstein paid minor children that he sexually trafficked has absolutely\nnothing to do with the action before this Court and there is no basis to force a non-party who was\nsubject to this abuse to comply with a production demand on this topic. The subpoena also\nincludes request for financial information relating to the media. Apparently, Defendant believes\nJane Doe No. 3 has a book “deal” in the works. For example, Request no. 18 seeks: “All\ndocuments concerning any monetary payments or other consideration received by you from any\n2 The requests relevant to this category are nos.: 1, 5, 6,7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 22, and 24.\n9\nmedia outlet in exchange for your statements (whether \"on the record\" or \"off the record\")\nregarding Jeffrey Epstein, Alan M. Dershowitz, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and/or being a sex\nslave.” Whether Jane Doe No. 3 has interacted with the media has nothing to do with the Florida\nDefamation Action. As explained above, a non-party’s personal financial information and other\nconfidential information is subject to protection by this Court. See Woodward v. Berkery, 714 So.\n2d 1027, 1034-38 (Fla. 4th DCA 1998). Accordingly, the requests relating to financial\ninformation from this non-party should be quashed 3 .\nd. Category 4 – Plainly Privileged Communications\nDefendant’s subpoena requests seek documents that are plainly privileged. Florida courts\nare unequivocal in stating that an opposing party can never obtain attorney-client privileged\nmaterials. See Quarles & Brady LLP v. Birdsall, 802 So. 2d 1205, 1206 (Fla. 2d DCA 2002)\n(quashing discovery order and noting “undue hardship is not an exception (to disclosure of\nprivileged material), nor is disclosure permitted because the opposing party claims that the\nprivileged information is necessary to prove their case.”) (internal citations omitted). Non-party,\nJane Doe No. 3, objects to all of Defendant’s subpoena requests to the extent that they seek\ndocuments protected by the attorney client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense and\ncommon interest privileges and any other relevant privilege. Indeed, Jane Doe No. 3 should be\nprotected from responding to Request no. 25 in its entirety because on its face it seeks solely\nprivileged and confidential information relating to her retention of BSF. 4\nSee Westco Inc. v. Scott\nLewis’ Gardening & Trimming, Inc., 26 So. 3d 620, 622 (Fla. 4 th DCA 2010) (court explaining\nthat “[w]hen confidential information is sought from a non-party, the trial court must determine\nwhether the requesting party establishes a need for the information that outweighs the privacy\n3 These Requests include nos. 9, 17, 18, 20 and 23.\n4 Specifically, Request no. 25 seeks: “All documents concerning your retention of the law firm Boies,\nSchiller & Flexner LLP, including but not limited to: signed letter of retainer, retention agreement,\nexplanation of fees, and/or any documents describing the scope of retention.”\n10\nrights of the non-party.”). Defendant has not established any basis for these privileged and\nconfidential documents that outweighs this non-party’s privacy rights.\n3. The Subpoena Should Be Quashed In Its Entirety. If the Court Will Not Take\nThat Action, at a Minimum, It Should Grant a Protective Order Severely\nLimiting The Areas Of Inquiry At Deposition And Grant Protections For This\nVictim Who Is Fearful Of The Defendant.\nThis Court has the power to preclude and/or limit the deposition of non-party Jane Doe No.\n3. Specifically, Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.280(c) allows the Court to prevent a deposition\nfrom going forward “to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression or\nundue burden or expense that justice requires,” and courts routinely enter protective orders to\nreduce the burden on subpoenaed non-parties to a case, as well as in cases where the discovery\nsough is irrelevant. See, e.g., Peisach v. Antuna, 539 So. 2d 544 (Fla. 3d DCA 1989) (holding that\nthe trial judge erred in allowing the deposition of certain non-parties where evidence sought was\nirrelevant); see also Citimortgage, Inc. v. Davis, No. 50 2009 CA 030523, 2011 WL 3360318 (Fla.\n15 th Cir. Ct. April 4, 2011) (trial court granting protective order precluding a deposition noting\n“this deposition request is mere harassment” and had no relevance to the underlying dispute where\nthe party was wrongfully using the discovery process for personal gain). Section 4 of Rule 1.280\nprovides that the Court can also limit the areas of inquiry of a deposition providing “that certain\nmatters not be inquired into, or that the scope be limited to certain matters.”\nJane Doe No. 3 contends that the subpoena for her deposition should be quashed. If the\nCourt, however, is inclined to allow a deposition of Jane Doe No. 3, then she respectfully requests\nthe issuance of a Protective Order modifying the subpoena as set forth below.\na. Testimony Limitations\nNon-party Jane Doe No. 3 respectfully requests that this Court limit the deposition to\nquestions directly related to Defendant’s defamatory statements about Brad Edwards and Paul\nCassell. The Court should limit Defendant’s ability to engage in a “fishing expedition” of this\n11\nvictim to foster his goal of putting her into “jail” or of bringing a new action against Jane Doe No.\n3. See Peisach v. Antuna, 539 So. 2d 544 (Fla. 3d DCA 1989); see also Citimortgage, Inc. v.\nDavis, No. 50 2009 CA 030523, 2011 WL 3360318 (Fla. 15 th Cir. Ct. Apr. 4, 2011). Defendant\nshould be precluded from asking any questions about Jane Doe No. 3’s experiences as a sexually\ntrafficked minor. Defendant should be precluded from questioning Jane Doe No. 3 about\nindividuals that she was sexually trafficked to or about other victims or individuals involved in the\nsexual trafficking orchestrated by Jeffrey Epstein. Defendant should be precluded from\nquestioning Jane Doe No. 3 about any rapes that occurred when she was a minor child. Defendant\nshould be precluded from questioning Jane Doe No. 3 about anything related to her sexual activity\neither as a minor or thereafter as these questions would only be intended to embarrass and harass\nthis non-party witness.\nb. Language and Harassment Limitations\nIn addition, Jane Doe No. 3 requests that the Court provide counsel with a cautionary\nnotice, that counsel for Defendant may not harass the non-party victim in any way during the\ndeposition. With respect to the language used at the deposition, the Defendant’s counsel should be\ndirected by the Court to not use any of the derogatory terms the Defendant has used in the press\nincluding calling Jane Doe No. 3 a “prostitute,” a “liar,” or a “bad mother” or any other similar\nderogatory and harassing language.\nc. Physical Location Limitations\nNon-party Jane Doe No. 3 has a valid and real basis to fear being in physical proximity of\nthe Defendant. See Exhibit 8, Affidavit of Jane Doe No. 3. Accordingly, to the extent a\ndeposition is to go forward, we would request that the Court direct that the Defendant not be\npresent in the same room as non-party Jane Doe No. 3 and, instead, follow the testimony\nelectronically from a separate location. In addition, non-party Jane Doe No. 3 respectfully\nrequests that the Court hold that the physical location of the deposition should be the offices of\n12\nJane Doe No. 3’s attorney’s Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP.\nCONCLUSION\nWHEREFORE, non-party Jane Doe No. 3 respectfully requests that this Court grant her\nMotion to Quash, or alternatively, that the Court enter an order limiting the scope of her document\nproduction and deposition as set forth above.\nDated: April 9, 2015\nRespectfully submitted,\nBOIES, SCHILLER & FLEXNER LLP\n401 East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite 1200\nFort Lauderdale, Florida 33301\nTelephone: (954) 356-0011\nFacsimile: (954) 356-0022\nBy: /s/Sigrid S.

EDWARDS and PAUL G.\nCASSELL,\nCASE NO.: CACE 15-000072\nPlaintiffs,\nvs.\nALAN M. DERSHOWITZ,\nDefendant.\n/\nPLAINTIFFS/COUNTERCLAIM DEFENDANT EDWARDS AND\nCASSELL'S RESPONSE TO DERSHOWITZ'S MOTION TO DETERMINE\nCONFIDENTIALITY OF COURT RECORDS\nPlaintiffs/Counterclaim Defendants Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G. Cassell, by and\nthrough their undersigned attorneys, hereby file this response to Dershowitz's Motion to\nDetermine Confidentiality of Court Records. The records at issue are not confidential, and so the\nCourt should deny Dershowitz's motion in its entirety.\nThe court records at issue are three court filings by attorneys Edwards and Cassell\nin which they recite their client's (Mr. Virginia Giuffre's) allegations that she was sexually\nabused by Dershowitz. These records are hardly \"confidential\" in this defamation case,\nwhere the parties have claims and counterclaims about these sexual abuse\nAllegations. Rather, these records are an important part of this case, since they not only\nsupport the conclusion that Dershowitz abused Ms. Giuffre, but also indisputably establish\nEdwards and Cassell's strong basis for filing the allegations on her behalf. Moreover,\ncontrary to assertions made in Dershowitz's motion, these documents have never been\nfound to be \"confidential\" by any other court. And Dershowitz has repeatedly referred to\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 2 of 20\nthese documents, not only in defamatory statements broadcast worldwide, but also in his\npleadings before this Court and in recent depositions. Indeed, Dershowitz said in his\nmedia interviews that he wants \"everything to be made public\" and implied that Edwards\nand Cassell had something to hide. Accordingly, Dershowitz has failed to carry his heavy\nburden to justify sealing these presumptively-public documents.\nI. DERSHOWITZ HAS NOT JUSTIFIED SEALING ALLEGED\nDEFAMATORY RECORDS THAT ARE INTEGRAL TO THIS\nDEFAMATION CASE.\nIn his motion, Dershowitz never recounts the heavy burden that he must carry to seal the\nrecords at issue. To be sure, Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 allows for the sealing\nof \"confidential\" materials. But the Rule begins by recounting the overarching principle that\n\"[t]he public shall have access to all records of the judicial branch of government, except as\nprovided below.\" Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.420(a). This rule is a codification of the Florida\nSupreme Court's admonition that a \"a strong presumption of openness exists for all court\nproceedings. A trial is a public event, and the filed records of court proceedings are public\nrecords available for public examination.\" Barron v. Florida Freedom Newspapers, Inc., 531\nSo.2d 113, 118 (Fla. 1988) (emphasis added). In light of this presumption of openness, \"[t]he\nburden of proof in [closure] proceedings shall always be on the party seeking closure.\" Id. To\nobtain a sealing order, the party seeking sealing must carry a \"heavy burden.\" Id.\nRemarkably, Dershowitz fails to acknowledge these well-settled principles. More\nimportant, he even fails to cite (much less discuss) the limited substantive exceptions to this\ngeneral principle of access — and which specific exception he believes applies to this\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 3 of 20\ncase. Accordingly, it is impossible for Edwards and Cassell to respond with precision to his\nmotion.\nThe exceptions that might arguably be in play in this case permit records to be maintained\nas confidential in order to:\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n(v)\n(vi)\nPrevent a serious and imminent threat to the fair, impartial, and orderly\nadministration of justice;\nProtect trade secrets;\nProtect a compelling governmental interest;\nObtain evidence to determine legal issues in a case;\nAvoid substantial injury to innocent third parties;\nAvoid substantial injury to a party by disclosure of matters protected by a\ncommon law or privacy right not generally inherent in the specific type of\nproceeding sought to be closed;\nComply with established public policy set forth in the Florida or United\nStates Constitution or statutes or Florida rules or case law ....\nFla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.420(c)(9) (codifying the holding in Barron v. Florida Freedom\nNewspapers, Inc., 531 So.2d 113 (Fla. 1988)). The only exception that seems to even arguably\napply here is exception vi, which itself specifically provides that confidentiality is appropriate\nonly where disclosure is \"not generally inherent in the specific type of proceeding sought to be\nclosed\" (emphasis added). Of course, this lawsuit is a defamation action — involving\na defamation claim by Edwards and Cassell and a defamation counterclaim by\nDershowitz. Disclosure, discussion, and debate about the defamatory statements at issue lies at\nthe heart of the case. Accordingly, disclosure of these materials is \"inherent\" in the case itself.\nThe principle that defamatory material in a defamation case cannot be sealed is recognized\nin Carnegie v. Tedder, 698 So.2d 1310 (2d DCA 1997). Carnegie involved a claim and\ncounterclaim between two parties (Carnegie and Tedder), one of whom alleged that disclosure of\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 4 of 20\nthe materials in the records would be harmful to his professional\nreputation. Carnegie recited subsection vi's restriction on release of materials involving a\nprivacy right, but noted that \"statements Tedder alleged were defamatory and damaging were\nallegations in Carnegie's counterclaim for which she seeks damages.\nThese matters were not peripheral to the lawsuit; they were inherent to it.\" Id. at 1312. Of\ncourse, exactly the same principle applies here: sexual abuse allegations filed by attorneys\nEdwards and Cassell for their client Ms. Virginia Giuffre are not peripheral to this lawsuit — they\nare inherent to it.\nTo see how \"inherent\" the sexual abuse allegations are to this lawsuit, the Court need\nlook no further than Dershowitz's counterclaim in this case. Count I of Dershowitz's\nCounterclaim (styled as \"False Allegations in the Joinder Motion) contends that Edwards and\nCassell should pay him damages because they \"filed a pleading in the Federal Action titled 'Jane\nDoe #3 and Jane Doe #4's Motion Pursuant to Rule 21 for Joinder in Action' . . . .\" Dershowitz\nCounterclaim at 11 14. Dershowitz's Counterclaim then goes on to quote at length from the\nJoinder Motion. His counterclaim contains, for example, this paragraph recounting the\nallegations:\nThe Joinder Motion then goes on to allege — without any supporting evidence — as\nfollows:\nOne such powerful individual that Epstein forced then-minor Jane Doe #3 to\nhave sexual relations with was former Harvard Law Professor Alan\nDershowitz, a close friend of Epstein's and well-known criminal defense\nattorney. Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with\nDershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida\nbut also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 5 of 20\nIslands. In addition to being a participant in the abuse of Jane Doe #3 and other\nminors, Dershowitz was an eye-witness to the sexual abuse of many other\nminors by Epstein and several of Epstein's coconspirators. Dershowitz would\nlater play a significant role in negotiating the [Non-Prosecution Agreement] on\nEpstein's behalf. Indeed, Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement that\nprovided immunity from federal prosecution in the Southern District of Florida\nnot only to Epstein, but also to \"any potential coconspirators of Epstein.\" Thus,\nDershowitz helped negotiate an agreement with a provision that provided\nprotection for himself against criminal prosecution in Florida for sexually\nabusing Jane Doe #3. Because this broad immunity wouldhave been\ncontroversial if disclosed, Dershowitz (along with other members of Epstein's\ndefense team) and the Government tried to keep the immunity provision secret\nfrom all of Epstein's victims and the general public, even though such secrecy\nviolated the Crime Victims' Rights Act.\nDershowitz Counterclaim at 1115 (quoting Joinder Motion at 4).\nRemarkably, having quoted at length from the Joinder Motion in his Counterclaim in this\ncase, Dershowitz now seeks to have that very same language from the Joinder Motion deemed\n\"confidential\" and sealed. Compare Counterclaim at ¶15 (block quotation above) with Motion to\nDetermine Confidentiality, Exhibit A at 4 (composite exhibit with proposed \"confidential\"\ndocument that includes paragraph beginning \"[o]ne such powerful individual that Epstein forced\nthen-minor Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with was former Harvard Law Professor Alan\nDershowitz, a close friend of Epstein's . . . .\"). Dershowitz cannot come before this Court and\nfile a counterclaim seeking damages from Edwards and Cassell for alleged defamatory\nstatements and then ask to have those very same statements placed under seal as\n\"confidential.\" See Barron v. Florida Freedom Newspapers, 531 So.2d at 119 (\"although\ngenerally protected by one's privacy right, medical reports and history are no longer protected\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 6 of 20\nwhen the medical condition becomes an integral part of the civil proceeding, particularly when\nthe condition is asserted as an issue by the party seeking closure\" (emphasis added)).\nH. JUDGE MARRA'S ORDER IN HIS CASE DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT\nTHE RECORDS BE SEALED IN THIS CASE.\nDershowitz also appears to contend that Judge Marra's order striking some of the\nmaterials from the records at issue somehow requires that these stricken materials be kept\nconfidential in this case. Dershowitz's argument misunderstands both the scope of Judge\nMarra's order and its effect in this case. His argument rests on a truncated — and misleading --\ndescription of the events surrounding Judge Marra's ruling striking certain documents. A more\ncomplete description makes clear that Judge Marra has not determined the documents are\nsomehow \"confidential\" even in the federal Crime Victims' Rights Act case — much less in this\nseparate state defamation action.\nEdwards and Cassell filed the federal case pro bono on behalf of two young women who\nwere sexually abused as underage girls by Dershowitz's close personal friend — Jeffrey\nEpstein. In 2008, Edwards and Casell filed a petition to enforce the rights of \"Jane Doe No. 1\"\nand \"Jane Doe No. 2\" under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, alleging\nthat the Government had failed to provide them rights with regard to a plea arrangement it was\npursuing with Epstein. Jane Doe No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2 v. United States, No. 9:08-cv-80736\n(S.D. Fla.). In the course of that case, on October 11, 2011, the victims filed discovery requests\nwith the Government, including requests specifically seeking information about Dershowitz,\nPrince Andrew, and others. Further efforts from the Government to avoid any discovery\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 7 of 20\nfollowed (see generally Docket Entry or \"DE\" 225-1 at 4-5), ultimately leading to a further\nCourt ruling in June 2013 that the Government should produce documents. DE 189. The\nGovernment then produced about 1,500 pages of largely irrelevant materials to the victims (DE\n225-1 at 5), while simultaneously submitting 14,825 pages of relevant materials under seal to the\nCourt. The Government claimed that these pages were \"privileged\" for various reasons,\nattaching an abbreviated privilege log.\nWhile these discovery issues were pending, in the summer of 2014, Edwards and Cassell,\ncontacted Government counsel to request their agreement to add two additional victims to the\ncase, including Ms. Virginia Giuffre (who was identified in court pleadings as \"Jane Doe No.\n3\"). Edwards and Cassell sought to have her added to the case via stipulation, which would have\navoided the need to include any detailed facts about her abuse. Weeks went by and the\nGovernment — as it had done on a similar request for a stipulation to add another victim — did not\nrespond to counsel's request for a stipulation. Finally, on December 10, 2014, despite having\nhad four months to provide a position, the Government responded by email to counsel that it was\nseeking more time, indicating that the Government understood that victims' counsel might need\nto file a motion with the court on the matter immediately. DE 291 at 3-5. Rather than file a\nmotion immediately, victims' counsel waited and continued to press the Government for a\nstipulation. See id. at 5. Finally, on December 23, 2014 — more than four months after the initial\nrequest for a stipulated joinder into the case — the Government tersely indicated its objection,\nwithout indicating any reason: \"Our position is that we oppose adding new petitioners at this\nstage of the litigation.\" See DE 291 at 5.\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 8 of 20\nBecause the Government now contested the joinder motion, Edwards and\nCassell prepared a more detailed pleading explaining the justification for granting the\nmotion. One week after receiving the Government's objection, on December 30, 2014, Ms.\nGiuffre (i.e., Jane Doe No. 3) and Jane Doe No. 4 filed a motion (and later a corrected motion)\nseeking to join the case. DE 279 and DE 280. (Note: DE 280 is the first of the three documents\nDershowitz seeks to have declared \"confidential\" in this case.) Uncertain as to the basis for the\nGovernment's objection, the motion briefly proffered the circumstances that would qualify\nthe two women as \"victims\" eligible to assert rights under the CVRA. See 18 U.S.C. 3771(e)\n(defining \"crime victim\" protected under the Act). With regard to Ms. Giuffre, the motion\nindicated that when she was a minor, Jeffrey Epstein had trafficked her to Dershowitz and Prince\nAndrew (among others) for sexual purposes. Jane Doe No. 3 stated that she was prepared to\nprove her proffer. See DE 280 at 3 (\"If allowed to join this action, Jane Doe No. 3 would prove\nthe following .... \"). The motion also provided specific reasons why Jane Doe No. 3's\nparticipation was relevant to the case, including the pending discovery issues regarding\nDershowitz and Prince Andrew. DE 280 at 9-10 (explaining several reasons participation of new\nvictims was relevant to existing issues).\nAfter the motion was filed, various news organizations published articles about\nit. Dershowitz also made numerous media statements about the filing, including calling Jane\nDoe No. 3 \"a serial liar\" who \"has lied through her teeth about many world\nleaders.\" http ://vvww cnn . co m/2015/01/06/us/dershowi tz-sex -all e gati on/. Dershowitz also\nrepeatedly called Edwards and Cassell \"two sleazy, unprofessional, disbarable lawyers.\" Id. On\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 9 of 20\nJanuary 5, 2015, Dershowitz filed a motion to intervene to argue to have the allegations\nstricken. DE 282. Dershowitz also argued that Ms. Giuffre had not provided a sworn affidavit\nattesting to the truth of her allegations. On January 21, 2015, Edwards and Cassell filed a\nresponse for Ms. Giuffre and Jane Doe No. 4. DE 291. (Note: This is the second of the three\ndocuments Dershowitz seeks to have kept under seal here.) The response enumerated nine\nspecific reasons why Ms. Giuffre's specific allegations against Dershowitz were relevant to the\ncase, including the fact that Ms. Giuffre needed to establish that she was a \"victim\" in the case,\nthat pending discovery requests concerning Dershowitz-specific documents were pending, and\nthat Dershowitz's role as a defense attorney in the case was highly relevant to the motive for the\nGovernment and defense counsel to conceal the plea deal from the victims. DE 291 at 17-26 &\nn.17. The response included a detailed affidavit from Ms. Giuffre about the sexual abuse she had\nsuffered from Epstein, Dershowitz, and other powerful persons. DE 291-1. On February 6,\n2015, Edwards and Cassell filed a further pleading (and affidavit from Ms. Giuffre, see DE 291-\n1) in support of her motion to intervene. (Note: this affidavit is the third of the three documents\nDershowitz seeks to have declared confidential.)\nOn April 7, 2015, Judge Marra denied Ms. Giuffi-e's motion to join the case. Judge\nMarra concluded that \"at this juncture in the proceedings\" details about the sexual abuse she had\nsuffered was unnecessary to making a determination \"of whether Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4\nshould be permitted to join [the other victims'] claim that the Government violated their rights\nunder the CVRA. The factual details regarding with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in\nsexual activities are impertinent to this central claim (i.e., that they were known victims of Mr.\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 10 of 20\nEpstein and the Government owed them CVRA duties), especially considering that the details\ninvolve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government.\" DE 324 at 5 (emphasis\nin original). While Judge Marra struck those allegations, he emphasized that \"Jane Doe 3 is free\nto reassert these factual details through proper evidentiary proof, should [the victims]\ndemonstrate a good faith basis for believing that such details are pertinent to a matter presented\nfor the Court's consideration. Judge Marra then denied Ms. Giuffre's motion to join the case,\nbut allowed her to participate as trial witness: \"The necessary 'participation' of [Ms. Giuffre] ...\nin this case can be satisfied by offering ... properly supported — and relevant, admissible, and\nnon-cumulative — testimony as needed, whether through testimony at trial ... or affidavits\nsupported in support [of] the relevancy of discovery requests.\" DE 324 at 8 (emphasis\ndeleted). In a supplemental order, Judge Marra stated that the victims \"may re-refile these\ndocuments omitting the stricken portions.\" DE 325. The victims have recently refiled the\ndocuments.\nIn light of this history, Dershowitz is flatly incorrect when he asserts that \"Judge Marra's\nOrder appropriately precludes the unredacted documents from being re-filed in this case on the\npublic docket.\" Confidentiality Motion at 3. To the contrary, the Order specifically permits\nfactual details about Dershowitz's sexual abuse of Ms. Giuffre to be presented in regard to\npertinent matters in the federal CVRA case. And certainly nothing in Judge Marra's Order could\nrender those documents confidential in this state defamation case, where the central issues swirl\naround Edwards and Cassell's good faith basis for filing the allegations. Indeed, the order is not\nbinding in any way in this case, because it is res judicata only as to Ms. Giuffre (the moving\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 11 of 20\nparty in that case), not as to her attorneys Edwards and Cassell. See Palm AFC Holdings, Inc. v.\nPalm Beach County, 807 So.2d 703 (4th DCA 2002) (\"In order for res judicata to apply four\nidentities must be present: (1) identity of the thing sued for; (2) identity of the cause of action;\n(3) identity of persons and parties; and (4) identity of the quality or capacity of the persons for or\nagainst whom the claim is made.\").\nIII. EDWARDS AND CASSELL WILL BE PREJUDICED IF THEY ARE\nBARRED FROM QUOTING FROM THE RECORD WHILE\nDERSHOWITZ IS PERMITTED TO FREELY REFER TO THEM\nWHENEVER HE FINDS IT CONVENIENT.\nDershowitz is also incorrect when he asserts that no prejudice will befall Edwards and\nCassell if the records are placed under seal. To the contrary, placing the documents under seal\nwould permit Dershowitz to continue to misrepresent and distort what is contained in those\nrecords while preventing Edwards and Cassell from correcting those misrepresentations.\nDershowitz has repeatedly referred to details in the records when he has found it convenient to\ndo so — treating the records as not confidential in any away. One clear example comes from\nDershowitz's recent deposition, where he gratuitously injected into the record a reference to a\nportion of Ms. Giuffre's affidavit about him watching Ms. Giuffre perform oral sex on\nEpstein. And then, having injected that gratuitous reference into the record, he proceeded to try\nto rebut the reference with confidential settlement discussions — but did so by mispresenting what\nanother attorney (David Boies) had said during the settlement discussions. So that the Court may\nhave the full flavor of the exchange, the narrow question to Dershowitz (by attorney Jack\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 12 of 20\nScarola) and Dershowitz's extended answer are quoted in full — including Dershowitz's\nreference to the oral sex allegation that he now argues this Court should treat as \"confidential\":\nQ. [Y]ou [are] aware that years before December of 2014, when the\nCVRA pleading was filed, that your name had come up repeatedly in\nconnection with Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minors, correct? . . .\nA. Let me answer that question. I am aware that never before 2014,\nend of December, was it ever, ever alleged that I had acted in any\nway inappropriately with regard to Virginia [Giuffre], that I ever\ntouched her, that I ever met her, that Ihad ever been with her. I was\ncompletely aware of that. There had never been any\nallegation. She claims under oath that she told you that secretly in\n2011, but you have produced no notes of any such conversation.\nYou, of course, are a witness to this allegation and will be deposed\nas a witness to this allegation. I believe it is an entirely false\nallegation that she told you in 2011 that she had had any sexual\ncontact with me. I think she's lying through her teeth when she\nsays that. And I doubt that your notes will reveal any such\ninformation.\nBut if she did tell you that, she would be absolutely, categorically\nlying. So I am completely aware that never, until the lies were put\nin a legal pleading at the end of December 2014, it was\nnever alleged that I had any sexual contact with Virginia Roberts.\nI know that it was alleged that I was a witness to Jeffrey Epstein's\nalleged abuse and that was false. I was never a witness to any of\nJeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse. And I wrote that to you, something\nthat you have falsely denied. And I stand on the record. The record\nis clear that I have categorically denied I was ever a witness to\nany abuse, that I ever saw Jeffrey Epstein abusing anybody.\nAnd -- and the very idea that I would stand and talk to Jeffrey\nEpstein while he was receiving oral sex from Virginia Roberts,\nwhich she swore to under oath, is so outrageous, so preposterous,\nthat even David Boies said he couldn't believe it was true.\nMS. McCAWLEY: I object. I object. I'm not going to allow you to reveal\nany conversations that happened in the context of a settlement discussion.\nTHE WITNESS: Does she have standing?\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 13 of 20\nMS. McCAWLEY: I have a standing objection and, I'm objecting again. I'm\nnot going to\nTHE WITNESS: No, no, no. Does she have standing in this deposition?\nMR. SCOTT: Let's take a break for a minute, okay?\nTHE WITNESS: I'm not sure she has standing.\nMR. SCAROLA: Are we finished with the speech?\nMR. SCOTT: No. If he --\nMR. SCAROLA: I'd like him to finish the speech so that we can get to my\nquestion\nand then we can take a break.\nA. So the question -- the answer to your question is --\nMR. SIMPSON: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Please don't\ndisclose something that she has a right to raise that objection if she wants to.\nMR. SCOTT: Exactly.\nDeposition of Alan Dershowitz (Oct. 15, 2015) at 93-95 (attached as Exhibit 1); see\nalso Deposition of Alan Dershowitz (Oct. 16, 2016) (attached as Exhibit 2) (also containing\ndiscussion of Ms. Giuffre's affidavit).\nThe Court should be aware that within approximately two hours of this exchange, Ms.\nMcCawley (David Boies' law partner) released a statement on his behalf, which stated that\nDershowitz was misrepresenting what happened: \"Because the discussions that Mr. Boies had\nwith Mr. Dershowitz were expressly privileged settlement discussions, Mr. Boies will not, at\nleast at this time, describe what was actually said. However, Mr. Boies does state that Mr.\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 14 of 20\nDershowitz description of what was said is not true.\" Statement of Ms. McCawley on Behalf of\nDavid Boies (Oct. 15, 2015).\nMore broadly, the Court can readily see from this passage how Dershowitz is willing to\ninject into the record a part of Ms. Giuffre's affidavit whenever it serves his purpose — and,\nindeed, to characterize the part of the affidavit as \"preposterous.\" But then he asks this Court to\nplace the underlying affidavit under seal, so that the Edwards and Cassell stand accused having\nfiled a \"preposterous\" affidavit without anyone being able to assess the validity of Dershowitz's\nattack.\nDershowitz has referred to the court records that he now wishes to have the Court declare\nconfidential not only in his deposition, but also in his widely-broadcast media attacks on\nEdwards and Cassell. For example, Dershowitz appeared on the British Broadcasting\nCorporation (the BBC) and was asked about the allegations:\nWell, first of all they were made in court papers that they don't even ask for a hearing\nto try to prove them. They put them in court papers in order to immunize themselves\nfrom any consequences from a defamation suit. The story is totally made\nup, completely out of whole cloth.\nI don't know this woman. I was not at the places at the times. It is part of a pattern of\nmade up stories against prominent people and world leaders. And the lawyers in\nrecent statement challenged me to deny the allegations under oath. I am doing that. I\nam denying them under oath, thus subjecting me to a perjury prosecution were I not\ntelling the truth. I am now challenging them to have their client put these charges\nunder oath and for them to put them under oath. I am also challenging them to repeat\nthem outside of the context of court papers so that I can sue them for defamation. . . .\nAnd I will prove beyond any doubt not only that the story is totally false, but it was\nknowingly false: that the lawyers and the client conspired together to create a false\nstory. That is why I am moving for their disbarment in challenges to be provided to\nthe disciplinary committee.\nBBC Radio 4 - Sarah Montague (Jan. 3, 2015) (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02g7qbc).\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 15 of 20\nSimilarly, Dershowitz appeared on NBC's Today Show the morning after Edwards and\nCassell made a filing for Ms. Giuffre, to say that the Edwards and Cassell — and Ms. Giuffre —\nwere all \"lying\" in the court documents:\nQuestion from Savannah Guthrie: In legal papers from the lawyers, they say you've\nhad, in fact, the opportunity to be deposed.\nAnswer from Alan Dershowitz: They're lying. They're lying.\nQuestion: They show letters in which they offered to depose you.\nAnswer: And they didn't show my letters in response saying, (a), if you ask me about\nmy legal relationship with Epstein and I'll be happy to answer. . . . And I responded\nthat I would be happy to be deposed if you could give me any indication that I would\nbe a relevant witness . . . . They will be proved — all of them [i.e., Cassell, Edwards,\nand Ms. Giuffre] — to be categorically lying and making up this story. And it will be a\nterrible thing for rape victims. . . . We [Epstein and Dershowitz] had an academic\nrelationship. I was never in the presence of a single, young, underaged\nwoman. When I was with him, it was with prominent scientists, prominent\nacademics. And they're just — again — lying about this. I never saw him doing\nanything improper. I was not a participant. I was not a witness.\nToday Show, Jan. 22, 2015 (emphases added).\nAs another example, in Miami Herald, Dershowitz called the Joinder Motion that he\nseeks to have sealed the sleaziest legal document I have ever seen. They [Edwards and\nCassell] manipulated a young, suggestible woman who was interested in money. This is a\ndisbarrable offense, and they will be disbarred. They will rue the day they ever made this false\ncharge against me\" — i.e., Edwards and Cassell will \"rue the day\" they ever filed the Joinder\nMotion. Miami Herald (Jan. 3, 2015).\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 16 of 20\nMost remarkably, Dershowitz took the public airwaves to represent that he wanted all of\nthe information surrounding the allegations to \"be made public,\" while implying that Edwards\nand Cassell had something to hide. For example, on the BBC he claimed that he\nwanted\"everything to be made public\":\nQ: Would you encourage that it now be made public?\nA: Of course, of course. I want everything to be made public. I want\nevery bit of evidence in this case to be made public. I want every\nallegation to be made public. I want to know who else she's accused of\nthese horrible crimes. We know that she accused Bill Clinton of being on\nJeffrey Epstein's island and participating in sex orgy with underage\ngirls. The records of the Secret Service will prove that President Clinton\nnever set foot on that island. So that she lied. Now it's possible to have a\ncase of mistaken identification with somebody like me. It's impossible to\nhave a case of mistaken identification with Bill Clinton.\nMy only feeling is that if she has lied about me, which I know to an\nabsolute certainty she has, she should not be believed about anyone\nelse. She's lied clearly about me, she's lied clearly about Bill\nClinton. We know that. We know that she's lied about other public\nfigures, including a former prime minister and others who she claims to\nhave participated in sexual activities with. So I think it must be presumed\nthat all of her allegations against Prince Andrew are false as well.\nI think he [Prince Andrew] should clear the air as well.\nIf you're squeaky clean and if you have never done anything like this, you\nmust fight back with all the resources available to you. And that's what I\nwill do. I will not rest or stop until the world understands no only that I\nhad nothing to do with any of this, but that she deliberately, with the\nconnivance of her lawyer, lawyers, made up this story willfully and\nknowingly.\nBBC Radio 4 - Sarah Montague (Jan. 3, 2015) (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02g7qbc).\nIn another widely-broadcast interview on CNN, Dershowitz implied that there is no\nevidence supporting the allegations against him:\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 17 of 20\nAsk them [Edwards and Cassell] if they have any evidence . . . . They're doing it for\nmoney. She's getting money for having sold her story. She wants to sell the book.\nThey're trying to get into this lawsuit. They see a pot of gold at the end of the\nrainbow. They're [Edwards and Cassell] prepared to lie, cheat, and steal. These are\nunethical lawyers. This is Professor Cassell who shouldn't be allowed near a\nstudent. This is Professor Cassell, who is a former federal judge, thank God he no\nlonger wears a robe. He is essentially a crook. He is essentially somebody who's\ndistorted the legal profession. . . . Why would he charge a person with a\nsterling reputation for 50 years on the basis of the word alone of a woman who is\nserial liar, who has lied about former Prime Ministers, former Presidents, has lied\ndemonstrably.\nCNN Live (with Hala Gorani) (January 5, 2015). Of course, by placing \"the evidence\" in this\ncase under seal, Dershowitz will be free to continue to try and insinuate that Edward and Cassell\n— and their client, Ms. Giuffre — had no evidence supporting the allegations against him, even\nthough a mountain evidence strongly support Ms. Giuffre 's allegations. See Deposition of Paul\nCassell (Oct. 16, 2015) at 61-117 (Exhibit 3); see also Depo of Pual Cassell (Oct. 17, 2015)\n(Exhibit 4).\nCONCLUSION\nThe Court should deny Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff Alan Dershowitz's motion to\nplace documents regarding Ms. Giuffre's allegations against him under seal.\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that a true and correct copy of the foregoing was sent via E-Serve\nto all Counsel on the attached list, this 25f-‘' day of November, 2015.\n/s/ Jack Scarola\nJack Scarola\nFlorida Bar No.: 169440\nAttorney E-Mail(s): jsxasearcylaw.com and\nmep@searcylaw.com\nPrimary E-Mail: scarolateamasearcylaw.com\nSearcy Denney Scarola Barnhart & Shipley, P.A.\n2139 Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard\nWest Palm Beach, Florida 33409\nPhone:(561) 686-6300\nFax:(561) 383-9451\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 18 of 20\nSEAN D.

KLC’s management believes its large, combined\nnationwide center base gives it the ability to leverage the costs of programs and services, such as\ncurriculum development, training programs and other management processes.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2005, KLC experienced a reduction in projected claims costs for its self-insurance\nprograms. However, management anticipates that premium and claims costs will continue to refiect\nmarket forces, which are beyond KLC’s control.\n\nThe Real Estate Transaction did not affect consolidated rent expense, but resulted in an increase of\napproximately $96.0 million in annual rent expense of KLC OpCo, which is leasing centers from KLC\nPropCo which now has title to substantially all of KLC's owned real property.\n\nOther Operating Expenses\n\nKLC’'s other operating expenses include the costs associated with the field management and corporate\noversight and support of its centers and resiructuring related expenses. Labor related costs are the\nlargest component of KLC's general and administrative expenses.\n\nSeasonality\n\nNew enrollments are generally highest during the traditional fall “back to schocl” period and after the\ncalendar year-end holidays. KLC attempts to focus its marketing efforts to support these periods of high\nreenrallments. Enrollment generally decreases somewhat during the summer months and the calendar\nyear-end holidays.\n\nResuits Discussion\nRevenue increased to $1.48 billion in 2005, which represents an increase of $35.6 million over 2004.\nGross margin was $340.7 million during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $11.1\n\nmillion, or 3.4%, compared to the same period last year.
