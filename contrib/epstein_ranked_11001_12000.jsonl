When I turned to answer one of the bigoted chants, as I always do in these\nsituations, the police officer in charge gently but firmly insisted that I walk directly to my car and\nnot engage them. It was an order, reasonably calculated to assure my safety, and it was right.\n\nThe officer climbed into my car with me and only got out a few blocks away, when we were\nbeyond the range of violence. The intimidation had succeeded. I had been silenced, and the false\nand horrible message had gone unanswered in the plaza near Faneuil Hall.\n\nI have experienced similar hatred around the world: in California, Toronto, Trondheim, Cape\ntown, London and Paris. I needed police protection—sometimes with shields and bulletproof\nvests—when I spoke about Israel. I never saw anything like this hatred directed at the South\nAfrican Apartheid regime in the 1970s and 1980s. Even during the worst days of McCarthyism,\nthere was nothing like this even directed at Stalin’s Soviet Union or Mao’s China. And there was\nnothing like this directed at the German Nazi regime or the Italian Fascist regime in the 1930s.\n\nThe hatred directed at Israel—calling it worse than Nazi Germany and Apartheid South\nAfrica—is sui genesis. It is unprecedented on campuses around the world, and it was inevitable\nthat it would cross the line into old fashioned and crude anti-Semitism, as it has done on many\ncampuses and in many lecture halls.\n\nI could not remain silent in the face of this dangerous phenomenon. I decided therefore to\nprioritize my legal and human rights work in defense of Israel and the Jewish community as long\nas this threat persisted.\n\nI had wanted to write a book called 7he Case For Peace, in which I criticized both sides of the\nArab-Israeli conflict for not doing enough to bring about a compromise peace. Instead, I decided\nto write Zhe Case For Israel, in order to provide students with a factual basis for responding to\nthe untruths that are rampant on campuses. The book became an instant best seller, both on\ncampuses and around the world, where it was published in many languages. It helped change the\nterms of the debate on many campuses and it changed the minds of many people. One example is\nparticularly gratifying. An Arab man named Kassim Hafeez wrote an article in October of 2011\nentitled From Anti-Semite to Zionist. In it, he described his journey as follows:\n\n“Growing up in a Muslim community in the UK I was exposed to materials condemning\nIsrael, painting Jews as usurpers and murderers. My views were reinforced when I\nattended Nakba Day rallies where speakers predicted Israel's demise.\n\nMy hate for Israel and for the Jews was fuelled by images of death and destruction, set to\nthe backdrop of Arabic melodies about Jihad and speeches of Hizbollah leader Hasan\n\nNasrallah or Osama Bin Laden.\n\nThere was also constant, casual antisemitism around me. My father would boast of how\nAdolf Hitler was a hero, his only failing being that he didn't kill enough Jews.\n\n354\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017441\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Frank Rosenblatt invented a learning\ndevice he called the perceptron, which was a one-layer neural network. In the late sixties,\nMarvin Minsky and Seymour Papert wrote a book titled Perceptrons, in which they\nbasically proved that perceptrons couldn’t do anything interesting, which is correct.\nPerceptrons could only make linear distinctions between things. So the idea was more or\nless dropped. People said, “These guys have written a proof that neural networks can’t\ndo anything interesting, therefore no neural networks can do anything interesting, so let’s\nforget about neural networks.” That attitude persisted for some time.\n\nMeanwhile, there were a couple of other approaches to AI. One was based on\nunderstanding, at a formal level, symbolically, how the world works; and the other was\nbased on doing statistics and probabilistic kinds of things. With regard to symbolic AI,\none of the test cases was, Can we teach a computer to do something like integrals? Can\nwe teach a computer to do calculus? There were tasks like machine translation, which\npeople thought would be a good example of what computers could do. The bottom line is\nthat by the early seventies, that approach had crashed.\n\nThen there was a trend toward devices called expert systems, which arose in the\nlate seventies and early eighties. The idea was to have a machine learn the rules that an\nexpert uses and thereby figure out what to do. That petered out. After that, AI became\nlittle more than a crazy pursuit.\n\nI had been interested in how you make an AJI-like machine since I was a kid. I was\ninterested particularly in how you take the knowledge we humans have accumulated in\nour civilization and automate answering questions on the basis of that knowledge. I\nthought about how you could do that symbolically, by building a system that could break\ndown questions into symbolic units and answer them. I worked on neural networks at\nthat time and didn’t make much progress, so I put it aside for a while.\n\nBack in mid-2002 to 2003, I thought about that question again: What does it take\nto make a computational knowledge system? The work I’d done by then pretty much\nshowed that my original belief about how to do this was completely wrong. My original\nbelief had been that in order to make a serious computational knowledge system, you first\nhad to build a brainlike device and then feed it knowledge—just as humans learn in\nstandard education. Now I realized that there wasn’t a bright line between what is\nintelligent and what is simply computational.\n\nI had assumed that there was some magic mechanism that made us vastly more\ncapable than anything that was just computational. But that assumption was wrong. This\ninsight is what led to Wolfram|Alpha. What I discovered is that you can take a large\ncollection of the world’s knowledge and automatically answer questions on the basis of\nit, using what are essentially merely computational techniques. It was an alternative way\nto do engineering—a way that’s much more analogous to what biology does in evolution.\n\nIn effect, what you normally do when you build a program 1s build it step-by-step.\nBut you can also explore the computational universe and mine technology from that\nuniverse. Typically, the challenge is the same as in physical mining: That is, you find a\nsupply of, let’s say, iron, or cobalt, or gadolinium, with some special magnetic properties,\n\n184\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016987\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

At approximately 10:00 pm, I attempted contact with\nMr. Rodriguez and discovered he was assisting his wife at her place of\nemployment and would not be able to meet with me. Mr. Rodriguez\nstated he would meet with me on January 6, 2006, in Broward County, in\nthe morning hours.\n\nOn January 6, 2006, at approximately 9:00 am, I received a telephone\ncall from Mr. Rodriguez who advised he had the file in hand and would\nbe traveling northbound to meet with me in Broward County. At 10:50\nam, I met with Alfredo Rodriguez at the parking lot of Bank of America\nin Boca Raton on Yamato Road and Military Trail (known as the Polo\nCenter). Rodriguez produced a green folder which contained documents,\n\na note with Mr. Epstein's stationary with direction to deliver a\nbucket of roses tol Jafter[..__]\nhigh school drama performance.

Probably this will be a context involving a\nfriendly person.\n\ne PLN-based goal refinement is used to create new subgoals G to sit on the right hand side\nof instances of the cognitive schematic.\n\n— Example: Given that a virtual dog has a goal of finding food, it may learn a subgoal of\nfollowing other dogs, due to observing that other dogs are often heading toward their\n\nfood.\n\ne Concept formation heuristics are used for choosing G and for fueling goal refinement, but\nespecially for choosing C (via providing new candidates for C). They are also used for\nchoosing P, via a process called “predicate schematization” that turns logical predicates\n(declarative knowledge) into procedures.\n\n— Example: At first a virtual dog may have a hard time predicting which other dogs are\ngoing to be mean to it. But it may eventually observe common features among a number\nof mean dogs, and thus form its own concept of “pit bull,” without anyone ever teaching\nit this concept explicitly.\n\nWhere analysis is concerned:\n\ne PLN inference, acting on declarative knowledge, is used for estimating the probability of\nthe implication in the cognitive schematic, given fixed C, P and G. Episodic knowledge\nis also used this regard, via enabling estimation of the probability via simple similarity\nmatching against past experience. Simulation is also used: multiple simulations may be\nrun, and statistics may be captured therefrom.\n\n— Example: To estimate the degree to which asking Bob for food (the procedure P is “asking\nfor food”, the context C is “being with Bob”) will achieve the goal G of getting food, the\nvirtual dog may study its memory to see what happened on previous occasions where it\nor other dogs asked Bob for food or other things, and then integrate the evidence from\nthese occasions.\n\nProcedural knowledge, mapped into declarative knowledge and then acted on by PLN in-\nference, can be useful for estimating the probability of the implication C A P > G, in cases\nwhere the probability of C A P, > G is known for some P, related to P.\n\n— Example: knowledge of the internal similarity between the procedure of asking for food\nand the procedure of asking for toys, allows the virtual dog to reason that if asking Bob\nfor toys has been successful, maybe asking Bob for food will be successful too.\n\nInference, acting on declarative or sensory knowledge, can be useful for estimating the\nprobability of the implication C A P > G, in cases where the probability of Cy A P > G is\nknown for some C} related to C.\n\n— Example: if Bob and Jim have a lot of features in common, and Bob often responds\npositively when asked for food, then maybe Jim will too.\n\nInference can be used similarly for estimating the probability of the implication CA P > G,\nin cases where the probability of C A P > G, is known for some G, related to G.

This book doesn’t say how. It will open that can of worms, and others\n\ntoo, and try to track some but not all to their destinations. One look leads to another.\n\nThis shows that I’m not an optimist in the sense of making rosy predictions. But I\nseem to show that bias in evaluations. I’m two thirds Panglossian. (Doctor Pangloss\nwas the guy in Voltaire’s Candide who said that this is the best of all possible\nworlds.) I side with the good doctor in that I cannot imagine an improvement to this\nworld or to the human race. I see the dangers and evils, such as Armageddonists, as\nsomehow part of the scheme. The world would not be better if it posed no threats\nand challenges to solve. To solve them is not to wish them away. The stories of\nAladdin’s lamp and the monkey’s paw tell us that each wish after the first is to undo\nthe one before. I think that’s what Shaw was telling us in Don Juan in Hell. Don Juan\nand the others are free to go to heaven whenever they like, and occasionally do.\n\nThey come back because they can’t stand the boredom.\n\nWhere I find fault, and differ with Pangloss, is as to the doctrines we are taught.\nWhatever | study, I seem to find a good measure of nonsense taught along with\nwisdom. This book is about what | find of both in economics. And a problem | try to\nsolve, not wish away, is the danger of losing sight of the points on which Pangloss\n\nwas right. My verse and music try to remind us.\n\nAnd [Il admit a bias for the surprises my title promises. I love upending what we\nhad all assumed. Fun! And all the more fun when | can show that famous economists\nhad already seen and said some of the same things I do when we read those\neconomists again. Surprise need not be true novelty. My free growth theory is really\nJohn Stuart Mill’s, although no one seems to have noticed the paragraph I quote\nfrom him. My next generation theory really belongs to my 17%-century rhymesake\nSir WilliamPetty, who happens to be my nominee for greatest economist of all time.\nIn a way, I could also credit it to the period of production theorists John Rae, Nassau\nSenior, William Stanley Jevons and Eugen von Boehm Bawerk. They need only to\n\nhave considered human and total capital as explained by Petty two centuries before.\n\nForward By The Author 04/18/16 3\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010915\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Open to every citizen, the system provides students with free education, books and health\nservices. The government allocates over 25% of the annual State budget to education.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Education, Saudi Arabia prizes education because of its critical importance in\ndeveloping the country's human potential. Education is a central aspect of family and community life.\nParents are deeply involved in their children's education, and the close links between home and school\nserve to reinforce the structure of the community and the nation.\n\nThe government plans to increase the enrollment of 4 to 6-year-olds to 40% by 2014. Additionally, by\nroyal decree, education is now required for all 4-year-olds. New labor laws also necessitate that\ncompanies employing 50 or more women provide daycare centers. Despite this new series of laws, there\nstill only exist 1,200 kindergarten schools in Saudi Arabia (42% private and 58% public) to support the\nlegislative pronouncements. The Company anticipates that, additional capacity will be needed to meet\nthese social objectives. These trends, as noted by the Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia have led to\nprivate education facilities opening all over the Kingdom.\n\n8.5.3. United Kingdom: Market Overview\n\nThe United Kingdom stands out with consistent rises in its investment in education, not just in absolute\nterms, but also relative to national income: Spending on educational institutions increased from 4.3% of\nGDP in 1990 to 5.5% in 1995 and 5.9% in 2002. From 1995 to 2002, spending and enrollment in primary\nand secondary education has also increased by 36% and 21%, respectively.” Additionally, the country\ninvests almost twice as much as any other country at the pre-primary level.

With knowledge-based programming, we have a way of creating an actual\nrepresentation of real things in the world, in a precise and symbolic way. Not only is it\nunderstandable by brains and communicable to other brains and to computers, it’s also\nimmediately executable.\n\nJust as natural language gave us civilization, knowledge-based programming will\ngive us—what? One bad answer is that it will give us the civilization of the Als. That’s\nwhat we don’t want to happen, because the Als will do a great job communicating with\none another and we’ll be left out of it, because there’s no intermediate language, no\ninterface with our brains. What will this fourth level of knowledge communication lead\nto? If you were Caveman Ogg and you were just realizing that language was starting,\ncould you imagine the coming of civilization? What should we be imagining right now?\n\nThis relates to the question of what the world would look like if most people\ncould code. Clearly, many trivial things would change: Contracts would be written in\ncode, restaurant recipes might be written in code, and so on. Simple things like that\nwould change. But much more profound things would also change. The rise of literacy\ngave us bureaucracy, for example, which had already existed but dramatically\naccelerated, giving us a greater depth of governmental systems, for better or worse. How\ndoes the coding world relate to the cultural world?\n\nTake high school education. If we have computational thinking, how does that\naffect how we study history? How does that affect how we study languages, social\nstudies, and so on? The answer is, it has a great effect. Imagine you’re writing an essay.\nToday, the raw material for a typical high school student’s essay is something that’s\nalready been written; students usually can’t generate new knowledge easily. But in the\ncomputational world, that will no longer be true. If the students know something about\nwriting code, they’ll access all that digitized historical data and figure out something\nnew. Then they’ll write an essay about something they’ve discovered. The achievement\nof knowledge-based programming is that it’s no longer sterile, because it’s got the\nknowledge of the world knitted into the language you’ re using to write code.\n\nThere’s computation all over the universe: in a turbulent fluid producing some\ncomplicated pattern of flow, in the celestial mechanics of planetary interactions, in\nbrains. But does computation have a purpose? You can ask that about any system. Does\nthe weather have a goal? Does climate have a goal?\n\nCan someone looking at Earth from space tell that there’s anything with a purpose\nthere? Is there a civilization there? In the Great Salt Lake, in Utah, there’s a straight\nline. It turns out to be a causeway dividing two areas of the lake with different colors of\nalgae, so it’s a very dramatic straight line. There’s a road in Australia that’s long and\nstraight. There’s a railroad in Siberia that’s long, and lights go on when a train stops at\nthe stations. So from space you can see straight lines and patterns.\n\nBut are these clear enough examples of obvious purpose on Earth as viewed from\nspace? For that matter, how do we recognize extraterrestrials out there? How do we tell\nif a signal we’re getting indicates purpose? Pulsars were discovered in 1967, when we\npicked up a periodic flutter every second or so.

But pierce his\nair of mystery and the picture changes. Vicky Ward explores Epstein’s investment career, his ties\nto retail magnate Leslie Wexner, and his complicated past.\n\nby\n\ne Vicky Ward\n\nJune 27, 2011 12:00 am\n\nOn Manhattan’s Upper East Side, home to some of the most expensive real estate on earth, exists\nthe crown jewel of the city’s residential town houses. With its 15-foot-high oak door, huge\narched windows, and nine floors, it sits on—or, rather, commands—the block of 71st Street\nbetween Fifth and Madison Avenues. Almost ludicrously out of proportion with its four- and\nfive-story neighbors, it seems more like an institution than a house. This is perhaps not\nsurprising—until 1989 it was the Birch Wathen private school. Now it is said to be Manhattan’s\nlargest private residence.\n\nInside, amid the flurry of menservants attired in sober black suits and pristine white gloves, you\nfeel you have stumbled into someone’s private Xanadu. This is no mere rich person’s home, but\na high-walled, eclectic, imperious fantasy that seems to have no boundaries.\n\nThe entrance hall is decorated not with paintings but with row upon row of individually framed\neyeballs; these, the owner tells people with relish, were imported from England, where they were\nmade for injured soldiers. Next comes a marble foyer, which does have a painting, in the manner\nof Jean Dubuffet ... but the host coyly refuses to tell visitors who painted it. In any case, guests\nare like pygmies next to the nearby twice-life-size sculpture of a naked African warrior.\n\nDespite its eccentricity the house is curiously impersonal, the statement of someone who wants\nto be known for the scale of his possessions. Its occupant, financier Jeffrey Epstein, 50, admits to\nfriends that he likes it when people think of him this way. A good-looking man, resembling\nRalph Lauren, with thick gray-white hair and a weathered face, he usually dresses in jeans, knit\nshirts, and loafers. He tells people he bought the house because he knew he “could never live\nanywhere bigger.” He thinks 51,000 square feet is an appropriately large space for someone like\nhimself, who deals mostly in large concepts—especially large sums of money.\n\nGuests are invited to lunch or dinner at the town house—Epstein usually refers to the former as\n“tea,” since he likes to eat bite-size morsels and drink copious quantities of Earl Grey. (He does\nnot touch alcohol or tobacco.) Tea is served in the “leather room,” so called because of the\n\ncordovan-colored fabric on the walls. The chairs are covered in a leopard print, and on the wall\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018000\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This meant frequent meetings with members of the\nanalysis teams. For the first six months or so, I barely uttered a word in these\nsessions. I listened, not just absorbing the information but getting to understand\nthe way the analysts worked and thought.\n\nOur whole intelligence department was responsible for drafting an annual\nstrategic assessment for the army and the government.

This was in approximately the\nsummer of 1996. I went to Ohio and stayed at the property to work on the art\nprojects. I was also babysitting my two younger brother’s and they were staying\nwith me at Wexner’s mansion.\n\nIn addition to my two younger brothers, I also had a younger sister who was fifteen\n(15) years old. Maxwell and Epstein took an interest in my younger sister. Epstein\ntook us to a movie in New York and during the movie he held my younger sister’s\nhand and was rubbing her in a sexual manner without my knowledge. He then\ncontacted my mother and said he wanted to help put my younger sister through a\nspecial school program in Thailand. During the summer of 1996, Epstein and\nMaxwell flew my younger sister to their ranch in New Mexico. She was only\nfifteen (15) at the time and they directed her take off all of her clothes and get on a\nmassage table. Maxwell and Epstein then touched her inappropriately on the\nmassage table. It was not until later in the summer when I called my sister in\nThailand where she was studying that I learned what had happened to her at\nEpstein’s New Mexico ranch.\n\nDuring that same summer of 1996 when I was working on my art project at\nWexner’s mansion, Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein came to Wexner’s\nmansion. They asked me to come into a bedroom with them and then proceeded to\nsexually assault me against my will. I fled from the room and called the sheriff's\noffice but did not get any response. The Wexner’s security staff refused to let me\nleave the property. I pleaded with them and my father drover up from Kentucky to\nOhio to help me. I was held against my will for approximately twelve (12) hours\nuntil I was ultimately allowed to leave with my father. Upon my return to New\nYork, I went to the New York Sixth Precinct police department for help and they\ncounseled me to contact the FBI to make a report about the assault in Ohio. I called\nthe FBI and made the report but to my knowledge, the FBI did not take any action\nagainst Epstein or Maxwell. To my knowledge I was the first person to report\nMaxwell and Epstein to the FBI. It took a significant amount of bravery for me to\nmake that call because I knew how incredibly powerful and influential both Epstein\nand Maxwell were particularly in the art community.\n\nAfter the sexual assault, Maxwell and Epstein called me multiple times threatening\nme. Maxwell and Epstein contacted my art clients and individuals in the art\ncommunity in an effort to ruin my art career. Maxwell and Epstein were successful\nand J was shut out of all art related opportunities. Maxwell and Epstein worked in\nconcert to make sure that my career and my life was ruined. I was terrified of\nMaxwell and Epstein and I moved a number of times to try to hide from them.\n\nI have struggled throughout my life as a direct result of Epstein and Maxwell’s\nactions against me and my hope is that they will be held accountable for their\ncrimes.

From his experience as a frontline\ncommander — in 1956, 1967 and 1973 — he knew the dunes and wadis and\nsprawling expanses of sand as well as any general in Israel. Watching our\nintricate mini-war draw to its close, he made no effort to hide his enthusiasm for\nthe kind of quick, assertive battlefield maneuvers he’d long championed. But\nmore than that, his closest aide soon began sounding me out on my views about\nthe long-term organization, force balance and funding for the Israeli military. A\nfew weeks later, Arik offered me a promotion: a return to the kirya, as a two-\nstar general, to become head of planning for the armed forces.\n\nI don’t know why he chose me: the Sinai exercise perhaps, the fact he knew\nI'd studied “large and complex organizations” at Stanford, or maybe just the\nfact our paths had first crossed two decades earlier when I was in Sayeret\nMatkal. But even though it meant leaving my division command, especially\ntough since the final Sinai withdrawal was approaching, it was an offer I never\ncontemplated turning down. Not just because of the second star on my uniform.\nEver since the 1973 war, along with a few other senior officers including Dan\nShomron, I had been making the case for a shift to more mobile and less\nvulnerable forces and weapons systems. I saw the new role as a chance to help\nencourage that critically important change.\n\nThere was just one hitch: all senior military assignments required the formal\napproval of the chief-of-staff, my old friend Raful Eitan. Raful did manage to\ndelay things for several weeks. At one point, he even brought to bear a quality\nI’d never suspected he had: a sense of humor. “OK, Pll agree to promote\nBarak,” he told Arik. The next day, he said he’d meant /itan Barak — a very\ngood commander, by the way, who had been one of my instructors in officers’\nschool. Arik insisted, however. My appointment went through.\n\nAnd one, unanticipated result was that I didn’t just play the field command\nrole I’d anticipated, from our Cinerama deployments, in Arik’s toweringly\nambitious, ill-planned and ultimately disastrous war in Lebanon.

Supplementary readings will be summarized in \nclass but are not required. \nProblem Sets: \nStudents are encouraged to work with others on the problem sets, and it is permissible to hand in a \nsingle answer sheet for up to three students, with all three receiving the same group grade. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019396 \nCourse Requirements: \n• Midterm: Wednesday October 14 (in-class, closed book; but exam will provide most of the \nbasic formulas you might require, to lessen need for memorization). Analytical problems \non the exam will closely parallel material covered in problem sets (but will generally \nrequire much less algebra), and the essay problem will relate to a central topic covered \nextensively in class. \n• Final: The final will have a larger essay component than the mid-term. The final will draw \non the entire course, though any technical material on the final will be closely related to \nmaterial covered in Problem Set III. \n• Short policy paper: You will be asked to write a short policy paper on a topic drawn from \na list of questions relating to reform of the international monetary system. A one-page \noutline of your paper is due on Wednesday, October 28 or before my first meeting with \nyour group, whichever is earlier, and the complete paper is due on Monday November 16. \nThese papers will form the basis for class discussions and (depending on class size) in-\nclass presentations during the final four meetings of the class.

This allows\nus to formally capture the notion presented in [Goe93a] of intelligence as “the ability to achieve\ncomplex goals in complex environments.”\n\nIf the agent is acting in environment jz, and is provided with g, corresponding to g at the\nstart and the end of the time-interval T = {i € (s,...,¢)}, then the expected goal-achievement\nof the agent, relative to g, during the interval is the expectation\n\nt\nViiaT = OD T(Ig,s,i))\n1=s\nwhere the expectation is taken over all interaction sequences J, ., drawn according to pp. We\nthen propose\n\nDefinition 5 The pragmatic general intelligence of an agent 7, relative to the distribution\nvy over environments and the distribution y over goals, is its expected performance with respect\nto goals drawn from y in environments drawn from v, over the time-scales natural to the goals;\nthat is,\n\nHEE GEG,T\n\n(in those cases where this sum is convergent).\n\nThis definition formally captures the notion that “intelligence is achieving complex goals in\ncomplex environments,” where “complexity” is gauged by the assumed measures v and 4.\n\nIf v is taken to be the universal distribution, and + is defined to weight goals according to\nthe universal distribution, then pragmatic general intelligence reduces to universal intelligence.\n\nFurthermore, it is clear that a universal algorithmic agent like ATXT [Hut05] would also\nhave a high pragmatic general intelligence, under fairly broad conditions. As the interaction\nhistory grows longer, the pragmatic general intelligence of AIXI would approach the theoretical\nmaximum; as AIXI would implicitly infer the relevant distributions via experience. However,\nif significant reward discounting is involved, so that near-term rewards are weighted much\nhigher than long-term rewards, then AIXI might compare very unfavorably in pragmatic general\nintelligence, to other agents designed with prior knowledge of v, y and 7 in mind.\n\nThe most interesting case to consider is where v and ¥ are taken to embody some particular\nbias in a real-world space of environments and goals, and this bias is appropriately reflected\nin the internal structure of an intelligent agent. Note that an agent needs not lack universal\nintelligence in order to possess pragmatic general intelligence with respect to some non-universal\ndistribution over goals and environments. However, in general, given limited resources, there\nmay be a tradeoff between universal intelligence and pragmatic intelligence. Which leads to the\nnext point: how to encompass resource limitations into the definition.\n\nOne might argue that the definition of Pragmatic General Intelligence is already encompassed\nby Legg and Hutter’s definition because one may bias the distribution of environments within\nthe latter by considering different Turing machines underlying the Kolmogorov complexity.\nHowever this is not a general equivalence because the Solomonoff-Levin measure intrinsically\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013054\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}
