Now, I was about to become the first\nof his successors to have been chosen from within the unit itself. As I called\ntogether the officers that first morning, I couldn’t be sure whether I would make\na success of my two years in command. But I did know what I hoped that I, and\nwe, would accomplish: to complete Avraham’s vision. To forge a true special-\nforces unit, at a time when the threats facing Israel seemed increasingly to\ndemand one.\n\nAvraham’s initial hopes and expectations for the unit had been more than\nmet. Sayeret Matkal had played the key role in erasing the traumas of Uri Ilan\nand Rotem, and restoring the morale and effectiveness of Israeli military\nintelligence. Time and again, operations which we said we could do — dismissed\nas too dangerous, or impossible, by others — proved achievable. Yet as I now\ntold the team leaders and our other officers, this was no longer enough.\n\nOur intelligence operations still mattered. In fact, we would have to “push\nfurther” across Arab borders, deeper into enemy communications systems. Our\nintercepts had given Israel an important edge in the Six-Day War. I assumed —\nthough naively, it would turn out — that they would be put to use in any future\nwar. But if the sayeret was to retain its unique role, we had to become a fighting\nforce as well. One reason, I didn’t even have to mention: we all remembered our\nfrustration in 1967, when we’d been little more than bit players in the most\nimportant conflict since the establishment of the state. But for me, the main\nargument for change was what had happened since the 1967 war: the fact that\nIsrael was facing a new range of security challenges which other army units,\ntrained to engage and defeat enemy troops on the battlefield, were not equipped\nto meet.\n\nIn the War of Attrition, we might not have lost a single inch of territory. But\nwe had lost tanks and planes. Israeli soldiers and pilots were being held prisoner\nin Egypt and Syria. Arafat’s Fatah and the other armed Palestinian groups might\nnot present a conventional threat. Yet while I’d been with my tank company in\nthe Sinai, they were fighting a full-scale civil war against King Hussein’s army\nin Jordan. The catalyst: a multiple hijacking in September 1970, a sign that they\nwere turning to non-conventional warfare, and to acts of terror.\n\n111\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011582\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I think something much more\namusing, in a sense, will happen first. The AI will know what you intend, and it will be\ngood at figuring out how to get there. I tell my car’s GPS I want to go to a particular\ndestination. I don’t know where the heck I am, I just follow my GPS. My children like\nto remind me that once when I had a very early GPS—the kind that told you, “Turn this\nway, turn that way”—we ended up on one of the piers going out into Boston Harbor.\n\nMore to the point is that there will be an AI that knows your history, and knows\nthat when you’re ordering dinner online you'll probably want such-and-such, or when\nyou email this person, you should talk to them about such-and-such. More and more, the\nAls will suggest to us what we should do, and I suspect most of the time people will just\ngo along with that. It’s good advice—better than what you would have figured out for\nyourself,\n\nAs far as the takeover scenario is concerned, you can do terrible things with\ntechnology and you can do good things with technology. Some people will try to do\nterrible things with technology, and some people will try to do good things with\ntechnology. One of the things I like about today’s technology is the equalization it has\nproduced. I used to be proud that I had a better computer than anybody I knew; now we\nall have the same kind of computers. We have the same smartphones, and pretty much\nthe same technology can be used by a decent fraction of the planet’s 7 billion people. It’s\nnot the case that the king’s technology is different from everybody else’s. That’s an\nimportant advance.\n\nThe great frontier five hundred years ago was literacy. Today, it’s doing\nprogramming of some kind. Today’s programming will be obsolete in a not very long\ntime. For example, people no longer learn assembly language, because computers are\nbetter at writing assembly language than humans are, and only a small set of people need\nto know the details of how language gets compiled into assembly language. A lot of\nwhat’s being done by armies of programmers today is similarly mundane. There’s no\ngood reason for humans to be writing Java code or JavaScript code. We want to\nautomate the programming process so that what’s important goes from what the human\nwants done to getting the machine, as automatically as possible, to doit. This will\nincrease that equalization, which is something I’m interested in. In the past, if you\nwanted to write a serious piece of code, or program for something important and real, it\nwas a lot of work. You had to know quite a bit about software engineering, you had to\ninvest months of time in it, you had to hire programmers who knew this or you had to\nlearn it yourself. It was a big investment.\n\nThat’s not true anymore. A one-line piece of code already does something\ninteresting and useful. It allows a vast range of people who couldn’t make computers do\nthings for them, make computers do things for them. Something Id like to see is a lot of\nkids around the world learn the new capabilities of knowledge-based programming and\nthen produce code that’s effectively as sophisticated as what anybody in the top ranks can\nproduce. This is within reach. We’re at the point where anybody can learn to do\nknowledge-based programming, and, more important, learn to think computationally.\nThe actual mechanics of programming are easy now. What’s difficult is imagining things\nin a computational way.\n\n188\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016408\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Coming face-to-face with one of the hijackers, he shot\nhim in the head. That allowed Mordechai to get back inside. He quickly\nexchanged fire with the hobbled Captain Rifa’at, hitting the hijacker in the side.\nAs Mordechai ducked down to reload his pistol, Rifa’at managed to lock\nhimself inside one of the toilets near the cockpit. Mordechai ran after him. He\nfired through the bathroom door, then kicked it open and confirmed that he was\ndead. Rushing back toward the center of plane, he spotted the main woman\nhijacker, wearing a bulky explosive vest. Grabbing her hands, he reached inside\nthe vest and yanked out the battery pack. With two of the hijackers already\ndead, Mordechai had now subdued the third. But knowing that there was still\nanother woman unaccounted for, he handed her over to Bibi and Marco\nAshkenazi.

These come from abstracting ethics beyond direct experience and\nmanipulating them abstractly and formally — a stage which has the potential for more deeply\nand broadly ethical behavior, but also for more complicated ethical perversions (it is the mature\ncapability for formal ethical reasoning that is able to produce ungrounded abstractions such\nas “I’m torturing you for your own good”). Developmentally, we suggest that once the capabil-\nity for formal reasoning matures, the categorical imperative and the quest for logical ethical\ncoherence naturally emerge, and the sophisticated combination of inferential and simulative\ncognition embodied in an appropriate social context then result in the emergence of the various\ncharacteristics typifying the mature ethical stage.\n\nFinally, it seems that one key aspect of the passage from the mature to the enlightened stage\nof ethics is the penetration of these two final imperatives more and more deeply into the judging\nmind itself. The reflexive stage of cognitive development is in part about seeking a deep logical\ncoherence between the aspects of one’s own mind, and making reasoned modifications to one’s\nmind so as to improve the level of coherence. And, much of the process of mental discipline and\npurification that comes with the passage to enlightened ethics has to do with the application\nof the categorical imperative to one’s own thoughts and feelings — i.e. making a true inner\nsystematic effort to think and feel only those things one judges are actually generally good\nand right to be thinking and feeling. Applying these principles internally appears critical for\neffectively applying them externally, for reasons that are doubtlessly bound up with the inter-\npenetration of internal and external reality within the thinking mind, and for the “distributed\ncognition” phenomenon wherein individual mind is itself an approximative abstraction to the\nreality in which each individual’s mind is pragmatically extended across their social group and\ntheir environment [Hut95].\n\nObviously, these are complex issues and we’re not posing the exploratory discussion given\nhere as conclusive in any sense. But what seems generally clear from this line of thinking is\nthat the complex balance between the multiple factors involved in AGI ethics, shifts during a\nsystem’s development. If you did CEV, CAV or CBV among five year old humans, ten year\nold humans, or adult humans, you would get different results. Probably you'd also get different\nresults from senior citizens! The way the factors are balanced depends on the mind’s cognitive\nand emotional stage of development.\n\n12.5.2 The Need for Context-Sensitivity and Adaptiveness in\nDeploying Ethical Principles\n\nAs well as depending on developmental stage, there is also an obvious and dramatic context-\nsensitivity involved here — both in calculating the fulfillment of abstract ethical imperatives,\nand in balancing various imperatives against each other. As an example, consider the simple\nAsimovian maxim “T will not harm humans,” which may be seen to follow from the Golden Rule\nfor any agent that doesn’t itself want to be harmed, and that considers humans as valid agents\non the same ethical level as itself.

Please find below (and attached as a PDF file), \nsome background information for your reference. Thanks for agreeing to have this discussion. \nRegards, \nMike \nPalm Beach Post Editorial #1 \nHe was over 50. And they were girls \nBy Elisa Cramer \nHASH(Ox5fa474) \nFriday, August 04, 2006 \nIf the women whom Palm Beach police say a part-time town resident invited to his home \nand paid for sex acts were, in fact, women, the solicitation charge against Jeffrey Epstein \nmight feel more sufficient. But, according to police records, they weren't. He was over \n50. And they were girls. 14. 15.16.17-year-old girls. That should count for something - \nthe difference between prostitution and pedophilia. \nSo, it is baffling that Mr. Epstein, who was indicted last month by a grand jury on one \nfelony count of solicitation of prostitution, has not been charged, as Palm Beach police \nstrenuously urged, with unlawful sex acts with a minor and lewd and lascivious \nmolestation. \nConviction of crimes against minors would mean steeper penalties than the maximum \nfive-year prison term Mr. Epstein faces if convicted of the single count of felony \nsolicitation. It also would help carry a message of intolerance to perverts who prey on \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021764 \ngirls. \nProsecutors did not pursue charges against Mr. Epstein reflecting the age of the victims \nbecause they assumed a jury would view the girls not as victims but as promiscuous, \nuntrustworthy, willing participants. The presumption is offensive. \nMr. Epstein, a 53-year-old Manhattan money manager who has hired Harvard law \nprofessor Alan Dershowitz and defense attorney Jack Goldberger, has denied knowing \nhow old the girls were. But police interviews with five alleged victims and 17 witnesses \nunder oath, as well as phone messages, a high school transcript and other items that \npolice found from searching Mr. Epstein's trash and 7,234-square-foot waterfront home, \nprovide evidence that he knew the girls were teenagers. \nOne girl couldn't show up when Mr. Epstein wanted because she had soccer. Another \ntime, Mr. Epstein had to wait for his \"massage\" session because the girl he wanted was \nstill in class. \nWhy didn't State Attorney Bany Krischer let a jury decide whether to believe the \nteenagers - including a 16-year-old who went to Mr. Epstein's house to \"work\" in \nDecember 2004 after being asked whether she needed to make money for Christmas \ngifts? \nProsecutors gave greater weight to the details Mr. Dershowitz provided about the girls in \nan apparent effort to assail their character. Mr. Dershowitz pointed out to prosecutors that \nsome of the teenagers had talked on myspace.com about marijuana and alcohol use. \nThe 20-year-old Royal Palm Beach woman who told police she recruited girls for Mr. \nEpstein has a Web page on myspace.com that features one girl using the name \"Pimpin' \nMade EZ.\" \nAlthough no charges of witness tampering have been filed, the parents of at least one of \nthe teenage victims complained to police of being followed and intimidated by two men. \nPolice determined that their vehicles were registered to two private investigators. Mr. \nGoldberger denied knowing anything about it. \nPolice also note in their reports that the state attorneys office offered Mr. Epstein a plea \ndeal that would have placed him on probation for five years, allowing him ultimately to \nwalk away with no criminal record at all. \nI asked Mr. Krischer's spokesman, Mike Edmondson, why the case was referred to a \ngrand jury instead of Mr. Epstein being charged and facing a trial before a jury. And \nshouldn't the victims credibility be a factor to determine whether a crime's been \ncommitted, not whether a jury will convict? (After all, as Mr. Goldberger told The Palm \nBeach Post of Mr. Epstein, \"He's never denied girls came to the house.\") \nEspecially, I asked Mr. Edmondson to explain: Why shouldn't the public look at this case \nand think there are two kinds of justice - one for the wealthy and one for the rest of us? \nMr. Edmondson said he could not comment on the case because it is active, but on the \nlatter point, he offered, for the sake of \"philosophical debate\": \"Whether wealth buys a \ndifferent standard of justice across the country ... the answer to that would, of course, be \nyes.\" \nBut in this case, he said, \"regardless of the battery of attorneys, the outcome would be the \nsame. Every issue that was debated in public was debated in our office before this case \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021765 \nwent to the grand jury.\" \nIn this case, it is not the victims credibility but the state attorneys that deserves \nquestioning. \nPalm Beach Post Editorial #2 \nMassaging the system \nPalm Beach Post Editorial \nThursday, August 10, 2006 \nPalm Beach police say their 11-month investigation shows that 53-year-old part-time \ntown resident Jeffrey Epstein committed unlawful sex acts with and lewd and lascivious \nmolestation on five underage girls. Defense attorney Jack Goldberger claims that his \nclient, Jeffrey Epstein, had no idea that the untrained girls he hired for massages were \nminors. \nThe Palm Beach Count State Attorneys Office could have let a jury decide whom to \nbelieve. Instead, State Attorney Barry Krischer left the public to wonder whether the \nsystem tilted in favor of a wealthy, well-connected alleged perpetrator and against very \nyoung girls who are alleged victims of sex crimes. \nMr. Krischer took the unusual step of referring the case to a grand jury, which last month \nindicted Jeffrey Epstein on one felony count of solicitation of prostitution. That decision \ncame after Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz met with prosecutors to undermine \nthe credibility of the 14- to 17-yearold girls who charged that Mr. Epstein had paid them \n$200 to $300 to undress and massage him in his five-bedroom, 7 1/2 -bath home on the \nIntracoastal Waterway. \nThe girls, Mr. Dershowitz told prosecutors, had written on myspace.com about smoking \nmarijuana and drinking alcohol. But if the girls have a credibility problem, what about \nJeffrey Epstein? Mr. Goldberger, told The Post: \"Mr. Epstein absolutely insisted anybody \nwho came to his house be over the age of 18. How he verified that, I don't know.\" And \nprosecutors took him at his word? \nPolice collected evidence that refutes Jeffrey Epstein's defense. Police searched his home \nand garbage and found phone messages about the girls' school schedules and even a high \nschool transcript, suggesting that Mr. Epstein at least knew that the girls were teenagers. \nThe state attorneys office has responded to criticism from Palm Beach police and others \nby noting the higher standard prosecutors face for conviction than law-enforcement \nofficers do for arrest. But in this case, the state attorney bowed to the risk that a jury \nmight look at both Jeffrey Epstein and the girls, and point fingers at both sides. \nEven if the girls could be impugned as prostitutes, solicitation of a minor is a crime. \nFormer disc jockey and teacher Bruno Moore was charged with that Tuesday. \nInvestigators say the 34-year-old used the Internet - myspace.com - to recruit a 13-year \nold. \nPolice say Jeffrey Epstein used a 20-year-old woman who had a myspace.com  \naccount to recruit young girls. His actions were sleazy. It would have been good to ask a \njury just how criminal they were. \nPalm Beach Post Editorial #3 \nSpare us the outrage \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021766 \nWednesday, February 13, 2008 \nAn 11-month police investigation led to an indictment on one felony charge of \nsolicitation of prostitution. That was in July 2006, and part-time Palm Beacher \nJeffrey Epstein still has faced no repercussions for allegedly preying on underage \ngirls. \nSo maybe Mr. Epstein is satisfied that he's getting his moneys worth from his large \nlegal team, which includes Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz \n(remember O.J. Simpson?) and Kenneth Starr (remember Monica Lewinsky?). Jack \nGoldberger of West Palm Beach, who's also on the team, told Post columnist Jose \nLambiet in November: \"This case is absolutely going to end without a trial within \nthe next two months.\" \nHe was wrong, but Mr. Goldberger remains on Mr. Epstein's payroll, feigning \nmoral outrage at two lawsuits filed this year against the Manhattan money \nmanager. The lawsuits allege sexual exploitation of teenaged girls, one of \nthem as young as 14. Said Mr. Goldberger after the first lawsuit, seeking \nmore than $50 million, was filed on Jan. 24: \"We think this shows what this \ncase is all about: money.\" Yes, it is - Mr. Epstein's effort to buy his way out \nof prosecution. \nAccording to the lawyer of a 17-year-old whose parents are suing him, Mr. Epstein \nmasturbated in front of her (she was 14 at the time) and used a vibrator on her at his \nhome in February 2005. Another Epstein attorney, Lilly Ann Sanchez dismissed it: \n\"Jeffrey Epstein did not have sex with this woman.\" \nFor those girls who claim that he did, Mr. Epstein's lawyers maintain that he did not \nknow their ages, despite a police search of his home and garbage that found phone \nmessages about the girls school schedules and even a high school transcript. For all of \nhis money, Mr. Epstein's best defense remains \"I didn't know that I was a criminal \npervert\"? \nPalm Beach Post Editorial #4 \nRich man fought the law and he mostly won \nPalm Beach Post Editorial \nMonday, July 07, 2008 \nTwo years after a grand jury indicted him on a felony charge of solicitation of \nprostitution, Jeffrey Epstein finally admitted that he lured a teenage girl to his $8.5 \nmillion, 13,000-square-foot Palm Beach mansion for sex. A week ago, the 55-yearold \ninvestment banker began serving 18 months in jail. \nBut that plea deal - guilty of felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring a \nperson under the age of 18 for prostitution - does not account for all five of the girls, \none as young as 14, who alleged that Epstein sexually abused them. And why is Epstein \nserving his term in the overcrowded Palm Beach County Jail and not a state prison, where \ninmates are sent if their sentences are longer than one year? \nThe slow, dissatisfying resolution of the case sends a message to the public \nPost your that there's a different system of justice for the wealthy who hire highcomments \npowered lawyers. Epstein's legal team included West Palm Beach defense \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021767 \non this attorney Jack Goldberger, Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz, \nwho defended O.J. Simpson against murder charges, and Kenneth Starr, the \nprosecutor who pursued then-President Bill Clinton for lying about sex with \nyoung women. \nPalm Beach police spent 11 months investigating Epstein before State Attorney Barry \nKrischer sent the case to a grand jury, instead of charging Epstein so the man who once \nboasted of accepting only billionaire clients could face a trial. The police had taken a high \nschool transcript, class schedules and phone messages from Epstein's home that showed \nhe knew the girls were underage. Yet Mr. Krischer was more swayed by Epstein's \nlawyers, who attempted to impugn the girls character by showing they had chatted on \nmyspace.com about smoking marijuana and drinking. He should have let a jury decide \nwhether the victims - and Epstein - were credible. \nUltimately, one charge against Epstein finally reflected the age of one victim, and the \nplea agreement left Epstein labeled a sex offender. With that additional charge, if Epstein \nhad been convicted at a trial, he could have been sentenced to anything from probation to \n15 years in prison, Assistant State Attorney Lanna Belohlavek said, adding that the \nrecommended guideline sentence was 21 months. \nEpstein also won't have to certify to the court that he is receiving counseling, typically \nrequired of sex offenders, because he has a private psychiatrist. But without court \nsupervision, who will ensure Epstein is in fact being treated? \nThe plea deal also drops a federal investigation of Epstein. If a federal investigation was \nwarranted, how does dropping it before completion benefit the public? \nEpstein preyed on girls and denied it. For three years, his wealth and the influence of his \nlawyers bought him the protection the state attorney owed to the victims. \nNew York Post — 07/27/2008 \nNew York Post - New York, N.Y. \nDate: Jul 27, 2006 \nStart Page: 014 \nSection: Page Six \nText Word Count: 395 \nIT looks like New York billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein got off easy when he was hit \nwith a charge of soliciting a prostitute for a \"happy ending\" in Palm Beach. \nBecause if Palm Beach police had their way, Epstein, 53 - who surrendered last Sunday \nand is out on $3,000 bail - might have been whacked with far more serious charges of \npaying underage girls for sex. \nBut a state grand jury found the witnesses in the case were not credible and threw out all \nbut the single charge of soliciting a hooker in his luxurious Palm Beach home. Epstein's \nlawyers and friends now say he's the hapless victim of a vendetta by Palm Beach Police \nChief Michael Reiter, whom they describe as a \"born-again nut case.\" \nAccording to the police investigation, a copy of which was obtained by the Palm Beach \nPost, detectives took statements from 17 witnesses and five alleged victims. Haley \nRobson, 20, a Palm Beach Community College student who described herself as \"like a \nHeidi Fleiss,\" says she got naked to give Epstein a massage, then brought him six girls \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021768 \nages 14-16 for massages and sex at his home. She said they were paid $200 per session. \nCops also allege that Epstein's personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, who hasn't been charged, \nset up the liaisons and put fresh sheets on the massage table and supplied massage oils. \nPolice searched through Epstein's garbage and retrieved sex toys and feminine hygiene \nproducts. \nEpstein's Palm Beach lawyer, Jack Goldberger, told Page Six that the Florida state \nattorney concluded the cops had looked at evidence from a \"one-sided perspective.\" He \nadded that Epstein had passed an extensive lie-detector test in which he was grilled about \nunderage girls. \nEpstein's New York lawyer, Gerald Lefcourt, said, \"The prosecutor didn't want to bring \nany charges in this case, but because of the craziness of this police chief, we have the \ncharge of solicitation.\" \nLast night, WPTV in Palm Beach reported that one reason Robson's testimony may have \nbeen dismissed is the kinky Web page she has on MySpace featuring photos of her \nfemale friends playing with sex toys. One friend even uses the name \"Pimpin Made EZ.\" \nRobson, who isn't charged, also writes, \"Do what you do to make that money, life is \na gamble. Stay hustling.\" \nA spokeswoman for Reiter said, \"We think our investigation speaks for itself\" \nCops also allege that [Jeffrey Epstein]'s personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, who hasn't been \ncharged, set up the liaisons and put fresh sheets on the massage table and supplied \nmassage oils. Police searched through Epstein's garbage and retrieved sex toys and \nfeminine hygiene products. \nEpstein's Palm Beach lawyer, Jack Goldberger, told Page Six that the Florida state \nattorney concluded the cops had looked at evidence from a \"one-sided perspective.\" He \nadded that Epstein had passed an extensive lie-detector test in which he was grilled about \nunderage girls. \nNewYork Post — 09/20/2007 \nJAIL LOOMS FOR SEX-CASE MOGUL \nSeptember 20, 2007 -- THE sordid sex case involving Jeffrey Epstein may \nbe coming to an unhappy ending -with a plea deal that would put the \npublicity-shy billionaire behind bars for 15 months for allegedly soliciting \nunderage teen girls for sex at his Palm Beach mansion. \nSources tell Page Six that Epstein's high-powered lawyers - including Alan \nDershowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black and Kenneth Starr - have been \nnegotiating a deal with federal prosecutors who are probing, among other \nthings, whether the gray-haired money manager paid West Palm Beach girls \nfor sex or transported them across state lines. Epstein is currently charged by \nthe State of Florida with soliciting young prostitutes for sex - but federal \ncharges would be far more serious. \nThe Palm Beach Post reported yesterday that Epstein is very close to a deal \nwith the feds that would send him to jail for 11/2 to 2 years. Sources tell us that \nwhile a deal has not yet solidified, what's under discussion is a guilty plea to \nat least one charge in exchange for a sentence of 15 months in a Florida state \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021769 \nprison, followed by 15 months of home confinement. That would be a fraction \nof the time he would have to serve if he were to be convicted by a jury. \nEpstein's spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, said his client would have no \ncomment. Dershowitz also declined to comment late yesterday. \nPalm Beach police records show that on March 15, 2005, a 14-year-old girl \nalleged she had visited Epstein's estate, where she partially stripped and \ngave him a massage during which he \"pulled out a purple vibrator\" and used it \non her in exchange for $300. A further probe uncovered five young women \nwho said Epstein had masturbated and touched their genitals during \nmassages, the records state. A woman named Haley Robson - who \ndescribed herself as \"like a Heidi Fleiss\" - later admitted bringing six girls \nbetween the ages of 14 and 16 to Epstein's house, according to cops. \nDespite the allegations, Epstein was only nailed on a single charge of \nsoliciting a hooker - but it sparked a federal probe. Epstein's lawyers and \nfriends have insisted he was the hapless victim of a vendetta by Palm Beach \nPolice Chief Michael Reiter, whom they described as a \"born-again nutcase.\" \nPalm Beach Post - 08/14/ 2006 \nPolice chiefs reputation helps discredit attacks \nBy Larry Keller \nPalm Beach Post - Monday, August 14, 2006 \nIn the case of Palm Beach financier Jeffrey Epstein, it seems, at times, as if two men are \naccused of wrongdoing: Epstein and Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter. \nEpstein, 53, was indicted last month on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution \nsolely because of Reiter's \"craziness,\" one of Epstein's lawyers said. His department \ndisseminated \"a distorted view of the case\" and behaved in a \"childish\" manner when the \ngrand jury didn't indict Epstein on the charges it sought, another Epstein lawyer \ncomplained. \nTo hear the Epstein camp tell it, Reiter, 48, is a loose cannon better suited to be the \nsheriff of Mayberry. They whisper that he's embroiled in a messy divorce. \nReiter did in fact file for divorce from his wife, (NAME REMOVED), last year, after 24 \nyears of marriage. They have a son, 18, and a daughter, 14. The couple is scheduled to go \nto mediation next week, Aug. 16. Nothing in the court file suggests their split is \nparticularly ugly. \nReiter incurred the wrath of the Epstein camp as well as the state attorneys office for two \nreasons. First, he pressed for Epstein to be charged with the more serious crimes of \nsexual activity with minors. Second, he slammed State Attorney Barry Krischer in blunt \nlanguage seldom used by one law-enforcement official concerning another because of \nwhat he perceived as that office's mishandling of the case. \nIn a letter to Krischer written May 1, Reiter called his actions in the Epstein case \"highly \nunusual.\" He added, \"I must urge you to... consider if good and sufficient reason exists to \nrequire your disqualification from the prosecution of these cases.\" In short, Reiter told \nthe county's top prosecutor for the past 13 years that he ought to get off the case. \"It \nlooks like a departure from professionalism,\" Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021770 \nFernandez Rundle said of Reiter's letter. \nFollowing Epstein's indictment, Reiter referred the case to the FBI to determine whether \nthe super-rich, super-connected defendant had violated any federal laws. Reiter won't \ndiscuss the case or the broadsides aimed at him. But others almost uniformly use one \nword to describe the chief: professional. \n\"I have always been impressed by Mike's professionalism and his leadership,\" said Rick \nLincoln, chief of the Lantana Police Department and a Palm Beach County cop for 32 \nyears. \"The town of Palm Beach has a very professional police department. We all \nconsider Mike to be our peer and a man of integrity.\" Juno Beach Police Chief H.C. \nClark II agreed. Although he doesn't know Reiter well, he has met with him on \ncountywide law enforcement issues. \"I've never seen him lose his cool. I've never seen \nanything but a professional demeanor from him.\" \nReiter joined the Palm Beach Police Department in 1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year patrol \njob at the University of Pittsburgh. His personnel jacket shows consistently excellent job \nevaluations. Posh Palm Beach is no hotbed of crime, and in his first year on the job, a \nresident confined to his home with a sick child thanked Reiter for delivering a few Cokes \nto the house. Reiter refused payment for the beverages. Another resident thanked Reiter \nfor shutting off his car's headlights in his driveway, saying a valet must have been at \nfault. Reiter worked everything from road patrol to organized crime, vice and narcotics. \nAnd he's no novice at investigations involving the island's rich and famous. He was the \nlead detective probing the drug overdose death of David Kennedy in 1984. He also was \none of the officers who worked the investigation of William Kennedy Smith, who was \ncharged in 1991 — and later acquitted — with raping a woman at the Kennedy family \ncompound in Palm Beach. \nReiter, who has a master's degree in human resource development from Palm Beach \nAtlantic University, also has attended the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Va., and \nmanagement courses at Harvard. He's been active in countywide interagency law \nenforcement organizations and has a \"top secret\" national security clearance. \n\"He has a perspective that's broader than just addressing the needs of the town,\" said \nTown Manager Peter \nElwell, who promoted Reiter from assistant chief to chief in March 2001. Reiter makes \nmore than $144,000 as the town's top cop. Elwell thinks he's worth it. He's very \nbusinesslike, very straightforward. He's not easily agitated or flamboyant. He's about the \nwork,\" Elwell said. \"I think that his service as chief has been outstanding in five-plus \nyears.\" \nNew York Times — 09/03/2006 \nQuestions of Preferential Treatment Are Raised in Sex Case Against Money Manager - \nSeptember 3, 2006 \nBy ABBY GOODNOUGH \nPALM BEACH, Fla. — In the summer and autumn of last year, when most of the \nmansions here stood empty behind their towering hedges, the police stealthily watched \none at the end of a waterside lane. They monitored the comings and goings of its owner's \nprivate jet, subpoenaed his phone records and riffled through his trash. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021771 \nThe owner was Jeffrey Epstein, 53, an intensely private New York money manager with \nseveral billionaire clients. Months earlier, the stepmother of a 14-year-old girl told the \nPalm Beach police that a wealthy older man, whom the girl later identified as Mr. \nEpstein, might have had inappropriate sexual contact with her. \nIn sworn statements to the police, the 14-year-old and other teenage girls said a friend \nhad arranged for them to visit Mr. Epstein's home and give him massages, usually in \ntheir underwear, in exchange for cash. \nMost of the girls, according to the police, said Mr. Epstein had masturbated during the \nmassages, and a few said he had penetrated them with his fingers or penis. They \nidentified him in photos and accurately described the inside of his home. Some recalled \nthat his employees had fed them snacks or rented them cars. \nMr. Epstein pleaded not guilty in August to the crime he was ultimately charged with, \nsoliciting prostitution. But at a time when prosecutors around the nation have become \nincreasingly severe in dealing with people accused of sex offenses, the case has raised \nquestions about whether Mr. Epstein's prominence won him preferential treatment. \nBy the account of the police, they found probable cause to charge Mr. Epstein with much \nmore serious offenses: one count of lewd and lascivious molestation and four counts of \nunlawful sexual activity with a minor. \nBut instead of proceeding with such charges on his own, the Palm Beach County state \nattorney took the rare step of presenting a broad range of possible charges to a grand jury, \nwhich indicted Mr. Epstein in July on the lesser count. In Florida, prosecutors usually \nrefer only capital cases to grand juries. \nEven before the indictment, the Palm Beach police chief, Michael Reiter, had accused \nprosecutors of giving Mr. Epstein special treatment and asked the state attorney, Bany E. \nKrischer, to remove himself from the case. \nIn an editorial, The Palm Beach Post attacked Mr. Krischer, a Democrat whose post is \nelective, saying the public had been left \"to wonder whether the system tilted in favor of \na wealthy, well-connected alleged perpetrator and against very young girls who are \nalleged victims of sex crimes.\" \nThe case has taken a toll on the reputation of Mr. Epstein, who owns a palatial home in \nManhattan, has pledged $30 million to Harvard and once flew former President Bill \nClinton on his 727. Politicians including Eliot Spitzer, a Democratic candidate for \ngovernor in New York, and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, also a Democrat, have \nreturned campaign contributions from him. \nBut Mr. Epstein fought back, assembling a team of star lawyers, including Gerald B. \nLefcourt and Alan M. Dershowitz, a friend of his, to look into the backgrounds of his \nyoung accusers. \nMr. Lefcourt says that the police acted \"outrageously\" and that his client has been \nwrongfully dragged through the mud. \n\"He disputes that he ever had sex with any under-age person or anything like that,\" said \nMr. Lefcourt, whose clients have included Russell Crowe, Martha Stewart and Abbie \nHoffman. \nNeither the police nor the state attorney's office would discuss the case in detail. But the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021772 \npolice released a thick report on the 13-month investigation after the indictment was \nunsealed in late July. \nThe police started investigating Mr. Epstein in March 2005, almost immediately after \nthey were contacted by the stepmother of the 14-year-old, who, according to the report, \nwas in a special school for students with disciplinary problems. \nThe girl, the report said, told the police that an older friend had \"offered her an \nopportunity to make money\" and had driven her to Mr. Epstein's house one Sunday. The \nfriend, identified by the police as Haley Robson, a local community college student, told \nthe girl to say she was 18 if Mr. Epstein asked, the report said. \nThe girl told the police that Mr. Epstein's assistant had led her upstairs to a room with a \nmassage table and that Mr. Epstein had come in and told her to remove her clothes. She \nsaid Mr. Epstein had masturbated as she massaged him, had pressed a vibrator against her \nunderwear and had given her $300 afterward. \nIn October, the police interviewed Ms. Robson, then 19, who told them Mr. Epstein had \nroutinely paid her to bring teenage girls to his home. The police then interviewed a total \nof 5 alleged victims and 17 witnesses, many of whom told similar stories about what they \nhad observed or participated in at Mr. Epstein's home. According to the report, at least \none said Mr. Epstein had engaged in intercourse with her. \nMr. Lefcourt, his lawyer, said one girl who told the police of having had sex with Mr. \nEpstein as a minor had lied about both the sex and her age and had not shown up for \ngrand jury questioning. He also said Mr. Epstein had passed a lie-detector test clearing \nhim of any sexual involvement with under-age girls. \nA spokeswoman for the Palm Beach police said that early this year, the police went to \nMr. Krischer, the state attorney, intending to apply for warrants to arrest Mr. Epstein. \nInstead, she said, they were told that Mr. Krischer would convene a grand jury to \nexamine the evidence and decide what charges, if any, to bring. \nAround that time, the police report said, Mr. Dershowitz met with prosecutors to share \ninformation about the accusers, including statements they had posted on MySpace.com, \nthe social networking site, concerning use of drugs and alcohol. According to the report, \nMr. Krischer's office then decided to delay the grand jury session for several months. \nThe Palm Beach police grew frustrated, the report said, and on May 1 the department \nasked prosecutors to approve warrants to arrest Mr. Epstein. \nChief Reiter also wrote Mr. Krischer questioning \"the unusual course that your office's \nhandling of this matter has taken\" and suggesting that Mr. Krischer disqualify himself. \nChief Reiter refused several requests to be interviewed, and his spokeswoman would not \nsay explicitly why he had urged the prosecutor to step aside. \nMike Edmondson, a spokesman for Mr. Krischer, said the state attorney's office \nsometimes sent noncapital cases to grand juries when there were questions about witness \ncredibility. Mr. Krischer does not recommend a particular charge in such cases, Mr. \nEdmondson said, but gives the grand jury a list of possible charges. \nBruce J. Winick, a law professor at the University of Miami, said that while prosecutors \nin Florida rarely referred noncapital cases to grand juries, they sometimes did so with \nsensitive cases to be extra-cautious. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021773 \nMr. Lefcourt said the police were wrong to have released the report so soon, especially \nwithout correcting information that later proved wrong. He cited his assertion that one \naccuser had lied about her age, adding that she had also been arrested on drug charges \nand had been fired by her employer for stealing. \n\"What I'm trying to focus on,\" Mr. Lefcourt said, \"is, What's motivating the selective \nand misleading release of information to the public?\" \nCopyright 2006 The New York Times Company \nNew York Times — 06/30/08 \nFinancier Starts Sentence in Prostitution Case -NYTimes.com Page 1 of 4 ge 1 of 4 \nJuly 1, 2008 \nFinancier Starts Sentence in Prostitution Case \nBy LANDON THOMAS Jr. \nThe bad news arrived by phone last week on Little St. James Island, the palm-fringed \nXanadu in the Caribbean where Jeffrey E.

The article, by the liberal journalist\nNikil Saval, both accepted Bannon’s central populist political premise—*the competition\nbetween workers in developing and developed countries ... helped drive down wages and\njob security for workers in developed countries’—and elevated it to the epochal fight of\nour time. Davos was dead and Bannon was very much alive. “Economists who were once\nardent proponents of globalization have become some of its most prominent critics,” wrote\nSaval. “Erstwhile supporters now concede, at least in part, that it has produced inequality,\nunemployment and downward pressure on wages.

My brother and I were retained\nto prepare and argue the appeal and to file a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered\nevidence.\n\nWe began our investigation by focusing on the burking theory. Since the jury could have\nconvicted based on that theory alone, if we could undercut it, Murphy would have to be given a\nnew trial.“ We would turn the prosecution’s “multiple choice” offense into an appellate defense.\n\nOne important pillar of the burking theory was a “bruise” on Binion’s chest that had been\nphotographed. Since Dr. Baden hadn’t examined Binion’s body, he had to rely on the photograph\nalone. He concluded that the bruise—which appeared consistent with the shape and size of\nBinion’s shirt button—had been caused by Binion being burked. We had the photograph enlarged\nand enhanced by the most sophisticated technology. We then showed it to one of the world’s\nmost distinguished dermatologists who examined it, using every more sophisticated technology.\nHis conclusion dealt a powerful blow to the burking theory: the mark on Binion’s body was not a\nbruise he could have gotten from being burked; instead, the structure of the blood vessels in the\n“bruise” proved that it was a benign skin tumor he had for years before his death.\n\nAdditional field research further discredited both the burking and cocktail theories. We were now\nconfident that if Murphy were to receive a new trial, a jury would acquit her. The prosecution’s\n“multiple choice” theory had become a “no choice” near certainty.\n\nNow all we needed was an opportunity to obtain a new trial. Our best chance of securing a\nsecond trial was to win the appeal, and the best issue on appeal—the safest and neatest—was the\njudge’s decision to allow Binion’s lawyer to testify that Binion had told him the day before his\ndeath that if he were found dead, Murphy would be his killer. This was a smoking gun that must\nhave influenced the jury, since it was, in effect, testimony from the grave. The ghost of the dead\nman, as in Shakespeare’s Hamlet, was pointing to his killer.\n\nWe did not believe that the conversation had ever occurred. Murphy told us that the lawyer, who\nhated her, had simply made it up after the fact to assure her conviction. But the jury had believed\nthe lawyer, and we could not challenge his credibility on appeal, since credibility issues—who is\ntelling the truth and who is lying—are for the jury to decide. But we could try to raise doubts\nabout the credibility of the dead man—the man whose words were quoted by the lawyer. How\ncould the jurors assess Binion’s credibility, since he was not in court to be cross-examined. His\n“testimony” from the grave was classic hearsay, and his unavailability denied Murphy the\nconstitutional right to confront her accuser.\n\n°° The same was true with regard to the “cocktail of death” theory, since no one could know which theory formed\nthe basis for the conviction, or if some jurors found the first, while others found the second. If either theory failed,\nthere would have to be a new trial.\n\n189\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017276\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Mike Pompeo had recently been named secretary of state,\nJohn Bolton would soon become the national security advisor, and Larry\nKudlow had been appointed director of the National Economic Council.\nThe president's chief political aides were Corey Lewandowski and David\nBossie, both Bannon allies, if not acolytes; both operated outside the\nWhite House and were frequent visitors at the Embassy. Many of the daily\nstream of White House defenders on cable television—the surrogates—\nwere Bannon people carrying Bannon’s message as well as the president's.\nWhat's more, his enemies in the White House were moving out, includ-\ning Hope Hicks, H. R. McMaster, the former national security advisor,\nand the ever shrinking circle of allies supporting the president's son-in-\nlaw and daughter.\n\nBannon was often on the road.

Early in the year, Bannon went to Cambridge\nto see Larry Summers, who had been Bill Clinton's Treasury secretary,\nBarack Obama's director of the National Economic Council, and, for a\ntime, president of Harvard. Summers's wife refused to allow Bannon into\ntheir home, so the meeting happened at Harvard instead. Summers was\nmis-shaven and wearing a shirt that was missing a button or two, while\nBannon was sporting his double-shirt getup, cargo pants, and a hunting\njacket. “Both of them looked like Asperger guys,” said one of the people\nat the meeting.\n\n“Do you fucking realize what your fucking friend is doing?” yelled\nSummers about Trump and his administration. “You're fucking the\ncountry!”\n\n“You elite Democrats—you only care about the margins, people who\nare rich or people who are poor” returned Bannon.\n\n“Your trade mumbo jumbo will sink the world into a depression,\nthundered Summers.\n\n“And you've exported U.S. jobs to China!” declared a delighted Ban-\n\nel\n\nSIEGE 23\n\nnon, always enjoying the opportunity to joust with a member of the\nestablishment.\n\nBannon was—or at least saw himself to be—a fixer, power broker\nand kingmaker without portfolio.

Or a wise man of the political fringe, if that was not an ultimate kinc\nof contradiction. Or the head of an auxiliary government. Or, perhaps\nsomething truly sui generis: no one quite like Bannon had ever playec\nsuch a central role in America’s national political life, or been such a thorr\nin the side of it.

They were right about that. If asked a question, especially one which\nobviously involved an issus of nuance, my instinct was not to come up with a\nsound bite. It was, as best I could, to answer fully and accurately. The difficulties\nthat could sometime cause hit home in an interview with a leading Israeli journalist\nin the spring of 1998. He asked how my life might have turned out if I’d been born\nand raised not as a kibbutznik, but a Palestinian. I answered: “At some stage, I\nwould have entered one of the terror organizations and fought from there, and later\nwould certainly have tried to influence from within the political system.” I did\nhasten to add that I abhorred terrorists, describing their actions as “abominable...\nvillainous.” But that was lost in the political storm that followed.

I assumed that instead of becoming an Israeli soldier and\npolitician, I would have become the closest thing to a Palestinian equivalent.

Briefly, in late 1977, I did pull ahead, during the\nperiod leading up to Bibi’s agreement to pull out of most of Hebron. But for much\nof 1998, I was running behind, and questions about my leadership surfaced\npublicly by the summer.

First, the new direction\nof US trade policy remains uncertain and could\nhave a sizable impact. For instance, a 15% tariff\nwould mechanically reduce China’s GDP by 0.9%.\nChina could respond by ramping up leverage,\nletting its currency depreciate faster and injecting\nmore fiscal stimulus, but that could risk further\nimbalances in the economy while also disrupting\nglobal financial markets. Second, striking the right\nbalance between stimulative and contractionary\nmeasures is a hazardous endeavor. On the road,\nas in government policy, accelerating and braking\nat the same time greatly increases the risk of\nan accident.\n\nIndia\nIndia’s streak of strong growth continues. The\neconomy expanded by an estimated 6.5% in\n2016, making it the fourth consecutive year of\nGDP growth in excess of 6.0%, a rare feat that\nIndia’s economy shares only with China’s. Growth\nwould likely have been even higher, were it not\nfor the “demonetization” scheme the government\nintroduced in November 2016. In a surprise\nmove, the government announced that large-\ndenomination bank notes, representing 86% of\ncash in circulation, would no longer be accepted\nas legal tender. The scheme—intended to root out\nillegal income stored in cash—had the unfortunate\nside effect of starving households of liquidity and\nthereby thwarting consumption, the main engine of\ngrowth. Although the severity of the consumption\nshock remains uncertain, it should be temporary.\nThe silver lining for 2017 is that India will\nprobably benefit from a meaningful recovery in\nhousehold spending. Moreover, fiscal policy will\nlikely be eased ahead of the 15 state elections\noccurring in 2017 and 2018, while investment\nshould receive a modest boost as the Reserve Bank\nof India lowers borrowing costs. Accordingly, we\nexpect GDP growth of 6.5-7.5% in 2017.\n\n46 | Goldman Sachs | JANUARY 2017\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014579\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He said that is what Jewish men spent their time\ndoing to avoid physical work while sitting near the city gates. It was the women who\nraised the crops and cared for the cattle and children.

If the latter is the case,\nhow would one chose which one.” In fact, there remains an on-going debate about\nthe order with which the embedded four passages from Exodus and Deuteronomy\nshould be arranged and inserted in the ftefillin such that some compromising\northodox Jews wear two types of fefi/lin, each representing one of the theoretically\njustified orderings. | know now that there is an implicitly positive confirmation of a\njointly held faith and feeling of ethnic belonging achieved by such apparently\nabstract discourse and argumentation.\n\nIn truth, | had not come to Warwick to explore the relationships between faith\nand rationality using the cognitive style of mathematicism, but rather to be saved by\nthe mathematical miracles of the Brain God.

I remember that when I was in my late teens, one boyfriend asked me if I'd be\nup for a certain kind of sex, and I refused. (He asked very gently, and didn't pressure me\nwhen I said no, which made me feel much safer and happier with him!) At the time I\ncouldn't imagine ever wanting to do it. Then a few years later -- after I'd gained a lot\nmore sexual experience -- I ended up asking my boyfriend to try it! I'm convinced that if\nmy previous partner had pressured me, I wouldn't have come around to it so easily years\nlater -- and if he and I had still been together, then maybe we would have even done it\ntogether.\n\n... But of course, the difficult part here is that sexual needs are important, and can't be put\non the back burner indefinitely. If you have sexual needs that are being routinely ignored\n-- or can't be fulfilled -- by your partner, then it's obviously not desirable to keep gently\nsaying, \"Don't worry, I can do without this.” Still, I think that if you're approaching\nultimatum territory -- for example, if you are tempted to say that \"If you can't satisfy this\nneed, then I need an open relationship so I can find someone who can, or else we have to\nbreak up\" -- then it's best to at least state the ultimatum gently, emphasize that you care\nabout your partner and this is difficult, and steel yourself to act quickly in case you have\nto go through with your ultimatum. And, of course, to understand that this could make\nsexuality with your partner more difficult if you keep trying to date through ultimatum\nterritory.\n\nSadly, sexual pressure can sometimes be simply unavoidable. Sometimes the best we\ncan do is be gentle, understanding, and prepared to face the consequences.\n\n2) Exposure to new conceptions of sexuality, sexual mentors, and sex education\n\nMany gay people say they're \"wired\" for a certain approach to sexuality, but there's also\nothers, such as some BDSMers, who consider ourselves to be innately kinky. And we\noften say that we would have come to those sexual conclusions and practices whether we\nhad examples before us, or not. (Even so, it's really helpful to have a community sharing\ntips and emotional support, especially when it comes to alternative sexuality. It might\nseem like sex will come naturally and obviously, but sometimes non-obvious things can\nreally trip you up!)\n\nStill, there are lots of sexual ideas are worth exploring and wouldn't necessarily occur to\nus if we didn't have examples before us: erotica, pornography, friends and mentors,\nworkshops and educational materials. Here's some concrete advice on how best to\nemotionally access those:\n\n* Find a good mentor, or at least a friend or social group, to talk about sex with --\nwho you don't want to have sex with. Being able to honestly discuss turn-ons in a\nneutral environment is invaluable, as is someone who can guide and advise without\ninserting their preferences and desires into the conversation. Naturally, it's entirely\npossible to have a good sexual relationship with a sexual mentor -- and sometimes,\nmentor (or friend) relationships evolve in unexpectedly sexual ways. But it can be very\nuseful to take that element out of at least some relationships.\n\nOne piece of advice that I love is for mentors to be the same \"type.\" That is, for example,\nif you're a heterosexual female submissive, it's awesome to have an experienced\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018524\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

What was constraining to cybernetics was the presumption of an\nanalogy of structure between the controller and the controlled. By the 1930s, Kurt Gédel,\nAlonzo Church, and Alan Turing had all described universal systems of computation, in\nwhich the computation required no structural analogy to functions that were computed.\nThese universal computers could also compute the functions of control.\n\nThe analogy of structure between the controller and the controlled was central to\nthe cybernetic perspective. Just as digital coding collapses the space of possible\nmessages into a simplified version that represents only the difference that makes a\ndifference, so the control system collapses the state space of a controlled system into a\nsimplified model that reflects only the goals of the controller. Ashby’s Law does not\nimply that every controller must model every state of the system but only those states that\nmatter for advancing the controller’s goals. Thus, in cybernetics, the goal of the\ncontroller becomes the perspective from which the world 1s viewed.\n\nNorbert Wiener adopted the perspective of the individual human relating to vast\norganizations and trying to “live effectively within that environment.” He took the\nperspective of the weak trying to influence the strong. Perhaps this is why he was able to\nnotice the emergent goals of the “machines of flesh and blood” and anticipate some of the\nhuman challenges posed by these new intelligences, hybrid machine intelligences with\ngoals of their own.\n\n126\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016346\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In a June\n2016 article about the US economy, Gregory\nMankiw, professor at Harvard University and\nformer chair of the Council of Economic Advisers\nfor President George W.

We have\nderived an approximate historical measure of\nfiscal policy changes by estimating changes in the\ncyclically adjusted federal budget as a percentage\nof GDP. We note that, by this measure, as far back\nas 1890, fiscal policy has been expansionary in all\nbut three recoveries following a recession—with\nthe fiscal policy in the current recovery being the\nmost contractionary, as shown in Exhibit 16. In\nthis recovery, the budget deficit as a share of GDP\nwas reduced by 1.0% a year, compared to an\naverage widening of the budget deficit by 1.3% a\nyear in all other recoveries after severe recessions.\nThe average increase in the size of the budget\n\nTwo books published in 2016 and written by Swedes born in the early\n1970s highlight the conflicting perspectives on productivity.\n\nJohan Norberg’s Progress cover used with permission of Johan Norberg\nand Oneworld Publications.

And we really do mean; however large. Even an\ninfinitely large formal system would be incomplete.\n\nThe only way to avoid this problem is with some sort of conspiracy\ntheory where we only come across problems our formal system can\nalready solve. Such a theory is a determined Universe. In a determined\nUniverse, all the mathematical problems we ever solve must be expressed\nby the formal systems existing in the Universe. We must never encounter\na problem where we need to extend the system and break the Gédel limit\nbecause we are pre-determined not to do so.\n\nThe Inconsistency Defense\nAn argument put forward by opponents of the Lucas-Penrose position\nis that humans are inconsistent formal systems. Inconsistent formal\nsystems are not subject to the incompleteness limit. Humans certainly\nbehave inconsistently with remarkable regularity but simply making\ninconsistent statements is not sufficient to show the underlying formal\nsystem is, itself, inconsistent. Inconsistent beliefs can come simply from\nmaking mistakes or reading the same story in two different newspapers!\nWe need a fundamentally inconsistent thinking mechanism inside our\nbrains to break the constraint. The very machinery itself would have\nto be inconsistent. But this is exactly Penrose’s point. Constructing a\nmachine capable of reasoning in an inconsistent but useful manner would\nneed exotic technology, some sort of non-deterministic, rationalizing\ncomputer. The components to make it could not be computer logic as we\nknow it today. All such logic is entirely computationally deterministic.\n\nLet me see if I can reframe the Lucas argument. Imagine IBM’s\nWatson computer was let loose on mathematical reasoning. Watson could\nscan every mathematical theorem ever written down. It would know\nevery programming language created. It would have its enormous bank\nof general knowledge to call upon and it could answer many questions.\nIt would sometimes appear inconsistent because the information it had\ntrawled from the Internet would be wrong. But Watson would still be a\nconsistent formal system and Gédel’s theorem says there would be truths\nWatson could never see. Lucas argues humans can see such truths where\na machine cannot, and these truths would allow a human to discover a\nproof to a mathematical problem that would forever elude Watson.\n\nThe Lucas argument runs into a brick wall because it asserts we see\ntruths a machine cannot. For each alleged creative step, his opponents\nsimply assert your brain was already sufficiently powerful to perform\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015897\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Mr. Fried asked Mr.\nRandolph if he would explain the reason for this. Mr. Randolph said the argument\nhad been made that 10-45 should not apply because the dog has already been\ndeemed dangerous by the County and pursuant to the Town’s Code. Mr.\nRandolph said he believed the argument was going to be made in court on Tuesday\nthat it is not appropriate for the Town to move forward with regard to 10-45 (1)\nbecause that only applies to any incident that occurs after the dog has been\ndeclared dangerous. The argument has been made that Dr. Lynn has done\neverything he is required to do. Mr. Randolph said he hesitated to explain further\nif the matter was going to be deferred. Mr. Randolph said the position of Staff is\nthat item (i) stands on its own merits, that it is not connected to 10-45 (a) through\n(h). It is also the position of Staff that it is appropriate to bring a violation of (i) to\nthe Code Enforcement Board even though it does not specifically state that in 10-\n45 because Section 2-439, which is the citation fine schedule, sets forth all of the\nsections of the Code of Ordinances which can be brought before the Code\nEnforcement Board and 10-45 is listed. Code Enforcement has the right to bring a\nviolation directly to the Code Enforcement Board instead of issuing the fine set\nforth in the fine schedule. Mr. Randolph said the Board could move forward in\nconsidering 10-45 instead of deferring it to the next meeting.\n\nMr. Fried commented that based on the egregious nature of what they had been\n\npresented with, he believed the Board should do everything they could to put\npressure on Dr. Lynn to comply.

Nonetheless, the\ncompany’s global presence has continued to grow, and it is playing an important role in\nsetting standards for 5G wireless technology.'* In April 2018, the United States announced\nsanctions against ZTE for violating restrictions on sales to Iran and North Korea, barring\nAmerican companies from transacting with the company. This would have effectively put\nZTE out of business because of its dependence on American inputs, but shortly thereafter,\nand against the objections of many in Congress, the Trump administration agreed to a\nsettlement that would allow the firm to stay in business.\n\nThere are other instances of companies being used to advance objectives contrary to the\nUS interest. For example, front companies have been used to aid in the illegal export of\nsensitive technologies to China. In another instance, Newsweek in 2016 reported that\nthe United States was investigating the acquisition by the Chinese company Fosun of\n\na US insurer that has sold legal liability insurance to senior American intelligence\nofficials.”\n\nGrowing Access to the US Political System\n\nAlthough federal campaign contributions by foreign nationals or companies are illegal in\nUS federal elections, there are alternative avenues for foreign corporate interests to influence\nthe US political system, as the Australians have learned. These include lobbying, indirect\ncampaign contributions via US subsidiaries, and the hiring of former senior government\nofficials. All these approaches, while currently legal, are discussed below to demonstrate the\nfull spectrum of activities Chinese entities are involved with and to highlight where they\nmay raise questions of impropriety.\n\nLobbying The most direct and legal route to the American political system is lobbying.\nFor example, within one day of President Trump tweeting his openness to a settlement\nwith ZTE Corporation that would keep it from going out of business, the company signed\na contract with lobbying firm, Mercury Public Affairs. The lead on the ZTE account was\nBryan Lanza, a former Trump campaign official.”° Also in 2018, the former senior advisor\nto Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross was hired as chief of International Corporate\nAffairs for another Chinese firm, HNA. Both instances underscore the need for updated\nrevolving-door policies, particularly with respect to foreign corporations that are subject to\nsignificant state control.?!\n\nCorporations\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020565\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He observes that high-income households have a lower marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of\nincome than other households, and they're currently holding a bigger slice of the economic pie. Research by\neconomists Atif Mian, Kamalesh Rao, and Amir Sufi backed that up, finding the MPC for households with an average\nannual income of less than $35,000 to be three times larger than the MPC for households with average income over\n$200,000 (39). Mian and Sufi also found that, as home values increased between 2002 and 2006, low-income\nhouseholds very aggressively borrowed and spent (possibly borrowing on increased home equity)--while high-income\nhouseholds were less responsive. Unsurprisingly, when housing wealth declined, the cutback on spending for\n\nlow-income households was twice as large as that for rich households (40).\n\nMian and Sufi further used ZIP codes to locate areas with disproportionately large numbers of subprime borrowers\n(those with low incomes and credit ratings) and found that these ZIP codes experienced growth in borrowing between\n2002 and 2005 that was more than twice as high as in ZIP codes with wealthy \"prime\" borrowers (41). They also found\nthat ZIP codes with lower income growth received more mortgage loans during that time period, supporting the notion\nthat government policy targeting low-income groups increased lending to the less well-off. After 2006, the subprime\n\nZIP codes experienced an increase in default rates three times that of prime ZIP codes.\n\nRaghuram Rajan claims that, while high-income individuals saved, low-income individuals borrowed beyond their\nmeans in order to sustain their consumption, and that this overleveraging, as a result of increased inequality, was a\nsignificant cause of the financial crisis in 2008 (42). An IMF paper by Michael Kumhof and Romain Ranciere also\ndetails the mechanisms that may have linked income distribution and financial excess and have suggested that these\n\nsame factors were likely at play in both the Great Depression and Great Recession (43).\n\nUnfortunately, coming back from the Great Recession appears to be taking longer than many had hoped. With a\npostrecession annual growth rate of 2.2%, our recovery is not even half the historical average annual growth of 4.6%\nfor other recoveries going back to 1959. This is not a complete surprise, given that financial crises are often followed\nby prolonged recessions and a long bout of subpar growth--thanks in part to the deleveraging that comes as people try\n\nto repair their finances.\n\nIndeed, during the recession, the consumption-to-income ratio of the bottom 95% of earners fell sharply, as banks and\nother lenders imposed tighter borrowing constraints, according to a study by Barry Z. Cynamon and Stephen M.\nFazzari (44). Though the consumption-to-income ratio of the top 5% rose, this increase was not enough to offset\ninadequate demand coming from the bottom 95%. That makes sense. Between 2007 and 2010, the average U.S.\nhousehold lost 39.6%, or about 18 years' worth, of their net wealth in the three years when the recession started in\n2007 to the early recovery in 2010. The middle class lost over 40% of their wealth in just three years, while the top\n10% of income earners actually accumulated an additional 2% to their wealth (see chart 7). Corporations that have\nbeen reluctant to invest or to cut prices to gain market share because of distorted incentives to seek short-term stock\nmarket gains have also depressed demand, according to Andrew Smithers (45). These two factors go a long way to\n\nexplain why the recent recovery has been subpar in comparison with other postrecessionary periods.\n\nWWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT AUGUST 5, 2014 15\n\n1351366 | 302136118\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025777\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Examples of uncertainty representation schemes are fuzzy logic [Zad78], imprecise\nprobability theory [Goo86, FC86], Dempster-Shafer theory [Sha76, Kyb97], Bayesian probability\ntheory [IKyb97], NARS [Wan95], and the Atom representation used in CogPrime, briefly alluded\nto in Chapter 6 above and described in depth in later chapters.\n\nMany, but not all, approaches to uncertain inference involve only a limited, weak set of in-\nference rules (e.g. not dealing with complex quantified expressions). CogPrime’s PLN inference\nframework, like NARS and some other uncertain inference frameworks, contains uncertain in-\nference rules that apply to logical constructs of arbitrary complexity. Only a system capable of\ndealing with constructs of arbitrary (or at least very high) complexity will have any potential\nof leading to human-level, human-like intelligence.\n\nThe subtlest part of uncertain inference is inference control: the choice of which inferences\nto do, in what order. Inference control is the primary area in which human inference currently\nexceeds automated inference. Humans are not very efficient or accurate at carrying out inference\nrules, with or without uncertainty, but we are very good at determining which inferences to do\nand in what order, in any given context. The lack of effective, context-sensitive inference control\nheuristics is why the general ability of current automated theorem provers is considerably weaker\nthan that of a mediocre university mathematics major [Mac95].\n\nWe now review the Piagetan developmental stages from the perspective of AGI systems\nheavily based on uncertain inference.\n\n11.4.1 The Infantile Stage\n\nIn this initial stage, the mind is able to recognize patterns in and conduct inferences about\nthe world, but only using simplistic hard-wired (not experientially learned) inference control\nschema, along with pre-heuristic pattern mining of experiential data.\n\nIn the infantile stage an entity is able to recognize patterns in and conduct inferences about\nits sensory surround context (i.e., it’s “world”), but only using simplistic, hard-wired (not expe-\nrientially learned) inference control schemata. Preheuristic pattern-mining of experiential data\nis performed in order to build future heuristics about analysis of and interaction with the world.\n\ns tasks include:\n\n1. Exploratory behavior in which useful and useless / dangerous behavior is differentiated by\nboth trial and error observation, and by parental guidance.\n\n2. Development of “habits” — i.e. Repeating tasks which were successful once to determine if\nthey always / usually are so.\n\n3. Simple goal-oriented behavior such as “find out what cat hair tastes like” in which one must\nplan and take several sequentially dependent steps in order to achieve the goal.\n\nInference control is very simple during the infantile stage (Figure 11.4), as it is the stage\nduring which both the most basic knowledge of the world is acquired, and the most basic of\ncognition and inference control structures are developed as the building block upon which will\nbe built the next stages of both knowledge and inference control.\n\nAnother example of a cognitive task at the borderline between infantile and concrete cog-\nnition is learning object permanence, a problem discussed in the context of CogPrime’s prede-\ncessor \"Novamente Cognition Engine\" system in [GPSL03]. Another example is the learning of\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013111\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Needless to say, I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard to support and mentor \nstudents, colleagues, and members of the general public. I do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your \nreporting is to somehow argue that that Universities and other institutions are lax in dealing with well known \nindividuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the opposite. My high public profile opens me up to \nmore scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens me up to a host of outside complaints and \nallegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which the University has to respond to. The fact that I have \nremained a professor in all Universities with which I have been associated, in good standing, and also an officer \nor an invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the \nfact that they trust my behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and invited to their last 3 \nmeetings to speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally \nappreciated my talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your \nreport is to impugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of \nyour 'miscellaneous facts', as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than \nallegations and innuendo. I also try and judge the facts in context. The fact that Universities and other \norganizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is because they value my \ncontributions and my actions. \nYour specific allegations are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in \n2006 where we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be \nappropriate, and had respectful encounters afterwards. I cannot comment on item 3, which involves an \nanonymous 3rd party claim, because I know nothing about it, and it was not taken seriously enough to result in \nany university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because I decided I didn't want to go out to a \nbar with a group of attendees that I was harassing them? The second part is false. I don't do that. Re incident \n5: The 'female companion' in this case is my wife, who can attest to the fact that the claim is false, which is \nwhat I wrote in response to the blog in question, causing it to be taken down. \nIt is worthwhile responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail, \nRe item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came \nto me or wrote to me with questions. When she asked about advice for after graduation I DID tell her she was \ndifferent than the other students in her year. The rest of them were interested in going on to graduate school, \nbut she was interested in science communication so I told her that she might want to take a different path. Since \nshe was the only woman in her year, as I recall, I did ask her on one of these occasions if that made it difficult \nfor her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member I was interested, and also because as someone she had \nasked for career advice from I wanted to know if that made a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have \ngone back over emails from that period. I have numerous requests from her to go for coffee to talk, which I \nusually had to turn down because I was busy, including several occasions where she asked me to have coffee \nwith her off campus to talk, and I politely declined. I did let her accompany me off campus one time to watch \nme do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it. I did and do have coffee and meals with students \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031239 \non campus, and I see nothing wrong with this. I was shocked when I later learned of her complaint, not least \nbecause there was no inappropriate interaction and also because well after the date on which she is said to have \nbeen offended, she continued to email me with joking questions or comments, and at a AAAS conference in \n2008, for which she had asked, and for which I had written her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife \nand I gave her a lift well out out of our way to drop her off at her hotel, and I note in an email response to her \nemail about the conference, agin in 2008, I expressed that I would pass her regards along to my wife and vice \nversa. When the University informed me of the complaint I was shocked and concerned. When I spoke to \nthe human resources person, including relating my concerns and providing the emails in question, I was told \nthat no formal complaint of sexual harassment was deemed to be warranted in this case, and that the young \nwoman in question had agreed to that. By that time I learned of the complaint I had already announced my \nintentions to leave Case to accept an offer at ASU—a very difficult decision for me because of my long-\nstanding attachment to the University, and the excellent relations I had with my colleagues there, both among \nthe faculty and among the administration. Because I was already in Arizona at the time I was asked not to have \nany further interaction with the student I agreed to that request because it was basically moot. I was also told \nthat because it was being handled informally, that (a) it should remain confidential, which I, at least abided by, \nand (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would remove the allegation from \nmy record after 5 years, which makes me surprised that someone violated that written agreement with you. \nRe item 6: You report on ASU's response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically \nstated there were never any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and the \noutside complaints were in fact related specifically to your item #6. Further you neglect to mention that this \ncomplaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual who was allegedly harassed, who never lodged a \ncomplain, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged transgression. I was surprised and \ndismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by both Universities \nthat because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private events unrelated to \nthe University would be investigated. The complaint was investigated throughly by both ASU and ANU and \nboth came to the conclusion that it was not credible and no university policies had been violated. . In addition \nANU's investigation, which took a full month found significant inconsistencies in the allegation, suggesting \ndistortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU report. The initial complaint, which in fact resulted in a \ntemporary suspension by ANU outlined the claim you made in the words you quoted in your note to me, along \nwith the statement made in the complaint that \n\"It is the University's understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the \ntime of the incident.\" \nAfter the investigation, the final report absolved me of any wrongdoing, and indicated information inconsistent \nwith the original claim and apparent later claims as follows: \n\"The allegations were made by an observer to the incident. \n- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched \nin \nan unwelcome manner. \n- The conference attendee who took the `selfie' photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference \norganisers \nat the time of the incident (November 2016). \n- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference \norganisers \nat the time of the incident (November 2016). \nThe photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact. \n- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who \ntook \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031240 \nthe `selfie' photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was \nrequested \nin the course of the investigation.\" \n(And for the record I often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as I specifically request selfies \nnot to include flashes, so that I don't end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half hour) \nWhat makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that I get asked for literally thousands of selfies, \nand when people come up to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, and sometimes overly aggressive. I am \nparticularly proud of the way I attempt to make all people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated. \nThus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what I am about, which is to acknowledge fans in a way that makes \nthem feel appreciated. As I understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take selfies at the CFI \nconference in Las Vegas this year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed. Moreover, I am proud of the \ninteractions I have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff. I have had numerous female \ngraduate students, postdocs, employees, and colleagues, and as ASU attested to you, none of these have ever \ncomplained of harassment. Quite the contrary in fact, as I have worked hard to support them, mentor them, and \ntreat them with respect. I treat others as responsible adults, and I expect to be treated equally. \nLawrence M.

As we've already discussed by email, I'd very much like to interview you about these allegations in \ndetail. \nIn particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two universities had investigated an incident (# 6 \nbelow). You claimed that \"both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and \nfabricated with malicious intent.\" We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious \nintent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031241 \nThe story concerns your actions towards students while a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve \nUniversity, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement. I \nam reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, Azeen Ghorayshi and Virginia \nHughes. \nOur story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below). \nOur reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with — Case Western, \nArizona State University, the Australian National University, the New College of the Humanities, and the Center \nfor Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors — have handled complaints \nand concerns about your behavior during this time. \nOur story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and \neyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues, \nstudents, and peers in the skeptics movement. \nI wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you \nwish to comment on any of the below findings, we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We are \nplanning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, Eastern US Time. \nBased on our reporting, this is what we plan to publish: \nIncident 1: \n• In November of 2006, at an event launching the new Center for Inquiry in Washington D.C., you met a \nvolunteer for CFI D.C. \n• At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked \nher if she was \"of age.\" \n• Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner. \n• You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying. \n• You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work. \n• In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne, \ndespite her suggestion that you go down to dinner. \n• You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face. \n• You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and \ntrying to pull down the crotch of her tights. \n• She struggled to push you off her. \n• You said, \"When I was in college I could never get a girl that looked like you.\" \n• When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said \"I have to go,\" and rushed out of \nthe room. \nIncident 2: \n• In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve \nUniversity, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it \nmust be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates. \n• In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student \nvisited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored \nthe questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner. \n• Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without \nmentioning you by name. \"There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought \ndifferently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me \nupset for weeks afterward,\" she wrote. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031242 \n• She was then approached by a dean at the university, who suspected that she was referring to you, \nbased on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and \nshe did. \n• University investigators interviewed both you and the student. \n• On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university's associate vice president for student \naffairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told: \n\"This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university's sexual harassment \npolicy. \n• The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she \nremained at Case. \n11 \n• The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics \ndepartment before setting foot on the campus again. \n• The letter also stated, \"Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also \nhis willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with \nstudents.\" \n• By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the \nmonth before. \n• \"The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career,\" \nyou told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008. \nIncident 3: \n• A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous \nincident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her. \nIncident 4: \n• You met a student from another university, an atheist activist, in March 2008 at the American Atheists \nConvention in Minneapolis. She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she \nwas attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic. \n• During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student \nand volunteers for Dawkins' foundation. \n• Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink. \n• You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a \nmale friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go. \n• You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, Iowa, in April 2011. \n• \ntable. \nYou pulled over a chair for her in the bar, and then started running your hand up her leg under the \n• She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She \ncrossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away. \nIncident 5: \n• This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were \ninformed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your \nfemale companion for sex in your cabin. \n• At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged \nCFI's president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galapagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise, \nhowever. \nIncident 6: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031243 \n• During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once \nagain. \n• The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics  \nNational Convention, where you were a featured speaker. \n• With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie. \n• As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her \nright breast. \n• She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. \"Don't do that,\" she said. \n• BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College \nof the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your hand \nin motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses have \nconfirmed the complainant's account of what happened. \n• In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your \nreputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016 \nincident. \n• On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National \nUniversity in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting \nappointments. \n• Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But \nneither university found against you. \n• \"Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate \nthe allegations,\" Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her. \n• Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State's Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an \ninquiry \"did not find a violation of university policy.\" \n• In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints \nof sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university's senior associate general counsel, \nnoted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. \"The University did \nnot find either communication to state a credible allegation,\" Jewett wrote. \nMiscellaneous facts: \n• In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort \nto understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since. \n• Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent \nessays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made with \nbiologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America's leading public \nintellectuals. \n• You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and are a \nvocal critic of President Donald Trump. \n• You also make regular public appearances across the world, often at gatherings of skeptics and \natheists. \n• At CSICon in Las Vegas in October, a few dozen fans paid $500 per head to attend a VIP luncheon \nwith you and Dawkins. \n• Many more lined up to get you to sign their copy of your latest book, The Greatest Story Ever Told — \nSo Far. \n• Online, people can buy T-shirts emblazoned \"Lawrence Krauss for President.\" \n• In talks and interviews, you have argued that our universe arose without divine intervention, that \nreligion drives xenophobia, and that our brains are hardwired to believe. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031244 \n• You have stated that science provides answers to many of life's biggest questions, and can even fix \ngreat societal injustices. \n• Earlier this year, at a Q&A event to promote your new book, the conversation came around to the \ndearth of women and minorities in science. \"Science itself overcomes misogyny and prejudice and bias,\" you \nsaid. \"It's built in: Questioning yourself, always questioning results, questioning others, relying on empirical \nevidence.\" \n• You have clashed with some skeptics over your defense of Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire financier who in \n2008 was convicted for soliciting prostitution from underage girls, and spent 13 months in a Florida jail. \n• Through his private foundation, Epstein has funded the work of several prominent scientists. He has \nprovided funding for your Origins Project, supporting lectureship and scholarship programs, most recently \npledging $100,000 in 2014. \n• In April 2011, you told the Daily Beast: \"As a scientist I always judge things on empirical evidence and \nhe always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my \npresumption is that whatever the problems were I would believe him over other people.\" \n• In a blog comment about the Epstein controversy, you wrote: \"I remain skeptical, and I support a man \nwhose character I believe I know.. .If you want to condemn me for that, so be it.\" \n• You were made an honorary member of CFI's board of directors in December 2011. \n• A blog post published in August 2013 described incidents #1 and #4, naming you. Another post, \npublished at around the same time, described incident #5. \n• The first post was edited to remove your name after you had commented that the allegations of assault \nwere \"potentially illegal.\" The second post was quickly taken down. \nAgain, if you wish to comment on or clarify any of these points, please get in touch with us as soon as possible. \nIf I do not respond immediately it is because I am on another call, so please leave the best phone number to \nreach you. \nThanks, \nPeter Aldhous \nPeter Aldhous, PhD \nScience reporter I BuzzFeed News \ntel: \ncell: \n@paldhous  \nwww.peteraldhous.corn \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031245 \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

On November\n15, 2008 they still were not in compliance and a daily fine of $250.00 started\nrunning. The final inspection was obtained in March, 2008. The fine ran for 137\ndays prior to compliance being achieved and the accumulated fine due is\n$34,250.00 and the $150.00 hearing costs have not been paid.\n\nFrank Lynch advised he was the attorney for both The Landfall Group and Ajax.\n\nHe said when they appeared before the Board in October, Lazslo Wagner, the\nprincipal of The Landfall Group, who has built homes throughout the Town of\nPalm Beach for 26 years acknowledged he was unaware of this particular code\nprovision. Had he been, they would have applied for an extension of time to\ncomplete the construction. At the hearing, Mr. Koeppel made a motion to allow\nthem an additional sixty (60) days to complete the construction, find them in non-\ncompliance and assess the $150 costs. After a significant amount of discussion,\nthat motion went to a vote and failed 4-3. A second motion was made and Ms.\nDuemler thought the $250.00 fee was significant and believed the fine should be\n$125.00 a day. Mr. Lynch gave Mr. Walton a copy of that transcript to put in the\nrecord. As part of their request, they are asking the Board to consider what Ms.\nDuemler suggested at the meeting. At the same time, Mr. Lynch said he would like\nthem to consider that The Landfall Group is a good corporate citizen and made a\nlegitimate mistake. As a result, a fine was incurred and they are willing to accept\nsome level of fine, some level of responsibility for what they did. The construction\nwas continually on going, there were no delays other than the construction process\nitself. This was not someone’s house, it was a speculative venture. There had\nbeen some concerns with the shell contractor and the finish items themselves were\nsignificant enough that there were substantial delays. At that same hearing, Code\nEnforcement Officer Gerry said it was the position of Code Enforcement to get\nmore assertive at the suggestion of Town Council and that these projects were to\nbe more aggressively pursued. Under the new ordinance, for a house of\napproximately 5,000 sq. feet, they would be entitled to 24 months.

Several prominent American entertainers\nhave been subject to bans by China, most often for their association with the Dalai Lama.\nIn an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, actor Richard Gere, an outspoken advocate of\nTibetan culture, stated, “There are definitely movies that I can’t be in because the Chinese\nwill say, ‘Not with him,’”*?\n\nBeyond self-censorship, American studios and creative personnel are at risk of being actively\nco-opted in advancing Chinese soft power. Chinese political and entertainment leaders are\nconscious that American entertainment companies have played an outsize role in defining\nChina, from Mulan to Kung Fu Panda. By the time the third edition in the Panda franchise\nhad been released, however, it was being coproduced with a Chinese partner. The list of\nfilms portraying China in a positive light grow each year, such as the space films Gravity\nand The Martian, a movie backed by Chinese money in which the American protagonists\nare saved by the Chinese. Ironically, in Gravity, a central plot twist involves the shooting\ndown of a satellite by the Russians. In fact, the only nation to have shot down a satellite in\nreal life is China. These positive portrayals, of course, are not inherently objectionable—\nand they may, indeed, provide a constructive countervailing force in an otherwise\ndeteriorating relationship. The issue is: How do these portrayals come to be: In other\nwords, has independent artistic vision been manipulated by political pressures to\nmaintain commercial standing?\n\nThe rush of Chinese investment into the American film industry has raised legitimate\nconcerns about the industry’s outright loss of independence. In 2012, Dalian Wanda\nacquired the AMC cinema chain, followed in 2016 by the acquisition of the Legendary\nEntertainment studio. Before encountering political trouble at home, Wanda’s chairman\nannounced a desire to invest in each of the six major Hollywood studios. Since then, other\nannounced partnerships and investments have faded, principally because of Beijing’s\npushback against what it deemed to be grossly excessive, and often ill-considered, foreign\ninvestment plans by Chinese companies.**\n\nConclusion and Recommendations\n\nThrough control of its companies operating abroad, growing influence over foreign\ncompanies, and the rapid activation of business-related United Front groups, China is\nusing commercial interests as an important means of exercising “sharp power” influence.\nAs with other sectors, much of China’s activity is, regardless of its intent, legal and thus\nshould not be disparaged. The appropriate response to this commercial challenge must be\ntemperate and multifaceted. In some areas, it will require that the political system increase\nits transparency regarding or reduce its exposure to corporate money entirely, which, given\n\nCorporations\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020571\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In fact, an October 2016 paper by a\nteam at the Federal Reserve Board, “Understanding\nthe New Normal: The Role of Demographics,””°\nshows that the slow pace of economic growth since\n1980 and the more pronounced decline in the last\ndecade could be predicted by a model looking\n\nat “fertility, labor supply, life expectancy, family\ncomposition, and international migration.”\n\nThus, a glass half-full or half-empty perspective\ndoes not change the facts on the ground. There is\nlittle cause for near-term optimism with respect\nto the slower growth rate of the labor force. The\ngeneral consensus is that the US labor force will\ngrow at an average of 0.6% per year in the next\nseveral decades, compared with 1.6% from 1950\nto 2000.7!\n\nIn the shorter term, infrastructure investment\nand other policies highlighted above may boost\nthe growth rate in the labor force, but it is hard to\nimagine growth rates reaching levels that would\nsupport President-elect Trump’s GDP growth\ntargets of 3-4% ona sustainable basis.??\n\nSecular Stagnation: Declining\n\nProductivity Growth\n\nOf all the theories put forth to explain the slow\npace of this recovery, the one that has garnered the\nmost attention is declining productivity growth.\n\nOf all the theories put forth to explain\n\nthe slow pace of this recovery, the\none that has garnered the most\nattention is declining productivity\ngrowth.\n\nIt is also the most important issue in terms of its\nimpact on future trend growth in the US, which in\nturn has the greatest impact on the long-term rate\nof earnings growth and equity market returns.\n\nAs reviewed in last year’s Outlook, the techno-\noptimists and the techno-pessimists are on opposite\nsides of the debate on declining productivity\ngrowth. Both camps have garnered new members;\neven Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and\nVice Chair Stanley Fischer have joined the fray.”\nMost recently, in September 2016, the Brookings\nInstitution hosted a conference with leading\nexperts from both camps to debate the issue.\n\nWe should note that debates on productivity\nare nothing new. They have surfaced during past\nperiods of slow growth, as was the case in the early\n1990s. Even some of the players are the same:\nRobert Gordon was a techno-pessimist in the early\n1990s and remains so in the 2010s.4\n\nPart of the productivity debate is philosophical.\nFor example, one question pertains to the increased\nuse of free digital services such as Facebook,\nGoogle Maps, Waze and Khan Academy. These\nservices yield “consumer surplus,” defined as the\nbenefits consumers derive from various activities\nover and above the price they pay. Should they be\nincluded in GDP if they are deemed “non-market”\nservices—those that are provided free of charge\nor at a fee that is well below 50% of production\ncosts? While social media such as Facebook may\n(or may not, depending on your perspective)\nprovide a service greater than the advertisement\nrevenues associated with the use of that service,\nsome will argue that if such services do not have an\nassociated market price, they are not part of GDP\nand therefore should not impact the calculation of\nproductivity levels. As the volume and the impact\nof these non-market services increase, we believe\nthat the methodology for measuring GDP will\nevolve to better reflect the value of these services.\n\nSuch improvements in measuring GDP are not\nuncommon. The Bureau of Economic\nAnalysis (BEA) conducts comprehensive\nrevisions of the national income and\nproduct accounts every five years, with\nthe goal of reflecting methodological\nand statistical improvements. Most\nrecently, in 2013, the BEA expanded\nits definition of fixed investment to\ninclude expenditures on research and\ndevelopment and expenditures on artistic\noriginals (e.g., books, music, television\n\n12 | Goldman Sachs | JANUARY 2017\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014545\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But while it may not have shown, I felt a churn\nof emotions when I formally presented my government to the Knesset in July 1999\nas Nava, our three daughters, her parents and mine looked on proudly from the\ngallery. Even more so, when I entered the office of the Prime Minister. I’d been\nthere before: as head of military intelligence, chief of staff and a cabinet minister.\nYet to sit behind the vast wooden desk and know that the buck now truly stopped\nwith me — to become just the tenth person in Israel’s history to have that honor —\nwas very different.\n\nWhat I felt most powerfully, however, wasn’t the honor. It was the\nresponsibility. I knew that Israel faced two deepening crises. The first was\ndomestic. Though Yitzhak Rabin’s assassin was now in jail, the divisiveness and\nhatred of which he was a product and symbol had not gone away. Nor had other\nrifts: between the privileged and disadvantaged, Ashkenazim and Sephardim, and,\nperhaps most of all, secular and religious. The second, more immediate challenge\nwas on our borders. The peace process was stalled. If we were going to revive it,\nwe were running against the clock. President Clinton, a key player in any hope of\nturning the promise of Oslo into real peace, had only 18 months remaining in\noffice. In terms of Israel’s security, the timetable was even less forgiving. From my\nvery first intelligence briefings as Prime Minister, I was even more convinced of\nwhat I’d been warning Bibi for months: without a political breakthrough, a new,\nmuch more deadly intifada was only a matter of time.\n\nThat would have been reason enough to make peace efforts my first priority.\nBut even as I was addressing the victory rally in Rabin Square, I sensed that the\nsimple arithmetic of the election results would leave me no other choice. I was\nentering office with the largest electoral mandate in our history. But that was\nbecause of Israel’s new voting system, with separate ballots cast for Prime Minister\nand party. That system had had precisely the opposite effect on party voting. In\nprevious elections, most Israelis had chosen one of the two main parties, knowing\nthat only they had a realistic chance of forming a government.

So when our computers\ngenerate a result, we feel that we intellectually grasp it.\n\nThe new machine-learning programs are different. Having recognized patterns\nvia deep neural networks, they come up with conclusions, and we have no idea exactly\nhow. When they uncover relationships, we don’t understand it in the same way as if we\nhad deduced those relationships ourselves using an underlying theoretical framework. As\ndata sets become larger, we won’t be able to analyze them ourselves even with the help\nof computers; rather, we will rely entirely on computers to do the analysis for us. So if\nsomeone asks us how we know something, we will simply say it is because the machine\nanalyzed the data and produced the conclusion.\n\nOne day a computer may well come up with an entirely new result—e.g., a\nmathematical theorem whose proof, or even whose statement, no human can understand.\nThat is philosophically different from the way we have been doing science. Or at least\nthought we had; some might argue that we don’t know how our own brains reach\nconclusions either, and that these new methods are a way of mimicking learning by the\nhuman brain. Nevertheless, I find this potential loss of understanding disturbing.\n\nDespite the remarkable advances in computing, the hype about AGI—a general-\nintelligence machine that will think like a human and possibly develop consciousness—\nsmacks of science fiction to me, partly because we don’t understand the brain at that level\nof detail. Not only do we not understand what consciousness is, we don’t even\nunderstand a relatively simple problem like how we remember a phone number. In just\nthat one question, there are all sorts of things to consider. How do we know it is a\nnumber? How do we associate it with a person, a name, face, and other characteristics?\nEven such seemingly trivial questions involve everything from high-level cognition and\nmemory to how a cell stores information and how neurons interact.\n\nMoreover, that’s just one task among many that the brain does effortlessly.\nWhereas machines will no doubt do ever more amazing things, they’re unlikely to be a\nreplacement for human thought and human creativity and vision. Eric Schmidt, former\nchairman of Google’s parent company, said in a recent interview at the London Science\nMuseum that even designing a robot that would clear the table, wash the dishes, and put\nthem away was a huge challenge. The calculations involved in figuring out all the\nmovements the body has to make to throw a ball accurately or do slalom skiing are\nprodigious. The brain can do all these and also do mathematics and music, and invent\ngames like chess and Go, not just play them. We tend to underestimate the complexity\nand creativity of the human brain and how amazingly general it is.\n\nIf AI is to become more humanlike in its abilities, the machine-learning and\nneuroscience communities need to interact closely, something that is happening already.\nSome of today’s greatest exponents of machine learning—such as Geoffrey Hinton,\nZoubin Ghahramani, and Demis Hassabis—have backgrounds in cognitive neuroscience,\nand their success has been at least in part due to attempts to model brainlike behavior in\ntheir algorithms. At the same time, neurobiology has also flourished. All sorts of tools\nhave been developed to watch which neurons are firing and genetically manipulate them\nand see what’s happening in real time with inputs. Several countries have launched\nmoon-shot neuroscience initiatives to see if we can crack the workings of the brain.\nAdvances in AI and neuroscience seem to go hand in hand; each field can propel the\nother.\n\n132\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016352\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Yediot\nhad been planning the story for months. It had been ready to go with it earlier,\nwhen it was assumed I would be joining the government as early as April. The\neditors had held it to coincide with my arrival as a minister. That, I suppose,\nwas simply what newspapers did. But it turned out that at least two influential\nLabor politicians had played a part in steering Yediot toward the story, and\nurging the newspaper to run with it: Haim Ramon, a veteran party figure and\ncabinet minister, though he’d quit the government the year before over the\nparty’s failure to follow through on health-policy reform; and Shimon Shevess,\none of Rabin’s top advisers. Ramon would later say that they hadn’t wanted to\n“kill Barak” as a new minister. “Just fire some bullets at this legs, so he’ Il enter\npolitics with a limp.” It was a way of cutting me down to size.\n\nI suppose that was understandable. I was by no means the only former\ngeneral to enter Israeli politics. Other chiefs-of-staff had gone on to play\nprominent roles in government: Dayan, Motta Gur and, of course, Rabin. But\nthe fact that I was going directly into the cabinet, and so soon after leaving the\narmy, was seen by the Israeli media — and a number of Labor politicians — as a\nreflection of my close relationship with Rabin. Some commentators had even\nbeen speculating I might eventually be a candidate to succeed him as party\nleader and Prime Minister.\n\nIt was true that Rabin had personally urged me to join the government,\nstarting with a lighthearted remark only days after I’d ended my term as chief of\nstaff. It was at a farewell organized by my staff. The event began with film clips\nfrom my years in the army, and a series of entertaining cameos from men I’d\nserved with and led. Rabin spoke at the end. He said he’d recently been on an\nofficial visit to South Korea. He’d met the president, who told him he was the\nfirst Korean leader not to have been an army general. Rabin said he’d replied\nthat he was the first Israeli Prime Minister who was a general. Then, smiling\nand looking straight at me, he added: “Nu, Ehud?”\n\nI did want to join his government. But I had been in the army since the age\nof seventeen and was now in my early fifties. For my family’s sake, as well as\nmy own, I had figured on taking a year or two to explore other things. Two\noptions appealed to me especially. One was business. My brother-in-law, in\naddition to having a successful law practice, was involved in a number of\nbusiness ventures, and we’d discussed areas we might jointly explore. But I had\nalso received offers from think tanks in the United States.\n\n272\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011743\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Digital media providers do not “touch the plant” and generally do not need a cannabis-\nrelated license or permit. Digital media focused on cannabis is a niche sector within the broader digital\nmedia market. Companies in this segment compete for viewers and subscribers and generally draw\nrevenue from content licensing fees, service fees, advertisement fees and subscription fees. They provide\na broad range of content and networking tools, including news related to the cannabis industry and\nlegalization efforts, humor and entertainment focused on the cannabis-user demographic, traditional\nmedia and branding services, social networking tools that allow users to share pictures and information\nrelated to their cannabis activities, and business directory tools that connect industry participants.\n\nCannabis Digital Media\n\n58 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024694\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

They can, if they wish, manipulate any step of life inside their enclosed\norbs of power - and by extension, they can twist data and machines and you. The\nline between perverting search results and election results is a thin one. Such a\nmanipulation of data is trivial, which means the manipulation of you and 1 is,\ntechnically at least, trivial. It involves the laying of our preferences - what do we\nusually read, watch, who do we talk to, where do we live - against machine logic and\nvast data fields. Manipulation of data = Manipulation of us.\n\nThe idea of gatekeeping first emerged as it related to newspapers, back in the 1920s\nwhen politicians, advertisers and a few social scientists watched a print-information\nexplosion - and developed an uneasy feeling about how the world looked through\nmany newspapers. The personal whims of an editor, his political bent, his boss’\neconomic interest - all of these laid on “facts” like a heavy distorting blanket. Minor\ntwitches were turned into fear-mongering bait. Major global shifts were ignored.\nThe papers are (nearly) gone now, of course. And the idea of gatekeepers merely\nbending headlines to suit a personal whim seems charmingly nostalgic. Gatekeepers\ntoday have a far more profound, subtle reach. They might be governments or\nregulators or CEOs or machines or research committees, each controlling the design\nand development of some “rich get richer” tool we depend on and - by marking that\n“in or out” line - exerting historic, invisible control. Genetic engineering secrets.\nUnthrottled data flows. Product releases. Do you want accurate DNA analysis? Fast\nprotection from epidemic? A cyber-defense system? You can’t have any of these, you\nknow, unless you’re in someone’s fiercely guarded gateland. Even systems that look\nopen — the Internet, the world of US Dollar transactions, the election rolls - are\ngated in certain ways. Of course there is — at times - a balance between the\ngatekeepers and the gatekept, between those of us inside a system and the tools and\npeople who overmaster us. “In many cases, traditional literature focuses mainly on\ngatekeepers as elites who hold power in their hands while the gated are treated as\npowerless,” the information theorist Karine Nahon has written. “In networks,\nhowever, it is necessary to give sufficient weight to the role of the gated, since being\nsubject to gatekeeping does not imply that the gated are powerless, lack\nalternatives, or that gatekeeping is forced on them. Actually, being a gated\nsometimes is a matter of choice.”229 But sometimes, of course, it is also a matter of\ninarguable necessity.\n\nIn the slower, less wired worlds of our past, gates mattered too of course. Nations,\ngovernments, militaries, religious orders - all of these clustered behind (and\ndefended) marked lines. Map lines, front lines, dogmatic lines. The Triple Entente\nthat bound Britain, France and Russia together in the last century was as mucha\ngated system for their own security as the Peloponnesian League 2500 years earlier\nhad been. Deciding who could swap silk for spice beyond the Tang Dynasty’s border\nwas a gatekeeping choice, as consequential for Chinese strategists of the 8 Century\nas the decision about what might or might not be wheeled into the city was for the\n\n230 “In many cases”: Karine Barzilai-Nahon, “Toward a theory of network\ngatekeeping: A framework for exploring information control.” Journal of the America\nSociety for Information Science 59(9), 1493-1512.\n\n158\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018390\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

According to his plan, Gellman would break the\nPRISM story in the Washington Post and Greenwald would break the “mass domestic spying”\nstory in the Guardian. In addition, he insisted that the Guardian publish his personal manifesto\nalongside its story. As he envisioned it, the media event would also include a video component in\nwhich Greenwald would interview him.\n\nOnce Greenwald agreed to this micro-managing, Snowden would send him what he called a\n“welcome package” of documents to demonstrate his good faith. His plan also required a face-to-\nface meeting. When Greenwald said he was aboard the project, Snowden told him “the first order\nof business is to get you to Hong Kong.”\n\nSnowden next sent him 20 classified NSA documents labeled “TOP SECRET.” He also\nincluded in the package his personal manifesto, which asserted that the NSA was part of an\ninternational conspiracy of intelligence agencies that were working to “inflict upon the world a\nsystem of secret, pervasive surveillance from which there is no refuge.”\n\nMeanwhile, Snowden told Poitras, he was sending her a number of NSA documents including a\nrecent FISA warrant. It had been issued less than a month earlier. He wanted that FISA warrant\nto serve as the basis of Greenwald’s scoop. It was perfect whistle-blowing material for the\nGuardian because it ordered Verizon to turn over all its billing records for 90 days to the NSA.\nIt was as close to a smoking gun as anything he had copied at the NSA. It would also get\nattention since James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, had stated before Congress\njust two months earlier that the NSA did not collect phone data in America. This warrant would\nallow the Guardian, in the best tradition of “Gotcha” journalism, to catch Clapper in an apparent\nlie.\n\nContinuing his string-pulling, he instructed Poitras not to show the FISA warrant to\nGreenwald until they were safely aboard the plane. That measure would prevent Greenwald from\nreleasing the story without coming to Hong Kong. He also sent Poitras an entire encrypted file of\nNSA documents, saying it would “include my true name and details for the record, though it will\nbe your decision as to whether or how to declare my involvement.” He did not send her the key\nto decipher the file, saying “The key will follow when everything else is done.” He further told\nher that he preferred that her film focus on him as the sole perpetrator of the leak so that no one\nelse at the NSA would be suspected. He instructed her “Your destination is Hong Kong.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020246\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

For example, give any one of these animals a\nchoice between one piece of food and ten, and they will pick the ten. More is better than less, except if\nyou are a dieting human. Now give them a choice between one piece available immediately and ten pieces\navailable after some delay. Virtually every animal shifts to the one piece, with the only comparative\ndifference linked to the length of the delay — a few seconds for rats, birds, most monkeys, young\nchildren, and adults with frontal lobe damage, a few minutes for some apes, older children and some\nadults. Everyone is, to some extent, pulled by the hedonistic now. The future loses its luster when a tasty\nalternative is just within reach. This is in part due to the uncertainty associated with the future, and in\npart, the sheer temptation to take what is in front of us.\n\nUnique evolutionary changes in the human brain allowed us to exert much greater patience,\noverriding the pull of the hedonistic now. These changes didn’t evolve for punishment, but they were\nreadily deployed by this system of justice. We rely on creative strategies to place value on the future,\nincluding putting resources away so that we can’t use them — think savings accounts — and making\nverbal commitments that bind us to the future — think about the social embarrassment of failing in front\nof friends. These strategies help diminish the emotional pull of taking what is immediately available,\nallowing future benefits to gain in attractiveness. This is a brain that can wait for the delayed benefits of\npunishment.\n\nThe brain changes that facilitated our capacity to delay gratification were accompanied by others\nthat further offset the costs of punishment: our brains reward us with a feel-good feeling when we pay the\ncosts of punishment. For the first time in evolutionary history, the physical and psychological costs of\npunishment were at least partially offset by the pleasure of justice served, whether delivered directly or\nwitnessed from afar.\n\nWhen we punish or get even with those who have acted badly, we feel a hedonic high, an\nexperience captured by the metaphor “revenge is sweet but not fattening.” As demonstrated by the\neconomist Ernst Fehr, this is more than a metaphor. When we hand someone his just deserts, punishing\nsomeone for cheating, lying, or breaking a promise, our brain responds as if we handed ourselves just\ndesserts, activating brain circuitry associated with reward. In one study, two subjects played a monetary\nexchange game in which one player — the donor — decided how much of a pot of money to give to\nanother. A third player observed, out of view, the outcome of the exchange. In some cases, observers\nwitnessed a fair division of the money and in other cases, an unfair division in which the donor kept a\ndisproportionate amount of the total. The observer then faced a difficult decision: leave the two players\n\nwith their take-home earnings or use personal funds to take away money from the donor, returning it to\n\nHauser Chapter 1.

In an AGI architecture based on cognitive synergy, the different learning\nmechanisms must be designed specifically to interact in such a way as to palliate each others’\ncombinatorial explosions - so that, for instance, each learning mechanism dealing with a certain\nsort of knowledge, must synergize with learning mechanisms dealing with the other sorts of\nknowledge, in a way that decreases the severity of combinatorial explosion.\n\nOne prerequisite for cognitive synergy to work is that each learning mechanism must rec-\nognize when it is “stuck,” meaning it’s in a situation where it has inadequate information to\nmake a confident judgment about what steps to take next. Then, when it does recognize that\nit’s stuck, it may request help from other, complementary cognitive mechanisms.\n\n3.4 The General Structure of Cognitive Dynamics: Analysis and\nSynthesis\n\nWe have discussed the need for synergetic interrelation between cognitive processes correspond-\ning to different types of memory ... and the general high-level cognitive dynamics that a mind\nmust possess (evolution, autopoiesis). The next step is to dig further into the nature of the cog-\nnitive processes associated with different memory types and how they give rise to the needed\nhigh-level cognitive dynamics. In this section we present a general theory of cognitive processes\nbased on a decomposition of cognitive processes into the two categories of analysis and synthesis,\nand a general formulation of each of these categories 3.\n\nSpecifically we focus here on what we call focused cognitive processes; that is, cognitive\nprocesses that selectively focus attention on a subset of the patterns making up a mind. In\ngeneral these are not the only kind, there may also be global cognitive processes that act on\nevery pattern in a mind. An example of a global cognitive process in CogPrime is the basic\nattention allocation process, which spreads “importance” among all knowledge in the system’s\nmemory. Global cognitive processes are also important, but focused cognitive processes are\nsubtler to understand which is why we spend more time on them here.\n\n3.4.1 Component-Systems and Self-Generating Systems\n\nWe begin with autopoesis — and, more specifically, with the concept of a “component-system”,\nas described in George Kampis’s book Self-Modifying Systems in Biology and Cognitive Science\n[IKam91], and as modified into the concept of a “self-generating system” or SGS in Goertzel’s\nbook Chaotic Logic [Goe94].

I go by Ed\n\nMacAskill went on to ask him to enumerate the various positions he held during his career in\nintelligence. Snowden was not entirely truthful in describing himself. He said that he had been a\nsenior adviser to the CIA, when he had been just a telecommunications support officer in the CIA.\nHe also said he had been a senior adviser at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) even though,\naccording to that intelligence service, he was not actually ever employed there. (He merely spoke\nat an interagency counterintelligence course the DIA had sponsored.) He said he had a $200,000\na year salary from Booz Allen when, according to Booz Allen, it was $133,000. It is\nunderstandable that he wanted to impress these Guardian journalists in light of his young age and\nboyish appearance, even to the extent of meretriciously claiming in the video that he personally\nhad been given the “authority” at the NSA to intercept President Obama’s private\ncommunications, which, according to a NSA spokeswoman, was not true. No NSA employee,\nand certainly not a civilian contract worker, was given the authority to soy on the President of the\nUnited States, she insisted. Such career enhancements suggest that Snowden altered factual\nreality when it suits his purpose with journalists.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020252\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But I just showed why I model all consumption after, or anyhow after a few\nmonths of job training, as Schultz’ pure kind. Here I would fault Mincer and his pupil\nBecker, but not Schultz or Ben-Porath, for too much focus on the potential of job\ntraining. It exists and is crucial. But it is so small a fraction of invested consumption,\njudging from my experience, that I prefer to neglect it in modeling. Job learning,\n\nconversely, seems to explain all rise in pay with age.\n\nBiology might predict the same. Nature’s plan is that we first develop and then\nreproduce. Some creatures follow sharply-defined somatic and reproductive phases\nshowing first only development and then only reproduction. A mature butterfly\ndoes not eat. It may even lose mouth parts. Its time is spent in reproduction alone.\nOther creatures including us like eating too, but nature gives them that taste for the\nsake of the one behind. Adult consumption, as | see it, is more or less all pure\nconsumption exhausted from total capital in satisfying our taste for life and energy.\nConsumption by the young is invested because that is the big idea. Nature’s plan is\n\nreproduction to maturity.\n\nNow suppose for simplicity that consumption is age-independent. Nobelists Milton\nFriedman and Franco Modigliani, mentioned earlier for their opposite reactions to\nmy banking idea, separately argued something like that in the 1950s for adults. My\nextension backward to birth seems defensible when we remember to include\nunpaid parental care and then schooling in invested consumption. I model human\ncapital as continuing after retirement as present value of implicit pay by ourselves\nand others for caring for ourselves and those others. Then if adulthood runs from\nages 20 to 80, those simplifying assumptions would give pure consumption as three\n\nfourths of all consumption.\n\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 12\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011031\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This is where things get interesting as these other factors\ndetermine the start and end of a contest.\n\nInsights into the dynamics of aggressive competition emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s\ndue to two fundamental developments within evolutionary biology. The first involved a marriage\nbetween economic game theory and evolutionary biology. This marriage was set up by the British\nevolutionary biologist John Maynard Smith who recognized that for any competitive interaction, there are\ndifferent strategies, each with different payoffs. Some strategies are more costly, but return greater\nbenefits. Others are more conservative and less costly, but return smaller benefits. How well any given\nstrategy does depends on its frequency in the population, and thus, on whether the particular strategy is\ndominant or rare. For example, consider a baboon troop with 20 adult males. Imagine that one of the\nmales decides to bare his canines, stand up on his two hind legs, and charge whenever anyone comes near\nhim and he is eating. This male is displaying his intent to attack at the slightest provocation. One could\nimagine that this would be very effective, especially if he is the only one displaying in this way. But if\nthis display pattern spreads, and all 19 other males do the same thing, then this strategy fails as it no\nlonger distinguishes among the 20 males in the troop. What evolutionary game theory tells us is that the\neffectiveness of a strategy depends on how common it is within the population. Power comes, in part,\nfrom being not too common or predictable.\n\nThe second development involved signaling theory, and a challenge to the traditional approach\nthat considered animal signals as truthful messengers of information. On the traditional view, when a\nmonkey bares his canines, he is signaling his motivation to attack. When a dog puts his tail between his\nlegs, he is signaling his submissive status. When a bird gives an alarm call, she is telling others that a\npredator is nearby. When a human smiles, he is conveying his desire for friendship. The new signaling\ntheory presented a challenge to this honest view of communication. Why, for example, wouldn’t\nindividuals lie, deceiving others into believing that they were really tough, meek, in danger, or friendly,\nonly to take advantage of the situation and gain added resources. Why, for example, wouldn’t a baboon\nwho was actually afraid, put on a tough-guy show and scare off his opponents? Why wouldn’t a dog who\nwas actually tough, send a submissive signal at the start of the interaction, cause his opponent to lower his\nguard, and then attack? Why wouldn’t a bird send an alarm in the absence of danger, knowing that others\nwill run for cover and leave all the food behind — no competition? Why wouldn’t a human who actually\nwanted to lure in an innocent victim for robbery send a seductive smile? This line of questioning,\ndeveloped by the British evolutionary biologists Richard Dawkins and John Krebs, led to a number of\nstudies showing that animals are engaged in a much more complicated and dynamic dance when they\ncompete. Static properties of the animal — its height, weight, tail length, antler size — indicate its raw,\n\nunfakeable ability to fight or what biologists call Resource Holding Potential or RHP.

Just as no question was was unaskable, no place\nwas too far off to possess or exploit. No position was secured by history or distance\nor sentiment. This was, for instance, the lesson taught to Lin Zexu, the Qing Dynasty\nbureaucrat sent out from Beijing in 1839 to stop the British opium sales that were\nreducing China to a drugged, useless coma. “Suppose there were people from\nanother country who carried opium for sale to England and seduced your people\ninto buying and smoking it?” Lin wrote the Queen. “Certainly your honorable ruler\nwould deeply hate it and be bitterly aroused?” Lin thought that he was speaking as\nthe voice of a great, eternal empire.

The weapons had first appeared in the mid-1800s on battlefields in the\nAmerican Civil War, after the inventor Richard Gatling sent a package of samples to\nthe White House and convinced President Lincoln - a famous gadget freak - that\ntheir firepower might bring the Civil War to a faster close. Lincoln ordered the Army\nto try the guns, but Gatling’s early attempts were honestly too immature to tell\ndecisively on the battlefields of the American south. Within a few decades, however,\nthe guns were perfected in places like Africa, or on the frontlines of the 1904 Russo-\nJapanese War. They represented a compelling, inarguable logic of industrial war: A\nmachine and a gun. We mowed them down like grass. You could read that line as\nmetaphor: Mowing grass was, in the end, the act of a machine killing a wild, natural\nworld into a clean, useful order. The Europeans were the grass-clipping machine;\nthe rest of the world was, well, the grass. For a colonial temperament hardened for\n“The Great Game” of empire on the playing fields of Eton, preparing a lawn for\ntennis and a territory for exploitation were not particularly distinct acts.\n\nThe Shangani battle gunshots struck the European mind as powerful confirmation of\neverything they suspected about the magic violence of an industrial age. The image\nof such a device suited the aggressive, engineering-led mood of era. As Gatling - and\nhis competitor Hiram Maxim - peddled the guns, they faced a predictable resistance,\nof course: Europe’s cavalry officers were in love with their well-bred horses. But the\nage was, finally, the story of aggressive industry flattening old habits. Trains were\nassaulting the countryside. Factories were pounding apart the habits of labor. Social\nstampedes of speed-climbing nouveau riche, political attacks of new industrial\nunions and counter attacks all expressed this aggressive energy.

The success of any dispensary operator or distribu-\ntor depends on anticipating and complying with these regulations.\n\nTax Issues Related to Distribution. States and localities that legalize cannabis are focused on the\npotential to generate tax revenue from the industry. Ambiguous, constantly changing and potentially\nburdensome taxation rules may make it difficult for dispensary operators or distributors to remain in\ngood standing with licensing, regulatory and tax collection agencies and may negatively impact their\nfinancial results.\n\nDistribution Outlook\n\nWe expect dispensaries across the United States to increasingly seek to provide modern retail experi-\nences that are supported by e-commerce applications. We also expect that the most well-run dispensa-\nries will continue to generate significant cash flow at compelling margins. Dispensaries should be able\nto gain advantage by producing their own products, by developing strategic or exclusive relationships\nwith specialty producers or by finding ways to generate customer loyalty. However, oversaturation\nin the number of dispensaries in certain jurisdictions, such as Colorado, has led to a very competi-\ntive environment, consolidation and moratoriums on issuing new local dispensary licenses by various\nmunicipalities.\n\nThe distribution segment is subject to some of the strictest and most frequently changing regu-\nlations applicable to the cannabis industry. While distribution opportunities may arise with changes\nin law, some legislation may cause significant disruption. For example, the number of dispensaries\noperating in the greater Los Angeles region is expected to decrease significantly in the short term as\nCalifornia’s new cannabis regulatory agency begins its oversight and enforcement efforts in 2018.\n\nThe distribution services subsegment in the United States is still in its infancy and has experienced\na number of growing pains related to a lack of well-established distribution channels. For example, a\nNevada law generally requiring dispensaries to use third-party distributors proved troublesome when\ndispensaries sold out of product within 48 hours after legal recreational cannabis sales commenced in\nthe state. As more distribution channels and points of contact are established, we believe that opportu-\nnities for third-party distribution services companies will increase.\n\nIn certain legalized international markets, such as Germany and Uruguay, cannabis products\nare sold primarily through existing pharmacy networks (Argentina plans to do the same). While\ncannabis-derived pharmaceuticals may ultimately be distributed the same way in the United States,\nwe believe the future domestic distribution channels of other types of cannabis products will closely\nresemble those of alcohol and tobacco products.\n\n44 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024680\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I was worried we’d end up waking the Syrians. But just as I was\nfiguring out how to make sure we got past them before that happened, Avi drew\nup beside me.\n\n“Ehud,” he whispered. “It’s 1:15. The command post ordered us to turn\nback.”\n\n“Turn off the radio,” I said, my hand on his elbow, reassuringly I hoped, as I\nled him and the others back a full 100 feet from the Syrians. We took a wider\nroute around the camp. We moved much more quickly on the final mile to the\nroad that led toward Quneitra. We were now well clear of the camp, and I felt it\nwas unlikely we’d run into a patrol. I was also confident we’d have an easier\nreturn trip. I knew what had held us up on the way in: finding a path on the\nplateau clear of mines, figuring out how to cross the river, and the general\nunfamiliarity of the terrain. None of those applied now. I felt we could get the\nbugging job done and still be back before dawn. As we got nearer the road, Avi\nasked me a couple of more times whether he should turn the radio back on.\n“No,” I kept telling him. “It’s OK. Pl tell you when.”\n\nIt was about two in the morning when we reached the road. We found a\ntelephone pole set back on the edge of a field. Moshiko hoisted himself onto\nKuti Sharabi’s shoulders, clambered up the pole and installed the bugging\ndevice. The entire operation took him less than 10 minutes. We moved more\nquickly on the way back. By around 3:30, we had crossed the river. “You can\nturn on the radio now,” I told Avi, who was obviously relieved. He handed it to\nme. Using our agreed code words, I reported our location, and added the phrase\nfor “mission accomplished.”\n\nWhen we began our final descent, it was starting to get light. I assumed we\nwere near enough to the border to make it unlikely we’d be shot at. Still, there\nwas a danger we’d be spotted by a patrol, so I was relieved when we reached the\nmound of boulders, more than ten feet high, that served as a tank barrier outside\nKibbutz Dan. When we stepped behind it, I saw that not only Avraham, but\nMeir Amit as well, were waiting. The Head of Military Intelligence said\nnothing. He didn’t have to. He just shook my hand, beaming. Avraham grabbed\neach of us, one by one, in a bear hug.\n\nThen, drawing me aside, Avraham said that I had only narrowly missed\nlanding in deep trouble. I assumed my transgression was shutting off the radio\nand disobeying the order to return. That was just part of the problem, however.\n\n70\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027918\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But pierce his\nair of mystery and the picture changes. Vicky Ward explores Epstein’s investment career, his ties\nto retail magnate Leslie Wexner, and his complicated past.\nby\n�\nVicky Ward\nJune 27, 2011 12:00 am\nOn Manhattan’s Upper East Side, home to some of the most expensive real estate on earth, exists\nthe crown jewel of the city’s residential town houses. With its 15-foot-high oak door, huge\narched windows, and nine floors, it sits on—or, rather, commands—the block of 71st Street\nbetween Fifth and Madison Avenues. Almost ludicrously out of proportion with its four- and\nfive-story neighbors, it seems more like an institution than a house. This is perhaps not\nsurprising—until 1989 it was the Birch Wathen private school. Now it is said to be Manhattan’s\nlargest private residence.\nInside, amid the flurry of menservants attired in sober black suits and pristine white gloves, you\nfeel you have stumbled into someone’s private Xanadu. This is no mere rich person’s home, but\na high-walled, eclectic, imperious fantasy that seems to have no boundaries.\nThe entrance hall is decorated not with paintings but with row upon row of individually framed\neyeballs; these, the owner tells people with relish, were imported from England, where they were\nmade for injured soldiers. Next comes a marble foyer, which does have a painting, in the manner\nof Jean Dubuffet … but the host coyly refuses to tell visitors who painted it. In any case, guests\nare like pygmies next to the nearby twice-life-size sculpture of a naked African warrior.\nDespite its eccentricity the house is curiously impersonal, the statement of someone who wants\nto be known for the scale of his possessions. Its occupant, financier Jeffrey Epstein, 50, admits to\nfriends that he likes it when people think of him this way. A good-looking man, resembling\nRalph Lauren, with thick gray-white hair and a weathered face, he usually dresses in jeans, knit\nshirts, and loafers. He tells people he bought the house because he knew he “could never live\nanywhere bigger.” He thinks 51,000 square feet is an appropriately large space for someone like\nhimself, who deals mostly in large concepts—especially large sums of money.\nGuests are invited to lunch or dinner at the town house—Epstein usually refers to the former as\n“tea,” since he likes to eat bite-size morsels and drink copious quantities of Earl Grey. (He does\nnot touch alcohol or tobacco.) Tea is served in the “leather room,” so called because of the\ncordovan-colored fabric on the walls. The chairs are covered in a leopard print, and on the wall\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 3 of 16\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303\nhangs a huge, Oriental fantasy of a woman holding an opium pipe and caressing a snarling\nlionskin. Under her gaze, plates of finger sandwiches are delivered to Epstein and guests by the\nmenservants in white gloves.\nUpstairs, to the right of a spiral staircase, is the “office,” an enormous gallery spanning the width\nof the house. Strangely, it holds no computer. Computers belong in the “computer room” (a\nsmaller room at the back of the house), Epstein has been known to say. The office features a\ngilded desk (which Epstein tells people belonged to banker J. P. Morgan), 18th-century black\nlacquered Portuguese cabinets, and a nine-foot ebony Steinway “D” grand. On the desk, a\npaperback copy of the Marquis de Sade’s The Misfortunes of Virtue was recently spotted.\nCovering the floor, Epstein has explained, “is the largest Persian rug you’ll ever see in a private\nhome—so big, it must have come from a mosque.” Amid such splendor, much of which reflects\nthe work of the French decorator Alberto Pinto, who has worked for Jacques Chirac and the\nroyal families of Jordan and Saudi Arabia, there is one particularly startling oddity: a stuffed\nblack poodle, standing atop the grand piano. “No decorator would ever tell you to do that,”\nEpstein brags to visitors. “But I want people to think what it means to stuff a dog.” People can’t\nhelp but feel it’s Epstein’s way of saying that he always has the last word.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn addition to the town house, Epstein lives in what is reputed to be the largest private dwelling\nin New Mexico, on an $18 million, 7,500-acre ranch which he named “Zorro.” “It makes the\ntown house look like a shack,” Epstein has said. He also owns Little St. James, a 70-acre island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, where the main house is currently being renovated by Edward Tuttle,\na designer of the Amanresorts. There is also a $6.8 million house in Palm Beach, Florida, and a\nfleet of aircraft: a Gulfstream IV, a helicopter, and a Boeing 727, replete with trading room, on\nwhich Epstein recently flew President Clinton, actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey,\nsupermarket magnate Ron Burkle, Lew Wasserman’s grandson, Casey Wasserman, and a few\nothers, on a mission to explore the problems of AIDS and economic development in Africa.\nEpstein is charming, but he doesn’t let the charm slip into his eyes. They are steely and\ncalculating, giving some hint at the steady whir of machinery running behind them. “Let’s play\nchess,” he said to me, after refusing to give an interview for this article. “You be white. You get\nthe first move.” It was an appropriate metaphor for a man who seems to feel he can win no\nmatter what the advantage of the other side. His advantage is that no one really seems to know\nhim or his history completely or what his arsenal actually consists of. He has carefully\nengineered it so that he remains one of the few truly baffling mysteries among New York’s\nmoneyed world. People know snippets, but few know the whole.\n“He’s very enigmatic,” says Rosa Monckton, the former C.E.O. of Tiffany & Co. in the U.K. and\na close friend since the early 1980s. “You think you know him and then you peel off another ring\nof the onion skin and there’s something else extraordinary underneath. He never reveals his\nhand…. He’s a classic iceberg. What you see is not what you get.”\nEven acquaintances sense a curious dichotomy: Yes, he lives like a “modern maharaja,” as Leah\nKleman, one of his art dealers, puts it. Yet he is fastidiously, almost obsessively private—he lists\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 4 of 16\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303\nhimself in the phone book under a pseudonym. He rarely attends society gatherings or weddings\nor funerals; he considers eating in restaurants like “eating on the subway”—i.e., something he’d\nnever do. There are many women in his life, mostly young, but there is no one of them to whom\nhe has been able to commit. He describes his most public companion of the last decade,\nGhislaine Maxwell, 41, the daughter of the late, disgraced media baron Robert Maxwell, as\nsimply his “best friend.” He says she is not on his payroll, but she seems to organize much of his\nlife—recently she was making telephone inquiries to find a California-based yoga instructor for\nhim. (Epstein is still close to his two other long-term girlfriends, Paula Heil Fisher, a former\nassociate of his at the brokerage firm Bear Stearns and now an opera producer, and Eva\nAndersson Dubin, a doctor and onetime model. He tells people that when a relationship is over\nthe girlfriend “moves up, not down,” to friendship status.)\nSome of the businessmen who dine with him at his home—they include newspaper publisher\nMort Zuckerman, banker Louis Ranieri, Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman, real-estate tycoon\nLeon Black, former Microsoft executive Nathan Myhrvold, Tom Pritzker (of Hyatt Hotels), and\nreal-estate personality Donald Trump—sometimes seem not all that clear as to what he actually\ndoes to earn his millions. Certainly, you won’t find Epstein’s transactions written about on\nBloomberg or talked about in the trading rooms. “The trading desks don’t seem to know him. It’s\nunusual for animals that big not to leave any footprints in the snow,” says a high-level\ninvestment manager.\nADVERTISEMENT\nUnlike such fund managers as George Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller, whose client lists and\nstock maneuverings act as their calling cards, Epstein keeps all his deals and clients secret, bar\none client: billionaire Leslie Wexner, the respected chairman of Limited Brands. Epstein insists\nthat ever since he left Bear Stearns in 1981 he has managed money only for billionaires—who\ndepend on him for discretion. “I was the only person crazy enough, or arrogant enough, or\nmisplaced enough, to make my limit a billion dollars or more,” he tells people freely. According\nto him, the flat fees he receives from his clients, combined with his skill at playing the currency\nmarkets “with very large sums of money,” have afforded him the lifestyle he enjoys today.\nWhy do billionaires choose him as their trustee? Because the problems of the mega-rich, he tells\npeople, are different from yours and mine, and his unique philosophy is central to understanding\nthose problems: “Very few people need any more money when they have a billion dollars. The\nkey is not to have it do harm more than anything else…. You don’t want to lose your money.”\nHe has likened his job to that of an architect—more specifically, one who specializes in\nremodeling: “I always describe [a billionaire] as someone who started out in a small home and as\nhe became wealthier had add-ons. He added on another addition, he built a room over the garage\n… until you have a house that is usually a mess…. It’s a large house that has been put together\nover time where no one could foretell the financial future and their accompanying needs.”\nHe makes it sound as though his job combines the roles of real-estate agent, accountant, lawyer,\nmoney manager, trustee, and confidant. But, as with Jay Gatsby, myths and rumor swirl around\nEpstein.\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 5 of 16\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303\nHere are some of the hard facts about Epstein—ones that he doesn’t mind people knowing: He\ngrew up middle-class in Brooklyn. His father worked for the city’s parks department. His parents\nviewed education as “the way out” for him and his younger brother, Mark, now working in real\nestate. Jeffrey started to play the piano—for which he maintains a passion—at five, and he went\nto Brooklyn’s Lafayette High School. He was good at mathematics, and in his early 20s he got a\njob teaching physics and math at Dalton, the elite Manhattan private school. While there he\nbegan tutoring the son of Bear Stearns chairman Ace Greenberg and was friendly with a\ndaughter of Greenberg’s. Soon he went to Bear Stearns, where, under the mentorship of both\nGreenberg and current Bear Stearns C.E.O. James Cayne, he did well enough to become a\nlimited partner—a rung beneath full partner. He abruptly departed in 1981 because, he has said,\nhe wanted to run his own business.\nThereafter the details recede into shadow. A few of the handful of current friends who have\nknown him since the early 1980s recall that he used to tell them he was a “bounty hunter,”\nrecovering lost or stolen money for the government or for very rich people. He has a license to\ncarry a firearm. For the last 15 years, he’s been running his business, J. Epstein & Co.\nSince Leslie Wexner appeared in his life—Epstein has said this was in 1986; others say it was in\n1989, at the earliest—he has gradually, in a way that has not generally made headlines, come to\nbe accepted by the Establishment. He’s a member of various commissions and councils: he is on\nthe Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the New York Academy of\nSciences, and the Institute of International Education.\nHis current fan club extends to Cayne, Henry Rosovsky, the former dean of Harvard’s Faculty of\nArts and Sciences, and Larry Summers, Harvard’s current president. Harvard law professor Alan\nDershowitz says, “I’m on my 20th book…. The only person outside of my immediate family that\nI send drafts to is Jeffrey.” Real-estate developer and philanthropist Marshall Rose, who has\nworked with Epstein on projects in New Albany, Ohio, for Wexner, says, “He digests and\ndecodes the information very rapidly, which is to me terrific because we have shorter meetings.”\nAlso on the list of admirers are former senator George Mitchell and a gaggle of distinguished\nscientists, most of whom Epstein has helped fund in recent years. They include Nobel Prize\nwinners Gerald Edelman and Murray Gell-Mann, and mathematical biologist Martin Nowak.\nWhen these men describe Epstein, they talk about “energy” and “curiosity,” as well as a love for\ntheoretical physics that they don’t ordinarily find in laymen. Gell-Mann rather sweetly mentions\nthat “there are always pretty ladies around” when he goes to dinner chez Epstein, and he’s under\nthe impression that Epstein’s clients include the Queen of England. Both Nowak and Dershowitz\nwere thrilled to find themselves shaking the hand of a man named “Andrew” in Epstein’s house.\n“Andrew” turned out to be Prince Andrew, who subsequently arranged to sit in the back of\nDershowitz’s law class.\nEpstein gets annoyed when anyone suggests that Wexner “made him.” “I had really rich clients\nbefore,” he has said. Yet he does not deny that he and Wexner have a special relationship.\nEpstein sees it as a partnership of equals. “People have said it’s like we have one brain between\ntwo of us: each has a side.”\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 6 of 16\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303\n“I think we both possess the skill of seeing patterns,” says Wexner. “But Jeffrey sees patterns in\npolitics and financial markets, and I see patterns in lifestyle and fashion trends. My skills are not\nin investment strategy, and, as everyone who knows Jeffrey knows, his are not in fashion and\ndesign. We frequently discuss world trends as each of us sees them.”\nBy the time Epstein met Wexner, the latter was a retail legend who had built a $3 billion\nempire—one that now includes Victoria’s Secret, Express, and Bath & Body Works—from\n$5,000 lent him by his aunt. “Wexner saw in Jeffrey the type of person who had the potential to\nrealize his [Jeffrey’s] dreams,” says someone who has worked closely with both men. “He gave\nJeffrey the ball, and Jeffrey hit it out of the park.”\nWexner, through a trust, bought the town house in which Epstein now lives for a reported $13.2\nmillion in 1989. In 1993, Wexner married Abigail Koppel, a 31-year-old lawyer, and the\nnewlyweds relocated to Ohio; in 1996, Epstein moved into the town house. Public documents\nsuggest that the house is still owned by the trust that bought it, but Epstein has said that he now\nowns the house.\nWexner trusts Epstein so completely that he has assigned him the power of fiduciary over all of\nhis private trusts and foundations, says a source close to Wexner. In 1992, Epstein even\npersuaded Wexner to put him on the board of the Wexner Foundation in place of Wexner’s ailing\nmother. Bella Wexner recovered and demanded to be reinstated. Epstein has said they settled by\nsplitting the foundation in two.\nEpstein does not care that he comes between family members. In fact, he sees it as his job. He\ntells people, “I am there to represent my client, and if my client needs protecting—sometimes\neven from his own family—then it’s often better that people hate me, not the client.”\n“You’ve probably heard I’m vicious in my representation of my clients,” he tells people proudly;\nLeah Kleman describes his haggling over art prices as something like a scene out of the movie\nMad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. Even a former mentor says he’s seen “the dark side” of\nEpstein, and a Bear Stearns source recalls a meeting in which Epstein chewed out a team making\na presentation for Wexner as being so brutal as to be “irresponsible.”\nOne reporter, in fact, received three threats from Epstein while preparing a piece. They were\ndelivered in a jocular tone, but the message was clear: There will be trouble for your family if I\ndon’t like the article.\nOn the other hand, Epstein is clearly very generous with friends. Joe Pagano, an Aspen-based\nventure capitalist, who has known Epstein since before his Bear Stearns days, can’t say enough\nnice things: “I have a boy who’s dyslexic, and Jeffrey’s gotten close to him over the years….\nJeffrey got him into music. He bought him his first piano. And then as he got to school he had\ndifficulty … in studying … so Jeffrey got him interested in taking flying lessons.”\nRosa Monckton recalls Epstein telling her that her daughter, Domenica, who suffers from Down\nsyndrome, needed the sun, and that Rosa should feel free to bring her to his house in Palm Beach\nanytime.\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 7 of 16\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303\nSome friends remember that in the late 80s Epstein would offer to upgrade the airline tickets of\ngood friends by affixing first-class stickers; the only problem was that the stickers turned out to\nbe unofficial. Sometimes the technique worked, but other times it didn’t, and the unwitting\nrecipients found themselves exiled to coach. (Epstein has claimed that he paid for the upgrades,\nand had no knowledge of the stickers.) Many of those who benefited from Epstein’s largesse\nclaim that his generosity comes with no strings attached. “I never felt he wanted anything from\nme in return,” says one old friend, who received a first-class upgrade.\nEpstein is known about town as a man who loves women—lots of them, mostly young. Model\ntypes have been heard saying they are full of gratitude to Epstein for flying them around, and he\nis a familiar face to many of the Victoria’s Secret girls. One young woman recalls being\nsummoned by Ghislaine Maxwell to a concert at Epstein’s town house, where the women\nseemed to outnumber the men by far. “These were not women you’d see at Upper East Side\ndinners,” the woman recalls. “Many seemed foreign and dressed a little bizarrely.” This same\nguest also attended a cocktail party thrown by Maxwell that Prince Andrew attended, which was\nfilled, she says, with young Russian models. “Some of the guests were horrified,” the woman\nsays.\n“He’s reckless,” says a former business associate, “and he’s gotten more so. Money does that to\nyou. He’s breaking the oath he made to himself—that he would never do anything that would\nexpose him in the media. Right now, in the wake of the publicity following his trip with Clinton,\nhe must be in a very difficult place.”\nAccording to S.E.C. and other legal documents unearthed by VANITY FAIR, Epstein may have\ngood reason to keep his past cloaked in secrecy: his real mentor, it might seem, was not Leslie\nWexner but Steven Jude Hoffenberg, 57, who, for a few months before the S.E.C. sued to freeze\nhis assets in 1993, was trying to buy the New York Post. He is currently incarcerated in the\nFederal Medical Center in Devens, Massachusetts, serving a 20-year sentence for bilking\ninvestors out of more than $450 million in one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American history.\nWhen Epstein met Hoffenberg in London in the 1980s, the latter was the charismatic, audacious\nhead of the Towers Financial Corporation, a collection agency that was supposed to buy debts\nthat people owed to hospitals, banks, and phone companies. But Hoffenberg began using\ncompany funds to pay off earlier investors and service a lavish lifestyle that included a mansion\non Long Island, homes on Manhattan’s Sutton Place and in Florida, and a fleet of cars and\nplanes.\nHoffenberg and Epstein had much in common. Both were smart and obsessed with making\nmoney. Both were from Brooklyn. According to Hoffenberg, the two men were introduced by\nDouglas Leese, a defense contractor. Epstein has said they were introduced by John Mitchell, the\nlate attorney general.\nEpstein had been running International Assets Group Inc. (I.A.G.), a consulting company, out of\nhis apartment in the Solo building on East 66th Street in New York. Though he has claimed that\nhe managed money for billionaires only, in a 1989 deposition he testified that he spent 80\npercent of his time assisting people recover stolen money from fraudulent brokers and lawyers.\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 8 of 16\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303\nHe was also not above entering into risky, tax-sheltered oil and gas deals with much smaller\ninvestors. A lawsuit that Michael Stroll, the former head of Williams Electronics Inc., filed\nagainst Epstein shows that in 1982 I.A.G. received an investment from Stroll of $450,000, which\nEpstein put into oil. In 1984 Stroll asked for his money back; four years later he had received\nonly $10,000. Stroll lost the suit, after Epstein claimed in court, among other things, that the\ncheck for $10,000 was for a horse he’d bought from Stroll. “My net worth never exceeded four\nand a half million dollars,” Stroll has said.\nHoffenberg, says a close friend, “really liked Jeffrey…. Jeffrey has a way of getting under your\nskin, and he was under Hoffenberg’s.” Also appealing to Hoffenberg were Epstein’s social\nconnections; they included oil mogul Cece Wang (father of the designer Vera) and Mohan\nMurjani, whose clothing company grew into Gloria Vanderbilt Jeans. Epstein lived large even\nthen. One friend recalls that when he took Canadian heiress Wendy Belzberg on a date he hired a\nRolls-Royce especially for the occasion. (Epstein has claimed he owned it.)\nIn 1987, Hoffenberg, according to sources, set Epstein up in the offices he still occupies in the\nVillard House, on Madison Avenue, across a courtyard from the restaurant Le Cirque.\nHoffenberg hired his new protégé as a consultant at $25,000 a month, and the relationship\nflourished. “They traveled everywhere together—on Hoffenberg’s plane, all around the world,\nthey were always together,” says a source. Hoffenberg has claimed that Epstein confided in him,\nsaying, for example, that he had left Bear Stearns in 1981 after he was discovered executing\n“illegal operations.”\nSeveral of Epstein’s Bear Stearns contemporaries recall that Epstein left the company very\nsuddenly. Within the company there were rumors also that he was involved in a technical\ninfringement, and it was thought that the executive committee asked that he resign after his two\nsupporters, Ace Greenberg and Jimmy Cayne, were outnumbered. Greenberg says he can’t recall\nthis; Cayne denies it happened, and Epstein has denied it as well. “Jeffrey Epstein left Bear\nStearns of his own volition,” says Cayne. “It was never suggested that he leave by any member\nof management, and management never looked into any improprieties by him. Jeffrey said\nspecifically, ‘I don’t want to work for anybody else. I want to work for myself.’” Yet, this is not\nthe story that Epstein told to the S.E.C. in 1981 and to lawyers in a 1989 deposition involving a\ncivil business case in Philadelphia.\nIn 1981 the S.E.C.’s Jonathan Harris and Robert Blackburn took Epstein’s testimony and that of\nother Bear Stearns employees in part of what became a protracted case about insider trading\naround a tender offer placed on March 11, 1981, by the Seagram Company Ltd. for St. Joe\nMinerals Corp. Ultimately several Italian and Swiss investors were found guilty, including\nItalian financier Giuseppe Tome, who had used his relationship with Seagram owner Edgar\nBronfman Sr. to obtain information about the tender offer.\nAfter the tender offer was announced, the S.E.C. began investigating trades involving St. Joe at\nBear Stearns and other firms. Epstein resigned from Bear Stearns on March 12. The S.E.C. was\ntipped off that Epstein had information on insider trading at Bear Stearns, and it was therefore\nobliged to question him. In his S.E.C. testimony, given on April 1, 1981, Epstein claimed that he\nhad found “offensive” the way Bear Stearns management had handled a disciplinary action\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 9 of 16\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303\nfollowing its discovery that he had committed a possible “Reg D” violation—evidently he had\nlent money to his closest friend. (In the 1989 deposition he said that he’d lent approximately\n$20,000 to Warren Eisenstein, to buy stock.) Such an action could have been considered\nimproper, although Epstein claimed he had not realized this until afterward.\nAccording to Epstein, Bear Stearns management had questioned him about the loan around\nMarch 4. The questioners, Epstein said, were Michael (Mickey) Tarnopol and Alvin Einbender.\nIn his 1989 deposition Epstein recalled that the partner who had made an “issue” of the matter\nwas Marvin Davidson. On March 9, Epstein said, he had met with Tarnopol and Einbender\nagain, and the two partners told him that the executive committee had weighed the offense,\ntogether with previous “carelessness” over expenses, and he would be fined $2,500.\n“There was discussion whether, in fact, I had ever put in an airline ticket for someone else and\nnot myself and I said that it was possible, … since my secretary handles my expenses,” Epstein\ntold the S.E.C. In his 1989 testimony he stated that the “Reg D” incident had cost him a shot at\npartnership that year.\nWhat the S.E.C. seemed to be especially interested in was whether there was a connection\nbetween Epstein’s leaving and the alleged insider trading in St. Joe Minerals by other people at\nBear Stearns:\nQ: Sir, are you aware that certain rumors may have been circulating around your firm in\nconnection with your reasons for leaving the firm?\nA: I’m aware that there were many rumors.\nQ: What were the rumors you heard?\nA: Nothing to do with St. Joe.\nQ: Can you relate what you heard?\nA: It was having to do with an illicit affair with a secretary.\nQ: Have you heard any other rumors suggesting that you had made a presentation or\ncommunication to the Executive Committee concerning alleged improprieties by other members\nor employees of Bear Stearns?\nA: I, in fact, have heard that rumor, but it’s been from Mr. Harris in our conversation last week.\nQ: Have you heard it from anyone else?\nA: No.\nA little later the interview focuses on James Cayne:\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 10 of 16\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303\nQ: Did you ever hear while you were at Bear Stearns that Mr. Cayne may have trader or insider\ninformation in connection with St. Joe Minerals Corporation?\nQ: Did Mr. Cayne ever have any conversation with you about St. Joe Minerals?\nQ: Did you happen to overhear any conversations between Mr. Cayne and anyone else regarding\nSt. Joe Minerals?\nAnd still later in the questioning comes this exchange:\nQ: Have you had any type of business dealings with Mr. Cayne?\nA: There’s no relationship with Bear Stearns.\nQ: Pardon?\nA: Other than Bear Stearns, no.\nQ: Have you been a participant in any type of business venture with Mr. Cayne?\nQ: Do you have any expectation of participating in any business venture with Mr. Cayne?\nQ: Have you had any business participations with Mr. Theram?\nA: No; nor do I anticipate any.\nQ: Mr. Epstein, did anyone at Bear Stearns tell you in words or substance that you should not\ndivulge anything about St. Joe Minerals to the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission?\nQ: Has anyone indicated to you in any way, either directly or indirectly, in words or substance,\nthat your compensation for this past year or any future monies coming to you from Bear Stearns\nwill be contingent upon your not divulging information to the Securities and Exchange\nCommission?\nA: No.\nDespite the circumstances of Epstein’s leaving, Bear Stearns agreed to pay him his annual\nbonus—which he anticipated as being approximately $100,000.\nThe S.E.C. never brought any charges against anyone at Bear Stearns for insider trading in St.\nJoe, but its questioning seems to indicate that it was skeptical of Epstein’s answers. Some\nsources have wondered why, if he was such a big producer at Bear Stearns, he would have given\nit up over a mere $2,500 fine.\nCertainly the years after Epstein left the firm were not obviously prosperous ones. His luck\ndidn’t seem to change until he met Hoffenberg.\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 11 of 16\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303\nOne of Epstein’s first assignments for Hoffenberg was to mastermind doomed bids to take over\nPan American World Airways in 1987 and Emery Air Freight Corp. in 1988. Hoffenberg\nclaimed in a 1993 hearing before a grand jury in Illinois that Epstein came up with the idea of\nfinancing these bids through Towers’s acquisition of two ailing Illinois insurance companies,\nAssociated Life and United Fire. “He was hired by us to work on the securities side of the\ninsurance companies and Towers Financial, supposedly to make a profit for us and for the\ncompanies,” Hoffenberg reportedly told the grand jury. He also alleged that Epstein was the\n“technician,” executing the schemes, although, having no broker’s license, he had to rely on\nothers to make the trades. Much of Hoffenberg’s subsequent testimony in his criminal case has\nproven to be false, and Epstein has claimed he was merely asked how the bids could be\naccomplished and has said he had nothing to do with the financing of them. Yet Richard Allen,\nthe former treasurer of United Fire, recalls seeing Epstein two or three times at the company. He\nand another executive say they had direct dealing with Epstein over the finances. And in his\ndeposition of 1989, Epstein stated that he was the one who executed “all” Hoffenberg’s\ninstructions to buy and sell the stock. He called it “making the orders.” He could not recall\nwhether he had chosen the brokers used.\nTo win approval from the Illinois insurance regulators for Towers’s acquisition of the\ncompanies, Hoffenberg promised to inject $3 million of new capital into them. In fact, in his\ngrand-jury testimony Hoffenberg claimed that he, his chief operating officer, Mitchell Brater,\nand Epstein came up with a scheme to steal $3 million of the insurance companies’ bonds to buy\nPan Am and Emery stock. “Jeffrey Epstein and Mitch Brater arranged the various brokerage\naccounts for the bonds to be placed with in New York, and I think one in Chicago, Rodman &\nRenshaw,” Hoffenberg reportedly said. Then, said Hoffenberg, while making it appear as though\nthey were investing the bonds in much safer financial instruments, they used them as collateral to\nbuy the stock. “Epstein was the person in charge of the transactions, and Mitchell Brater was\nassisting him with it in coordination on behalf of the insurance companies’ money,” Hoffenberg\nclaimed at the time.\nAt one point, according to Hoffenberg, a broker forged the documents necessary for a $1.8\nmillion check to be written on insurance-company funds. The check was used to buy more stock\nin the takeover targets. Meanwhile, in order to throw the insurance regulators off, the $1.8\nmillion was reported as being safely invested in a money-market account.\nUnited Fire’s former chief financial officer Daniel Payton confirms part of Hoffenberg’s\naccount. He says he recalls making one or two telephone calls to Epstein (at Hoffenberg’s\ndirection) about the missing bonds. “He said, ‘Oh, yeah, they still exist.’ But we found out later\nthat he had sold those assets … leveraged them … [and] used some margin account to take some\npositions in … Emery and Pan Am,” says Payton.\nEpstein’s extraordinary creativity was, according to Hoffenberg, responsible for the purchase by\nthe insurance companies of a $500,000 bond, with no money down. “Epstein created a great\nscheme to purchase a $500,000 treasury bond that would not be shown … [as] margined or\ncollateralized,” he reportedly told the grand jury. “It looked like it was free and clear but it\nactually wasn’t,” he said.\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 12 of 16\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303\nEpstein has denied he ever had any dealings with anyone from the insurance companies. But\nRichard Allen says he recalls talking to Epstein at Hoffenberg’s direction and telling him it was\nurgent they retrieve the missing bonds for a state examination. According to Allen, Epstein said,\n“We’ll get them back.” He had “kind of a flippant attitude,” says Allen. “They never came\nback.”\nEpstein, according to Hoffenberg, also came up with a scheme to manipulate the price of Emery\nFreight stock in an attempt to minimize the losses that occurred when Hoffenberg’s bid went\nwrong and the share price began to fall. This was alleged to have involved multiple clients’\naccounts controlled by Epstein.\nEventually, in 1991, insurance regulators in Illinois sued Hoffenberg. He settled the case, and\nEpstein, who was only a paid consultant, was never deposed or accused of any wrongdoing.\nBarry Gross, the attorney who was handling the suit for the regulators, says of Epstein, “He was\nvery elusive…. It was hard to really track him down. There were a substantial number of checks\nfor significant dollars that were paid to him, I remember…. He was this character we never got a\nhandle on. Again we presumed that he was involved with the Pan Am and Emery run that\nHoffenberg made, but we never got a chance to depose him.”\n“From the government’s discovery in the main sentencing against Hoffenberg it would seem the\ngovernment was perhaps a bit lazy,” says David Lewis, who represented Mitchell Brater. “They\nwent for what they knew they could get … and that was the fraudulent promissory notes [i.e., the\nmuch larger and unrelated part of Hoffenberg’s fraud, based in New York State]…. What they\ncouldn’t get, they didn’t bother with.”\nAnother lawyer involved in the criminal prosecution of Hoffenberg says, “In a criminal\ninvestigation like that, when there is a guilty plea, to be quick and dirty about it, discovery is\nalways incomplete…. They don’t have to line up witnesses; they don’t have to learn every fact\nthat might come out on cross-examination.”\nEpstein was involved with Hoffenberg in other questionable transactions. Financial records show\nthat in 1988 Epstein invested $1.6 million in Riddell Sports Inc., a company that manufactures\nfootball helmets. Among his co-investors were the theater mogul Robert Nederlander and\nattorney Leonard Toboroff. A source close to this transaction claims that Epstein told\nNederlander and Toboroff that he had raised his share of the money from a Swiss banker, whose\nidentity they could not be allowed to know. But Hoffenberg has claimed the money came from\nhim, and Towers’s financial statements for that year show a loan to Epstein of $400,000.\n(Epstein has said he can’t remember the details and has disputed the accuracy of the Towers\nfinancial reports.)\nAround the same time, Nederlander and Toboroff let Epstein come in with them on a scheme to\nmake money out of Pennwalt, a Pennsylvania chemical company. The plan was to group together\nwith two other parties to take a substantial declared position in the stock. According to a source,\nEpstein was supposed to help Nederlander and Toboroff raise $15 million. He seemed to fail to\nfind other investors, say those familiar with the deal. (Epstein has said he was merely an\ninvestor.) He invested $1 million, which he told his co-investors was his own money. But in his\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 13 of 16\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303\n1989 deposition he said that he put in only $300,000 of his own money. Where did the rest come\nfrom? Hoffenberg has said it came from him, in a loan that Nederlander and Toboroff didn’t\nknow about.\nTwo things happened that alarmed Nederlander and Toboroff. After the group signaled a\npossible takeover, the Pennwalt management threatened to sue the would-be raiders. Epstein was\nreluctant initially to give a deposition about his share of the money, telling Toboroff there were\n“reasons” he didn’t want to. Then, after the opportunity for new investors was closed, coinvestors\nrecall Epstein announcing that he’d found one at last: Dick Snyder, then C.E.O. of the\npublisher Simon & Schuster, who wanted to put up approximately $500,000. (Neither Epstein\nnor Snyder can now recall the investment. Yet in the 1989 deposition Epstein said that he had\nrecruited Snyder, whom he had met socially, into the deal.)\nAccording to a source, Toboroff and Nederlander told Epstein that Snyder was too late, but,\nwithout their realizing it, Hoffenberg has claimed, Snyder wrote a check to Hoffenberg and\nbought out some of his investment. But then Snyder wanted out.\n“Nederlander started to get these irate calls from [Snyder,] who wasn’t part of the deal, saying he\nwas owed all this money,” says someone close to the deal. Toboroff and Nederlander were\nbaffled.\nEventually, a source close to Hoffenberg says, Hoffenberg paid Snyder off.\nJust as Nederlander and Toboroff were growing wary of Epstein, he became increasingly\ninvolved with Leslie Wexner, whom he had met through insurance executive Robert Meister and\nhis late wife. Epstein has told people that he met Wexner in 1986 in Palm Beach, and that he\nwon his confidence by persuading him not to invest in the stock market, just as the 1987 crash\nwas approaching. His story has subsequently changed. When asked if Wexner knew about his\nconnection to Hoffenberg, Epstein said that he began working for Wexner in 1989, and that “it\nwas certainly not the same time.”\nWherever and whenever it was that Epstein and Wexner actually met, there was an immediate\nand strong personal chemistry. Wexner says he thinks Epstein is “very smart with a combination\nof excellent judgment and unusually high standards. Also, he is always a most loyal friend.”\nSources say Epstein proved that he could be useful to Wexner as well, with “fresh” ideas about\ninvestments. “Wexner had a couple of bad investments, and Jeffrey cleaned those up right\naway,” says a former associate of Epstein’s.\nBefore he signed on with Wexner, Epstein had several meetings with Harold Levin, then head of\nWexner Investments, in which he enunciated ideas about currencies that Levin found\nincomprehensible. “In fact,” says someone who used to work very closely with Wexner, “almost\neveryone at the Limited wondered who Epstein was; he literally came out of nowhere.”\n“Everyone was mystified as to what his appeal was,” says Robert Morosky, a former vicechairman\nof the Limited.\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 14 of 16\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303\nMuch of Epstein’s work is related to cleaning up, tightening budgets, and efficiencies. One\nperson who worked for Wexner and who saw a contract drawn up between the two men says\nEpstein is involved in “everything, not just a little here, a little there. Everything!” In addition, he\nsays, “Wexner likes having a hatchet man…. Whenever there is dirty work to be done he’d stick\nJeffrey on it…. He has a reputation for being ruthless but he gets the job done.”\nEpstein has evidently been asked to fire personal-staff members when needed. “He was that\nmysterious person that everyone was scared to death of,” says a former employee.\nMeanwhile, he is also less than popular with some people outside Wexner’s company with\nwhom he now deals. “He ‘inserted’ himself into the construction process of Leslie Wexner’s\nyacht…. That resulted in litigation down the road between Mr. Wexner and the shipyard that\neventually built the vessel,” says Lars Forsberg, a lawyer whose firm at the time, Dickerson and\nReily, was hired to deal with litigation stemming from the construction of Wexner’s Limitless—\nat 315 feet, one of the largest private yachts in the world. Evidently, Epstein stalled on paying\nDickerson and Reily for its work. “It’s probably once or twice in my legal career that I’ve had to\nsue a client for payment of services that he’d requested and we’d performed … without issue on\nthe performance,” says Forsberg. In the end the matter was settled, but Epstein claims he now\nhas no recollection of it.\nThe incident is one of a number of disputes Epstein has become embroiled in. Some are for sums\nso tiny as to be baffling; for instance, Epstein sued investment adviser Herbert Glass, who sold\nhim the Palm Beach house in 1990, for $13,444—Epstein claimed this was owed him for\nfurnishings removed by Glass.\nIn 1998 the U.S. Attorney’s Office sued Epstein for illegally subletting the former home of the\ndeputy consul general of Iran to attorney Ivan Fisher and others. Epstein paid $15,000 a month in\nrent to the State Department, but he charged Fisher and his colleagues $20,000. Though the exact\nterms of the agreement are sealed, the court ruled against Epstein.\nWexner offers some insight into his friend’s combative style. “Many times people confuse\nwinning and losing,” Wexner says. “Jeffrey has the unusual quality of knowing when he is\nwinning. Whether in conversations or negotiations, he always stands back and lets the other\nperson determine the style and manner of the conversation or negotiation. And then he responds\nin their style. Jeffrey sees it in chivalrous terms. He does not pick a fight, but if there is a fight,\nhe will let you choose your weapon.”\nOne case is rather more serious. Currently, Citibank is suing Epstein for defaulting on loans from\nits private-banking arm for $20 million. Epstein claims that Citibank “fraudulently induced” him\ninto borrowing the money for investments. Citibank disputes this charge.\nThe legal papers for another case offer a rare window into Epstein’s finances. In 1995, Epstein\nstopped paying rent to his landlord, the nonprofit Municipal Arts Society, for his office in the\nVillard House. He claimed that they were breaking the terms of the lease by not letting his staff\nin at night. The case was eventually settled. However, one of the papers filed in this dispute is\nEpstein’s financial statement for 1988, in which he claimed to be worth $20 million. He listed\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 15 of 16\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303\nthat he owned $7 million in securities, $1 million in cash, zero in residential property (although\nhe told sources that he had already bought the home in Palm Beach), and $11 million in other\nassets, including his investment in Riddell. A co-investor in Riddell says: “The company had\nbeen bought with a huge amount of debt, and it wasn’t public, so it was meaningless to attach a\nfigure like that to it … the price it cost was about $1.2 million.” The co-investors bought out\nEpstein’s share in Riddell in 1995 for approximately $3 million. At that time, when Epstein was\nasked, as a routine matter, to sign a paper guaranteeing he had access to a few million dollars in\ncase of any subsequent disputes over the sale price, Wexner signed for him. Epstein has\nexplained that this was because the co-investors wanted an indemnity against being sued by\nWexner. One of the investors calls this “bullshit.”\nEpstein’s appointment to the board of New York’s Rockefeller University in 2000 brought him\ninto greater social prominence. Boasting such social names as Nancy Kissinger, Brooke Astor,\nand Robert Bass, the board also includes such pre-eminent scientists as Nobel laureate Joseph\nGoldstein. “Epstein was thrilled to be elected,” says someone who knows him.\nAfter one term Epstein resigned. According to New York magazine, this was because he didn’t\nlike to wear a suit to meetings. A spokesperson for the Rockefeller board says Epstein left\nbecause he had insufficient time to commit; a board member recalls that he was “arrogant” and\n“not a good fit.” The spokesperson admits that it is “infrequent” for board members not to be\nrenominated after only one term.\nStill, the recent spate of publicity Epstein has inspired does not seem to have fazed him. In\nNovember he was spotted in the front row of the Victoria’s Secret fashion show at New York’s\nLexington Avenue Armory; around the same time the usual coterie of friends and beautiful\nwomen were whisked off to Little St. James (which he tells people has been renamed Little St.\nJeff) for a long weekend.\nThanks to Epstein’s introductions, says Martin Nowak, the biologist finds himself moving from\nPrinceton to Harvard, where he is assuming the joint position of professor of mathematics and\nprofessor of biology. Epstein has pledged at least $25 million to Harvard to create the Epstein\nProgram for Mathematical Biology and Evolutionary Dynamics, and Epstein will have an office\nat the university. The program will be dedicated to searching for nature’s algorithms, a pursuit\nthat is a specialty of Nowak’s. For Epstein this must be the summit of everything he has worked\ntoward: he has been seen proudly displaying Harvard president Larry Summers’s letter of\ncommitment as if he can’t quite believe it is real. He says he was reluctant to have his name\nattached to the program, but Summers persuaded him. He rang his mentor Wexner about it, and\nWexner told him it was all right.\nAn insatiable, restless soul, always on the move, Epstein builds a tremendous amount of\ndowntime into his hectic work schedule. Yet there is something almost programmed about his\nrelaxation: it’s as if even pleasure has to be measured in terms of self-improvement. Nowak says\nthat, when he goes to stay with Epstein in the Caribbean, they’ll get up at six and, as the sun\nrises, have three-hour conversations about theoretical physics. “Then he’ll go off and do some\nwork, re-appear, and we’ll talk some more.”\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 16 of 16\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303\nAnother person who went to the island with Epstein, Maxwell, and several beautiful women\nremembers that the women “sat around one night teasing him about the kinds of grasping women\nwho might want to date him. He was amused by the idea…. He’s like a king in his own world.”\nMany people comment there is something innocent, almost childlike about Jeffrey Epstein. They\nsee this as refreshing, given the sophistication of his surroundings. Alan Dershowitz says that, as\nhe was getting to know Epstein, his wife asked him if he would still be close to him if Epstein\nsuddenly filed for bankruptcy. Dershowitz says he replied, “Absolutely. I would be as interested\nin him as a friend if we had hamburgers on the boardwalk in Coney Island and talked about his\nideas.”\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It left 26 people dead, and nearly 80 injured\nfrom nails and shrapnel packed into the explosive charge. The second was near\nAshkelon. The bomber, dressed in Israeli uniform, joined a group of young soldiers\nand blew himself up, killing one of them. A week later, a third suicide attack\nblasted the roof off a bus on the same Jerusalem commuter route, leaving 19 more\ndead. And on March 4, a 24-year-old Palestinian walked up to the entrance of Tel\nAviv’s busiest shopping center, on Dizengoff Street, detonated 30 pounds of\nexplosives, and killed 13 people. At the bomb scenes, bloodied survivors and\ncrowds of pedestrians surveyed a hellscape of twisted metal, shards of glass and\nmangled body parts. While most Israelis were too shaken to worry about the\nimmediate political repercussions — and Bibi was careful, at least in the immediate\naftermath, not to try to score political points —Peres’s reelection campaign seemed\nto lie in tatters almost before it had begun.\n\nThe attacks were not a surprise. As I’d argued to the Washington think-tank\naudience before joining the government, the peace promise of Oslo had been\nassailed from the start by a new alliance of Islamist Palestinian violence: mainly\nHamas, and Islamic Jihad on the West Bank. They saw Arafat as a traitor who had\nsold out to Israel. For them, the issue wasn’t just Israel’s capture of the West Bank\nand Gaza in the 1967 war. It was 1948: they opposed any Jewish state, anywhere in\nPalestine. In a campaign of terror that made the first weeks of the intifada seem\nalmost easy to deal with, they began sending self-styled holy warriors to murder\nIsraeli civilians, and sacrifice their own lives, in the expectation of Allah’s rewards\nin the world to come.

Fed. 2d 789\n\nplaintiffs’ favor.” Daventree v. Republic of Azerbaijan,\n349 F.Supp.2d 736, 760 (S.D.N.Y.2004).\n\nThe alternative basis for personal jurisdiction offered by\nPlaintiffs is found in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k).\nRule 4(k)(1) provides that service of process establishes\npersonal jurisdiction when service is authorized by a\nfederal statute. Here, the ATA provides for personal\njurisdiction through its nationwide service of process\nprovision. See 18 U.S.C. § 2334(a); Fed.R.Civ.P.\n4(k)(1)(D). In situations in which Defendants were not\nserved in the United States pursuant to the ATA, Rule\n4(k)(2) acts as a personal jurisdiction gap-filler “in the\nenforcement of federal law.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(kK)(2)\nadvisory committee’s note. For the Court to exercise\npersonal jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 4(k)(2), “there must\nbe a federal claim, personal jurisdiction must not exist\nover the defendant in New York or any other state, and\nthe defendant must have sufficient minimum contacts\nwith the United States as a whole such that the exercise of\njurisdiction does not violate Fifth Amendment due\nprocess.” Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 807 (citing\nUnited States v. Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters, 945 F.Supp. 609,\n617 (S.D.N.Y.1996)).\n\n71 Under either basis offered by Plaintiffs, the exercise of\npersonal jurisdiction must comport with due process\nrequirements—there must be minimum contacts and the\nexercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable. Metro. Life\nIns. Co. v. Robertson—Ceco Corp., 84 F.3d 560, 567 (2d\nCir.1996); see also Terrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at\n810-11 (reviewing due process requirements); Ungar v.\nPalestinian Auth., 153 F.Supp.2d 76, 87 (D.R.1.2001)\n(requiring minimum contacts with the United States for\npersonal jurisdiction under *558 ATA). If personal\njurisdiction is based on New York’s long-arm statute, the\nFourteenth Amendment’s due process standards apply. If\njurisdiction is based on Rule 4(k), the Fifth Amendment\napplies. The analysis is essentially the same. “The\nprincipal difference is that under the Fifth Amendment the\ncourt can consider the defendant’s contacts throughout the\nUnited States, while under the Fourteenth Amendment\nonly contacts with the forum state may be considered.”\nChew v. Dietrich, 143 F.3d 24, 28 n. 4 (2d Cir.1998).\n\nPlaintiffs claim that Rule 4(k)’s minimum contacts\nrequirement is satisfied because the Defendants have\npurposefully directed their activities at the United States.\nSee Terrorist Attacks 1, 349 F.Supp.2d at 807 (reviewing\nthe purposefully directed activities theory). This Court has\nheld that to succeed on this theory, “Plaintiffs must make\na prima facie showing of each Defendant’s personal or\ndirect participation in the conduct giving rise to Plaintiffs’\ninjuries.” Jd. at 809.° The Court does not require direct\n\nWESTLAW\n\nparticipation in the attacks themselves, but at least\nparticipation im al Qaeda’s terrorist agenda.\n\n181 Tn analyzing a defendant’s minimum contacts, courts\ndistinguish between specific and general jurisdiction.\n“Specific jurisdiction exists when the forum exercises\njurisdiction over the defendant in a suit arising out of the\ndefendant’s contacts with that forum.” Terrorist Attacks I,\n349 F.Supp.2d at 811 (citing Metro. Life Ins. 84 F.3d at\n567-68). General jurisdiction is based on a defendant’s\ngeneral business contacts with the forum. Because the\ndefendant’s contacts are not related to the suit, a\nconsiderably higher level of contacts is generally required\nand the plaintiff must demonstrate the defendant’s\ncontinuous and systematic general business contacts with\nthe forum. Metro. Life. Ins., 84 F.3d at 568; see also\nHelicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A., 466 U.S.\n408, 414-16, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L-Ed.2d 404 (1984).\n\nIn most instances, Plaintiffs do not specify which basis for\npersonal jurisdiction applies to each Defendant, or\nwhether the Defendant was served in the United States\npursuant to the ATA’s nationwide service of process\nprovision. Accordingly, in analyzing Defendants’\nmotions, the Court considers as a threshold matter\nwhether Plaintiffs have made a prima facie showing of the\nDefendant’s minimum contacts with the United States as\na whole.\n\nA. Prince Salman and Prince Naif\nPlaintiffs seek to hold Prince Salman responsible for the\nattacks of September 11, theorizing that Prince Salman\npurposefully directed his activities at the United *559\nStates by contributing to and raising funds for HIRO,\nSanabel-al Kheer, WAMY, and Al-Haramain. As for\nother contacts with the United States, Prince Salman owns\nstock in two United States corporations based in Texas,\nand, during a trip to the United States in 1989, he met\nwith President George H.W.

In 2018, 1933 delivered ~$12.6 mm in overall revenues, with\na gross margin of 49%.

Canopy Growth is a leader in global cannabis,\nwith exposure to over a dozen countries spanning five continents. As the market share\nleader in the nascent adult use market in Canada, WEED generated sales of $83 mm in\nits most recent quarter. In addition, WEED was the first Canadian licensed producer to\npartner with a major consumer packaged goods company. In October 2017, they\nannounced the initial relationship with Constellation Brands, which was meaningfully\nexpanded with a $4 bn investment announced in August 2018. The company has\nannounced its intention to invest $100-5150 mm in New York State (where STZ is\nheadquartered), to construct a hemp industrial park focused on extraction and product\nmanufacturing. More recently, management has noted a willingness to invest as much\nas $500 mm against U.S. CBD with the expectation that this infrastructure could\nultimately be converted to capitalize on a U.S. adult use opportunity, when it\nmaterializes.\n\nCharlotte’s Web.

Despite being well distributed, 55%\nof 9M18 revenue has been derived from the company’s direct to consumer e-commerce\nmodel. Going forward, Charlotte’s Web will continue to drive innovation and will look to\nimprove their liquid delivery system to enhance efficacy, convenience and frequency of\nuse. What is more, they will offer botanical blends to target consumer need states (sleep\nand cognitive function), upgrade bioavailability technology and focus on additional\nisolated cannabinoid products. To drive sustained growth, the company will look to build\nbrand awareness through media events and social platforms, among others and\nintroduce new, differentiated botanical products in the form of tinctures, capsules,\npowders, sports performance, topicals, cosmetics, beverages and pet products.\nCharlotte’s Web will selectively pursue M&A to complement their current strengths and\nwill also look to expand internationally, with a near term focus on the EU, South America\nand Asia.

BIRMINGHAM and JAMES M. BANDOBLU, JR.\nBrad A. Birmingham is a tax partner practicing in the Buffalo, New York, office of the\nlaw firm Hodgson Russ LLP. James M Bandoblu, Jr. is a tax associate in the same\noffice.\nAs practitioners regularly use disregarded entities (DREs) in estate, corporate, and tax planning,\nit is very important that they consider during the course of planning the growing number of\ninstances in which DREs are considered to exist, in whole or in part, for tax purposes.\nVarious provisions of the Code and regulations confer “disregarded” status on an entity. This\narticle briefly describes the four most common forms of DREs and their origins and outlines some\nof the more significant—but often overlooked—exceptions and modifications to the general rule\nthat DREs are treated as “tax nothings.” Because the forms of DREs originate in different\nstatutory and regulatory provisions, some of the exceptions and modifications are specific to only\ncertain forms of DREs, others apply to all forms of DREs, and some are unique to grantor trusts.\nPractitioners should be attentive to this growing class of exceptions and modifications when tax\nplanning for their clients.\nTypes of Disregarded Entities\nThe discussion below gives a general overview of four of the more frequently used types of DREs\nand their legislative creation, but there are also other miscellaneous DREs that arise primarily\nthrough the combined use of one DRE. For example, a partnership between a taxpayer and a\nDRE that is wholly-owned by the taxpayer does not constitute a partnership for federal tax\npurposes; rather, the partnership is a DRE, absent an election (under the check-the-box\nregulations discussed below) to be treated as a corporation. 1\nGrantor Trust Rules.\nThe oldest form of a disregarded entity is the grantor trust. While the development of the\ngrantor trust rules began in the early 1900s, Congress did not issue statutory guidance until\n1954. That statutory guidance developed into what is commonly known today as the grantor\ntrust rules, which are found in Subpart E of Subchapter J of the Code. 2\nIn short, the primary result of the grantor trust rules is to tax the grantor of a trust on the trust's\nincome if the grantor retains dominion and control over the trust (or a portion of it). 3 In doing\nso, the grantor trust rules treat the grantor of a trust as the “owner” of the trust (or relevant\nportion thereof) for income tax purposes. 4 As a result, in calculating his or her taxable income,\nthe grantor includes the applicable portion of the trust's income, deductions, and credits. 5\nUnlike the check-the-box rules, there are conflicting views regarding the treatment of a grantor\ntrust as a DRE. While the plain language of the Code's grantor trust rules appears to imply that a\nwholly grantor trust (i.e., a trust that is deemed to be entirely owned by a single individual or\nentity) will be disregarded for federal income tax purposes and the IRS has treated grantor trusts\nas DREs, at least one court has not interpreted the rules in that manner. 6 Given the varying\nviews on the topic, each practitioner needs to determine whether his or her particular grantor\ntrust may be treated as a DRE. This article assumes that the grantor trust rules treat applicable\ngrantor trusts as DREs, and will survey the exceptions and modifications that apply given such\nassumption.\nCheck-the-Box Rules.\nPrior to 1997, the federal tax classification of an unincorporated business entity was determined\nunder what were known as the “Kintner Regulations,” which analyzed four characteristics of the\nentity to determine whether it more closely resembled a corporation or a partnership. 7 In 1997,\nthe Treasury Department showed sympathy for practitioners when it simplified the classification\nof unincorporated business entities by promulgating Regs. 301.7701-1, -2, and -3, now\nuniversally known as the “check-the-box” regulations. 8\nA business entity that is not automatically classified as a corporation (a “per se corporation”)\npursuant to the check-the-box regulations (an “eligible entity”) may generally elect its\nclassification for federal tax purposes. 9 The default classification for a domestic eligible entity is:\n(1) A partnership if the entity has two or more members.\n(2) “Disregarded as an entity separate from its owner” if it has a single owner. 10\nThe default classification for a foreign eligible entity is:\n(1) A partnership if it has two or more members and at least one member does not have\nlimited liability.\n(2) A corporation if all members have limited liability.\n(3) A DRE if it has a single owner that does not have limited liability. 11\nA member of a foreign eligible entity has limited liability if the member has no personal liability\nfor the debts or claims against the entity by reason of being a member. 12\nAlthough a single-member eligible entity, such as a domestic limited liability company (LLC) with\na single owner (SMLLC), is automatically treated as “disregarded as an entity separate from its\nowner,” it may elect on Form 8832 to be taxed as a corporation. 13 If an SMLLC does not elect to\nbe treated as a corporation, the check-the-box regulations treat its activities “in the same\nmanner as a sole proprietorship, branch, or division of the owner.” 14 Thus, except where an\nexception or modification exists, a non-electing SMLLC is generally ignored for federal tax\npurposes.\nQualified Subchapter S Subsidiary Rules.\nA very common form of DRE is the qualified Subchapter S corporation (QSub). Any domestic\ncorporation that is eligible to be a Subchapter S corporation and that is wholly owned by a\nSubchapter S corporation will be treated as a QSub if its parent corporation so elects. 15 The\nQSub election is made on Form 8869. When the QSub election is made, the subsidiary is\ngenerally deemed to have liquidated into the S corporation parent. 16\nIn general, a QSub is not treated as a separate corporation for federal tax purposes. 17 All of the\nQSub's assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit are treated as assets,\nliabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit of the Subchapter S corporation parent. 18\nAs discussed below, however, there are certain regulatory exceptions to the general rule that a\nQSub is not treated as a separate corporation for federal tax purposes.\nQualified REIT Subsidiary Rules.\nA qualified real estate investment trust subsidiary (QRS) is a relatively specialized form of\ndisregarded entity. A real estate investment trust (REIT) is an electing domestic corporation (or\ntrust or other association taxable as a corporation) that meets various organizational\nrequirements, derives most of its income from passive real property sources, distributes most of\nits income to its owners, and holds mainly real estate. 19 REITs generally receive conduit income\ntax treatment for income distributed to their owners. 20\nA QRS is a corporation (or trust or other association taxable as a corporation) which is wholly\nowned by a REIT and does not elect with its owner to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. 21\nA QRS is not treated as a separate corporation, and, like a QSub, its assets, liabilities, and items\nof income, deductions, and credit are treated as those of the REIT owner. 22 Thus, the corporate\nstatus of a QRS is generally ignored for federal tax purposes. As with QSubs, however, there are\ncertain regulatory exceptions to the general rule that a QRS is disregarded for federal tax\npurposes.\nGeneral Exceptions and Modifications\nThe number of exceptions and modifications to the general rule that DREs are treated as \"tax\nnothings\" has quietly increased over the last decade. A survey of some of the more prevalent\nexceptions and modifications to the general rule follows.\nEmployment and Excise Taxes.\nShortly after the check-the-box regulations and the QSub rules were issued in the late 1990s,\nthe IRS issued Notice 99-6. 23 This Notice announced the IRS's intention to issue guidance on the\nproper method for DREs to report employment taxes. It also sought public comment on the\nissue. Notice 99-6 set forth two methods for reporting and paying employment tax for DREs until\nthe IRS issued its guidance. The temporary guidance said that the IRS would accept reporting\nand payment of employment taxes with respect to SMLLC or QSub employees if either of the\nfollowing occurred:\n(1) The owner calculated, reported, and paid all employment tax obligations with respect\nto the DRE's employees under its own name and taxpayer identification number.\n(2) The DRE separately calculated, reported, and paid all employment tax obligations\nwith respect to its employees under the owner's own name and taxpayer identification\nnumber. 24\nDespite allowing a DRE to separately calculate, report, and pay employment tax obligations with\nrespect to its employees, Notice 99-6 said that the owner would, nonetheless, retain ultimate\nresponsibility for the employment tax obligations incurred with respect to the DRE's employees.\nAfter almost six years, the IRS issued proposed regulations governing the treatment of DREs for\nemployment tax and related reporting purposes. 25 In August 2007, the IRS finalized the\nproposed regulations with a few minor modifications. 26 Reg. 301.7701-2(c)(2)(iv) treats eligible\nsingle-owner DREs (e.g., SMLLCs) as corporations for employment tax purposes. 27 Thus, the\nentity now must use its own taxpayer identification number when it files and pays employment\ntaxes. 28 An individual owner of a DRE, however, is subject to self-employment tax and is not\ntreated as an employee of the disregarded entity for employment tax purposes. 29 This special\nemployment tax provision is applicable with respect to wages paid on or after 1/1/09. 30 The IRS\nalso recently updated its Employer Tax Guide to reflect the final regulations. 31\nIn addition, the IRS issued a similar provision with respect to certain excise tax reporting,\nregistration, and payment obligations. 32 That provision treats an eligible single-owner DRE as a\nseparate entity for certain excise tax purposes. 33 This special excise tax rule applies to liabilities\nimposed and actions first required or permitted in periods beginning on or after 1/1/08. 34\nThe IRS also issued a final regulation under Section 1361 that mirrors the employment and\nexcise tax regulation provisions promulgated under Section 7701. 35 Like the check-the-box\nregulations' rules, the QSub regulation treats a QSub as a corporation for employment and\nexcise tax purposes only. 36 The regulation relating to employment taxes applies with respect to\nwages paid on or after 1/1/09, but the excise tax provision applies to liabilities imposed and\nactions first required or permitted in periods beginning on or after 1/1/08. 37 The IRS probably\ndid not need to issue separate provisions under Section 1361 because Regs. 301.7701-\n2(c)(2)(iv) and (v) appear to cover QSubs as well as SMLLCs. The IRS did not issue special\nprovisions with respect to REITs, but Regs. 301.7701-2(c)(2)(iv) and (v) should also cover\nREITs. There is no authority explicitly extending these rules to grantor trusts.\nTax Liability Considerations\nA DRE, including an SMLLC, a QSub, and a QRS, is treated as a separate entity for purposes of:\n(1) Federal tax liabilities of the entity for any tax period for which the entity was not\ndisregarded,\n(2) Federal tax liabilities of any other entity for which the entity is liable.\n(3) Federal tax refunds or credits. 38\nThe regulations setting forth these exceptions apply after 3/31/04. 39 The following examples\nillustrate these exceptions to the general rule that DREs are treated as tax nothings.\nIf a domestic corporation merges (pursuant to a state law merger) into a domestic SMLLC owned\nby an individual, the SMLLC is the successor to the corporation, for state law purposes, and is\nliable for all of the corporation's debts. If the IRS sought to extend the statute of limitations on\nassessment with respect to a liability of the corporation for a tax year prior to the tax year in\nwhich the merger occurred, the SMLLC is liable for the corporation's taxes that remain unpaid,\nand, therefore, is the proper party to sign the consent to extend the period of limitations. 40 The\nresult would be the same if the SMLLC was a QSub or a QRS. 41\nUsing this example, assume that for a tax year ending before the merger occurred the IRS\ndetermines that the corporation miscalculated and underreported its income tax liability. Because\nthe SMLLC is the successor to the corporation and is liable for the underpayment of the\ncorporation's taxes, the IRS may assess the deficiency directly against the SMLLC. 42 In the event\nthat the SMLLC fails to pay the liability after notice and demand, the IRS can file a federal tax\nlien against all of the SMLLC's property and its rights to property. 43\nWith respect to QSubs and QRSs, their owners are not liable for deficiencies relating to a tax\nyear that precedes the year in which the QSub or QRS election is made, because the tax liability\nis for a tax year for which the QSub or QRS was not disregarded. 44 As a result, the IRS may\nassess the liability only against the QSub or QRS and, in the event of a failure to pay the liability\nafter notice and demand, may file a federal tax lien only against the QSub's or QRS's property\nand rights to property. 45\nAnother instance in which a DRE is recognized for federal tax purposes arises when the IRS is\nseeking to collect a tax liability from the sole member of a SMLLC. In CCA 199930013, the IRS\nChief Counsel advised that the IRS could not levy on an LLC's assets, because under state law\nthe sole member of the LLC did not own the property of the LLC. The Chief Counsel stated that\nthe mere fact that an LLC is disregarded as an entity separate from its sole member (the\ntaxpayer in that case) for federal tax purposes does not entitle the IRS to disregard the LLC for\ncollection purposes. 46 The Chief Counsel added that state law determines a taxpayer's property\ninterests for purposes of tax collection, 47 but the IRS could levy on the taxpayer's distributive\ninterest in the LLC and sell that interest or file suit to foreclose the federal tax lien against the\nownership interest. 48 In addition, depending on the facts of the case, the IRS might collect from\nan LLC's assets on the basis that it is the alter ego of its single-member or pursuant to a\nnominee or transferee liability theory. 49\nTEFRA Rules.\nAnother exception to the general rule arises in the context of the Code's audit rules for\npartnerships, which were enacted by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982\n(TEFRA). TEFRA radically changed the way in which the IRS audits partnerships for errors in\nreporting partnership income. 50 TEFRA's basis is found in Section 6221, which provides that “the\ntax treatment of any partnership item (and the applicability of any penalty, addition to tax, or\nadditional amount which relates to an adjustment to a partnership item) shall be determined at\nthe partnership level.”\nSection 6231(a)(1)(B) excludes “small partnerships” from the TEFRA rules by excluding from the\ndefinition of a “partnership” any partnership with ten or fewer partners, each of whom is a U.S.\nindividual, a C corporation, or an estate of a deceased partner. The small partnership exception\ndoes not apply, however, to a partnership for a tax year if any partner in the partnership during\nthat tax year is a “pass-thru partner.” 51 A pass-thru partner means a partnership, estate, trust,\nS corporation, nominee, or other similar person through whom other persons hold an interest in\nthe partnership. 52\nThe issue that arises in this context is whether a DRE that is a partner of a partnership is\ndisregarded when determining whether the small partnership exception to TEFRA applies. The\nIRS has looked at this issue on at least two different occasions and, in both cases, treated an\nSMLLC as a separate entity. That is, the IRS determined that the SMLLC—not its individual sole\nmember—was the partner in applying the small partnership exception to the TEFRA audit rules. 53\nBecause the SMLLC was treated as the partner and was a “pass-thru partner,” as defined in\nSection 6231(a)(9), the small partnership exception did not apply in either case.\nIn CCA 200250012, IRS Chief Counsel reasoned that the statutory language indicated that\nCongress intended that the small partnership exception to TEFRA would not apply whenever, as\na factual matter, ownership in the partnership is held through another person, regardless of the\nlegal classification of that person. Rev. Rul. 2004-88 reached the same result, but the IRS\nreasoned there that state law dictated the holding. The IRS based its holding on the fact that the\nsole member of the SMLLC partner was not a partner of the partnership under state law; rather,\nthe IRS found that the sole member held his partnership interest in the partnership indirectly\nthrough the SMLLC (i.e., was an indirect partner via the “pass-thru partner”).\nSharing of Partnership Liabilities under Code Section 752.\nAnother relatively recent variance from the treatment of DREs as “tax nothings” can be found in\nthe Section 752 regulations, which deal with the allocation of partner-level tax basis arising from\npartnership-level debt. Under these complex rules, partnership debt is generally allocated to the\npartner or partners, if any, that bear the ultimate “economic risk of loss” for the debt. For\nexample, where a partnership debt is guaranteed by a partner, that partner generally would be\nallocated the debt's entire associated tax basis. In determining which partner bears the economic\nrisk of loss, the rules provide a general assumption that a partner is financially able to perform\nunder any guarantee agreement irrespective of the partner's actual net worth, unless the facts\nand circumstances indicate a plan to circumvent or avoid the obligation. 54 As a result, tax\nplanners were able to insert virtually valueless DREs as guarantors of partnership debt to secure\nthe associated debt basis for use by the ultimate owners of the entities.\nFinal regulations published on 10/11/06 significantly modified this approach for all partners\nholding partnership interests through a DRE. 55 Under Reg. 1.752-2(k)(1), where a partner holds\nhis partnership interest through a DRE, the DRE's obligations are taken into account when\ndetermining the partner's economic risk of loss for the partnership-level liability only to the\nextent of the net value of the DRE as of the date on which the partnership determines the\npartner's share of partnership liabilities. 56 In the event that one or more DREs have payment\nobligations with respect to one or more liabilities of a partnership, the partnership must allocate\nthe net value of each DRE among the liabilities in a reasonable and consistent manner, taking\ninto account the relative priorities of those liabilities. 57\nThis special treatment of DREs in this context has been criticized by some commentators in that\nit uniquely singles out DREs when, in fact, any pass-through entity that limits the liability of its\nowners can be used to accomplish similar results without a similar net value limitation. 58\nNonetheless, the special treatment exists and represents another danger in simply ignoring a\nDRE as nonexistent during the course of tax planning.\nState Tax Treatment of DREs.\nDespite the fact that almost every state generally respects the federal classification of an SMLLC\nas a DRE for income tax purposes, several states impose an entity-level tax or fee on LLCs,\nincluding SMLLCs. 59 The types of taxes or fees imposed, and the SMLLCs subject to the tax, vary\nwidely from state-to-state. Practitioners should inquire into a state's entity-level tax on SMLLCs,\nand possibly other DREs, before proceeding with planning opportunities in that state.\nUnlike the general conformity with federal law classification for income tax purposes, most states\ntreat LLCs, including SMLLCs, as separate legal entities with respect to registration fees, sales\nand use taxes, employment taxes, and property taxes. As a result, LLCs are generally subject to\nliability for these taxes and fees. Additionally, most states require an SMLLC to file its own\nseparate sales and use tax return, notwithstanding the fact that for state income tax purposes\nthe SMLLC is disregarded. 60 On the other hand, many states allow an SMLLC and its owner to\nelect to file a consolidated sales and use tax return, if certain conditions are met. 61\nConsequently, practitioners should analyze a DRE's tax and filing obligations state by state, so\nthat they can fully apprise their clients of all potential taxes and fees a particular state may\nimpose.\nGrantor Trust Considerations\nAs mentioned briefly above, opinions differ as to whether a wholly grantor trust is considered a\ndisregarded entity. In Rothstein, 62 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals implicitly held that a\nwholly grantor trust was not disregarded for all income tax purposes, because the grantor\nreceived a cost basis for assets purchased from the trust. In Rev. Rul. 85-13, 1985-1 CB 184,\nhowever, the IRS reached the opposite result on facts similar to those in Rothstein. That is, the\nIRS held that the acquisition of the trust's property by the grantor in exchange for a note could\nnot be a sale because the grantor was both the maker and owner of the note. As a result, the\ngrantor did not receive a new cost basis in the stock purchased from the trust.\nThe IRS has explicitly stated that it will not follow the Second Circuit's decision in Rothstein.\nIndeed, many estate planners rely heavily on Rev. Rul. 85-13's conclusions for a variety of\nestate planning techniques involving sales to grantor trusts. Consequently, the lasting impact of\nthe Rothstein decision may prove negligible.\nEven if disregarded for federal income tax purposes, states may not disregard a wholly grantor\ntrust for certain purposes. For example, Pennsylvania varies from federal law regarding grantor\ntrusts and imposes state income tax on grantor trusts according to the same personal income\ntax rules that apply to irrevocable trusts, unless the grantor trust is a revocable trust. 63 For\nsome non-income tax purposes (e.g., sales tax), a wholly grantor trust that is disregarded for\nfederal income tax purposes may be respected as the owner of the trust's corpus by some\nstates. In New York, for instance, a sale between a grantor and his grantor trust could be subject\nto sales tax, because for sales tax purposes New York generally respects the separate existence\nof distinct legal entities, even though the distinction may be disregarded for federal and state\nincome tax purposes. 64\nForeign Tax Planning Considerations\nPractitioners should be aware that foreign countries may not treat U.S. grantor trusts as\ndisregarded entities. As noted below, a wholly grantor trust is treated as a separate entity for\nCanadian tax purposes. Various planning opportunities may arise as a result of such divergent\ntreatment.\nConduit Financing.\nTreasury has proposed respecting DREs in an attempt to combat perceived tax avoidance\nachieved through the use of multiple-party financing transactions. 65 In general, a financing\narrangement is a series of transactions in which one person advances money or other property\nor grants rights to use property and another person receives money or other property or rights\nto use property, the advance and receipt are effected through one or more other persons, and\nfinancing transactions link all of the entities. 66 Examples of a financing transaction include debt\nand any lease or license. 67\nSince 1995, regulations have allowed the IRS to ignore intermediate entities participating in a\nfinancing arrangement where the intermediate entities are acting as conduit entities and to\nrecharacterize the financing arrangement as a transaction directly between the remaining parties\nfor purposes of imposing tax under Sections 871 and 881 and withholding obligations under\nSections 1441 and 1442. 68\nIn December 2008, the IRS issued proposed regulations under Section 881. 69 Under Prop. Reg.\n1.881-3(a)(2)(i)(C), any transaction entered into by a DRE will be taken into account for\npurposes of determining whether a conduit financing arrangement exists. The proposed\nregulation accomplishes this by stating that, for purposes of the regulations under Section 881,\nthe term “person” includes a business entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its\nsingle member owner under the check-the-box regulations. 70\nCurrently, this change to the regulation remains only proposed. The proposed regulation states\nthat it is not effective until the date it is adopted as a final regulation. 71 It is interesting to note,\nhowever, that the Preamble to the proposed regulation states that the proposed regulations\n“clarify that a disregarded entity is a person for purposes of Regulation 1.881-3,” implying that\nthe IRS does not need the proposed regulation's change to effect this result. 72 Consequently,\npractitioners practicing in this area should employ caution both before and after the proposed\nregulation becomes final.\nDual Consolidated Losses.\nThe dual consolidated loss (DCL) rules are generally intended to prevent companies with tax\nresidency in two different jurisdictions from using the same losses to obtain tax benefits in both\njurisdictions. The provisions in Section 1503(d), and the consolidated return regulations that\ndisallow the use of a DCL, generally treat a DRE as a separate entity. 73 An example of a DRE to\nwhich the DCL rules may apply is the so-called “hybrid entity,” which is an entity that is\ndisregarded for U.S. tax purposes but is subject to an entity-level income tax by a foreign\ncountry. 74 The purpose of the DCL provisions, as applied to a domestic corporation that owns a\nhybrid entity, is to prevent a single net operating loss (NOL) generated by a DRE from being\nused in both the U.S. and in a foreign jurisdiction. 75\nThe DCL rules apply only to a dual resident corporation (DRC). A DRC is a domestic corporation\nor a separate unit of the domestic corporation (e.g., a hybrid entity that is a DRE for U.S. tax\npurposes) that is subject to U.S. tax on its worldwide income and a foreign jurisdiction's tax on\nits worldwide income or with respect to its separate unit's worldwide income. 76 Without the\ngeneral disallowance of the DCL to the DRC, use of the DCL could occur in both the U.S. and the\nforeign jurisdiction because the DRC could offset its own income with the NOL generated by the\nDRE for U.S. tax purposes, and that NOL might also be used for foreign tax purposes against\nincome that may not be subject to U.S. tax. 77\nIn general, the DCL rules forbid a DRC from reducing the taxable income of any other member of\nits affiliated group by the amount of the DRE's DCL unless, as provided in the regulations, the\nloss does not offset the income of any foreign corporation. 78 For purposes of determining the\nDCL, the DRE is treated as a separate entity and its income, deductions, gain, and loss are\ncomputed on a “stand alone” basis from the DRC that owns the DRE. 79 In that respect, the DRE\nis not treated as a disregarded entity.\nTreatment by Foreign Countries\nPractitioners should also be aware of the treatment of DREs by foreign countries. Canada, for\nexample, generally does not disregard U.S. SMLLCs; rather, it treats them as corporations. Also,\na grantor trust that is disregarded in the U.S. is respected as a trust in Canada. Some income\ntax treaties between the U.S. and foreign countries specifically address the treatment of\ndisregarded entities (also called “fiscally transparent” entities by some treaties).\nIn addition to some countries treating DREs differently than the U.S., the Code contains some\nprovisions that create special rules for certain DREs (or “fiscally transparent” entities). Section\n894 generally operates to deny certain treaty benefits to a “hybrid entity” (i.e., an entity treated\nas fiscally transparent for U.S. income tax purposes but recognized as a separate entity for\npurposes of the tax law of the foreign country). Under that section, income derived by a foreign\nperson through a fiscally transparent entity is denied the benefit of a reduced rate of withholding\ntax that an income tax treaty may provide if certain conditions are met. For instance, if a U.S.\ncompany makes an interest payment to an LLC that is wholly owned by a Canadian company,\nthe payment is generally subject to the full 30% withholding rate imposed by Code section\n1442(a) and is not entitled to the benefits of a reduced rate of withholding that the U.S./Canada\nincome tax treaty would otherwise permit.\nPractitioners should be cognizant of the treatment of DREs by other countries. 80 Not only can the\ndifferent treatment by a foreign country present traps for the unwary, but they can also produce\nsignificant planning opportunities for U.S. individuals and businesses.\nObama Proposal.\nThe Obama administration recently released its 2010 budget proposals, which included a\nproposal that would make a regulatory change to the check-the-box regulations requiring some\nforeign subsidiaries to be treated as separate corporations for U.S. federal tax purposes. 81 The\nproposal is designed to prohibit the shifting of income from one foreign subsidiary to another in a\ntax-haven country. 82\nUnder the proposal, a foreign eligible entity with a single owner that is organized or created in a\ncountry other than that of its single owner would be treated as a corporation for all federal tax\npurposes. 83 Existing eligible entities would undergo a deemed conversion into a corporation\nunder the proposal, resulting in the entities incurring the usual tax consequences related to a\nconversion (e.g., triggering of dual-consolidated losses). Except in cases of U.S. tax avoidance,\nthe proposal generally would not apply to a first-tier foreign eligible entity wholly owned by a\nU.S. person. 84\nIf adopted, the proposal would not take effect until 2011. 85 Given the Obama Administration's\nheightened scrutiny of offshore tax havens and international tax abuses, this proposal is one to\nmonitor closely.\nConclusion\nThere are now several instances in which DREs are not really disregarded for tax purposes. In\naddition, various proposals would increase the number of exceptions/modifications to the general\nrule that a DRE is a “tax nothing.” It is important for practitioners to keep this assortment of\ndisclaimers in mind in advising clients with respect to tax planning using DREs. The erosion of\nthe check-the-box regulations and other DRE provisions continues to be a trap for the unwary.\n1\nRev.

It quantifies the extent to which P\nis a pattern in X. Supposing that F(P) = X, then the first factor in the definition equals 1,\nand we are left with only the second term, which measures the degree of compression obtained\nvia representing X as the result of P rather than simply representing X directly. The greater\nthe compression ratio obtained via using P to represent X, the greater the intensity of P as a\npattern in X. The first time, in the case F(P) #4 X, adjusts the pattern intensity downwards to\naccount for the amount of error with which F(P) approximates 4 X. If one holds the second\nfactor fixed and thinks about varying the first factor, then: The greater the error, the lossier\nthe compression, and the lower the pattern intensity.\n\nFor instance, if one wishes one may take c to denote algorithmic information measured on\nsome reference Turing machine, and F(X) to denote what appears on the second tape of a\ntwo-tape Turing machine ¢ time-steps after placing X on its first tape. Other more naturalistic\ncomputational models are also possible here and are discussed extensively in Appendix 1 of\n[Goe06a].\n\nDefinition 2 The structure of X € M is the fuzzy set Stx defined via the membership\nfunction\nXstx(P) =e\n\nThis lets us formalize our definition of “mind” alluded to above: the mind of X as the set\nof patterns associated with X. We can formalize this, for instance, by considering P to belong\nto the mind of X if it is a pattern in some Y that includes X. There are then two numbers\nto look at: .% and P(Y|X) (the percentage of Y that is also contained in X). To define the\ndegree to which P belongs to the mind of X we can then combine these two numbers using\nsome function f that is monotone increasing in both arguments. This highlights the somewhat\narbitrary semantics of “of” in the phrase “the mind of X.” Which of the patterns binding X to\nits environment are part of X’s mind, and which are part of the world? This isn’t necessarily\na good question, and the answer seems to depend on what perspective you choose, represented\nformally in the present framework by what combination function f you choose (for instance if\nf(a,b) = a™b?” then it depends on the choice of 0 <r < 1).\n\nNext, we can formalize the notion of a “pattern space” by positing a metric on patterns, thus\nmaking pattern space a metric space, which will come in handy in some places in later chapters:\n\nDefinition 3 Assuming M is a countable space, the structural distance is a metric dst\ndefined on M via\n\ndst(X,Y) =T(xstx,Xsty)\nwhere T is the Tanimoto distance.\nThe Tanimoto distance between two real vectors A and B is defined as\n7 A-B\nAl? + (|B? -— A: B\n\nand since M is countable this can be applied to fuzzy sets such as Stx via considering the\nlatter as vectors. (As an aside, this can be generalized to uncountable M as well, but we will\nnot require this here.)\n\nT(A, B)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012970\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This is equivalent\nto 32x FY17E EPS. Strong earnings growth means out-year valuations appear much\nmore reasonable than near-term valuations (e.g. implied 13x FY20E EPS). Company\nspecific risks are: lower-than-expected growth resulting from delays in executing on\nexpansion plans, inability to raise prices to offset cost inflation, failure to manage\ngrowth without impacting margins, pricing pressure from insurers, new competition,\nsustained delays to government payments, and any potentially dilutive acquisitions.\nGeneral/macro risks are: sustained low oil prices and any resultant slow-down in the\neconomy, civil unrest, ongoing failure of the government to pay bills.\n\nAl Othaim (XWPJF)\n\nWe use a combination of DCF, DDM and peer group analysis to value Al Othaim. We\nhave taken a weighted average of values implied by our DCF, DDM and peer group\nanalyses. We attribute a 50% weight to the DCF and 25% weights for both the DDM and\nthe P/E multiple, which points to a PO of SAR121. We attribute a greater weight to the\nDCF valuation as we believe food retailers offer good visibility on cash flow generation.\nIn the case of Al Othaim, we think DCF better reflects the stock's growth opportunity.\nWe assume a perpetuity growth rate of 2% and WACC of 9.1% in our DCF.\n\nThe downside risks to our investment case are:\n\n- Weaker-than-expected margin performance\n\n- Cannibalisation effect in Saudi Arabia\n\n- Competition: We expect competition to intensify among the large organized players,\nsuch as Savola-owned Panda which have aggressive retail expansion plans growth plan\n- Saudization: Most of Al Othaim’'s labors are low level staff working in the warehouses\nand branches which depends heavily on expatriate labors. This suggests the Saudization\nof the staff could put further pressure on margins.\n\nAlmarai (XALRF)\nWe arrive at our SAR61/share price objective using a combination of P/E multiples and\nDCF valuation, taking the average yielded by the two methods.

VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential\nprice fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)\nattractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total\nreturn of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than\nBuy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12\nmonth total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be\nreferenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).\n\nInvestment rating Total retum expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*\nBuy = 10% < 10%\nNeutral 20% = 30%\nUnderperform NIA = 20%\n\n*Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.\n\nINCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays\nno cash dividend.

From a CogPrime perspective, its use has been to guide\nthe design process, to provide a grounding for what otherwise would have been fairly arbitrary\nchoices.\n\n3.4.4.1 Self\n\nAnother high-level intelligent system pattern mentioned above is the “self”, which we here will tie\nin with analysis and synthesis processes. The term “self” as used here refers to the “phenomenal\nself” [Met04] or “selfmodel”. That is, the self is the model that a system builds internally,\nreflecting the patterns observed in the (external and internal) world that directly pertain to\nthe system itself. As is well known in everyday human life, selfmodels need not be completely\naccurate to be useful; and in the presence of certain psychological factors, a more accurate\nself-model may not necessarily be advantageous. But a self-model that is too badly inaccurate\nwill lead to a badly-functioning system that is unable to effectively act toward the achievement\nof its own goals.\n\nThe value of a self-model for any intelligent system carrying out embodied agentive cognition\nis obvious. And beyond this, another primary use of the self is as a foundation for metaphors\nand analogies in various domains. Patterns recognized pertaining to the self are analogically\nextended to other entities. In some cases this leads to conceptual pathologies, such as the an-\nthropomorphization of trees, rocks and other such objects that one sees in some precivilized\ncultures. But in other cases this kind of analogy leads to robust sorts of reasoning - for instance,\nin reading Lakoff and Nunez’s [LN00] intriguing explorations of the cognitive foundations of\nmathematics, it is pretty easy to see that most of the metaphors on which they hypothesize\nmathematics to be based, are grounded in the mind’s conceptualization of itself as a spatiotem-\nporally embedded entity, which in turn is predicated on the mind’s having a conceptualization\nof itself (a self) in the first place.\n\nA self-model can in many cases form a self-fulfilling prophecy (to make an obvious double-\n\nentendre’!). Actions are generated based on one’s model of what sorts of actions one can and/or\nshould take; and the results of these actions are then incorporated into one’s self-model. If a\nself-model proves a generally bad guide to action selection, this may never be discovered, unless\nsaid self-model includes the knowledge that semi-random experimentation is often useful.\nIn what sense, then, may it be said that self is an attractor of iterated analysis? Analysis\ninfers the self from observations of system behavior. The system asks: What kind of system\nmight I be, in order to give rise to these behaviors that I observe myself carrying out? Based\non asking itself this question, it constructs a model of itself, i.e. it constructs a self. Then, this\nself guides the system’s behavior: it builds new logical relationships its self-model and various\nother entities, in order to guide its future actions oriented toward achieving its goals. Based on\nthe behaviors newly induced via this constructive, forward-synthesis activity, the system may\nthen engage in analysis again and ask: What must I be now, in order to have carried out these\nnew actions? And so on.\n\nOur hypothesis is that after repeated iterations of this sort, in infancy, finally during early\nchildhood a kind of selfreinforcing attractor occurs, and we have a selfmodel that is resilient\nand doesn’t change dramatically when new instances of action- or explanation-generation occur.\nThis is not strictly a mathematical attractor, though, because over a long period of time the self\nmay well shift significantly. But, for a mature self, many hundreds of thousands or millions of\nforward-analysis cycles may occur before the self-model is dramatically modified.

I kept\nrunning into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of\nyoung women with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. “Do they speak?” I remember\nasking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. “Not like you, Vicky,” was his riposte.\n\nI remembered that when we’d once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I\nhadn’t studied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a\npackage at home via messenger. It was a book: “Math for idiots.”\n\nSo he is not without humor, even though he doesn’t drink or smoke, and hates restaurants.\n\n“Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects,” newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He\nwas certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few\nmoments in his company and you know this to be true.\n\nWhen I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that\n“Andy”—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his\nstrange title is. Because if one thing’s for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what\nhe’s talking about far more than “Andy” does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other\nfinanciers hang out with him.\n\nAnd Ghislaine?\nFull disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It’s almost impossible not to.\n\nShe is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I’ve spent hours\ntalking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is\ncurious. She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent\nmea DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else’s I can think of—probably even\nRupert Murdochs’. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill\nClinton with whom she is close friends.\n\nYet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-\nPlatero, (known fondly to her close friends as “the Tennis Goddess”) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When\nit comes down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her\nvulnerability.\n\nAnd that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey.\n\n“He saved her,” I remember a close friend of mine telling me. “When her father died, she was a wreck;\ninconsolable. And then Jeffrey took her in. She’s never forgotten that—and never will.”\n\nIn many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect\nreplacement for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his\nsexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine’s father was not without his oddities. After all, 1t was he who died leaving\na massive “black hole” he’d fraudulently created.

(The last few times I asked, the people included the\nhead of a major testing service, the governor of a U.S. state, various\nstate legislators, and 200 high school principals.) Then why do we\nteach this obviously useless piece of information to every student in\nthe world? Because math is important, of course.\n\nWhy?\n\nAs a person who was involved with graduate admissions for 30\nyears at three of the top ten universities in the country, I know what\nthis hysteria is actually about. Nearly all applicants to graduate com-\nputer science programs (which is what I know—but it is true in most\nfields of engineering and science) are foreign nationals. We wonder\nwhy American kids aren’t interested in these fields—which is a reason-\nable enough question. But then we have come up with an extraordi-\nnary answer.\n\nWhat we say is that we must teach math and science better in high\nschool when what we mean is that it would be nice to have some more\nAmerican-born scientists.\n\nDo we really believe that the reason that there are so many foreign\napplicants to U.S. graduate programs is that they teach math and sci-\nence better in other countries? China and India provide most of the\napplicants. They also have most of the world’s people.

Almost a year\nbefore leading the first mission on the Golan, I’d actually been involved in\npreliminary planning, and fairly detailed training, for such a mission in the\nSinai. We’d ended up abandoning the idea as obviously unworkable.\n\nBut Meir Amit, not just our unit’s overall commander in the kirya but Chief\nof Operations during Rotem, recognized that getting intelligence access to\nEgypt was central to Israeli security. He was intent on reviving the plan to tap\ninto Nasser’s communications in the Sinai. So was Avraham Arnan. He enlisted\nthe backing of an old friend, Uri Yarom, who was now commander of the Israeli\nAir Force and was eager to put our fleet of recently acquired Sikorsky S-58\nhelicopters to operational use. When Avraham called me in to tell me what he\nhad in mind, he began by saying it would be “by far the greatest challenge\nwe ve contemplated” — typically disarming candor, but also a challenge which\nI’m pretty sure he knew would only increase my determination to at least try.\nThe flight in would be difficult enough. Israel had never before tried such a\nheliborne mission. But he told me that wasn’t my problem. “That will be Uri’s\njob.” The really testing part would be to carry out an mission, at night, deep\ninside Egypt, cover our tracks and get out again in one piece. “Still, I’m sure\nthat we can succeed,” he said. “And I want you and your team to do it.”\n\nEven now, more than half-a-century later, some of the details of how we\nplanned to tap into the Egyptians’ communications remain classified. But once\nI’d chosen my team of sayeret soldiers for the mission, we trained for nearly\nnine months. We drafted in geologists to identify areas of the Negev similar to\nthe terrain we’d find in the Sinai. We developed a series of methods to prevent\nEgyptian soldiers or scouts from discovering that we’d been there — assuming,\nof course, we managed to get in, attach the intercept, and return safely. It was a\nrelentless process of trial... and error.\n\nOne of the many reasons we’d abandoned the plan a couple of years earlier\nwas that, in a nighttime exercise to see whether we could avoid detection by\nIsrael’s own crack desert scouts, we'd failed utterly.

The CVRA extends the requirement for fair treatment not only to\nprosecutors and courts, but also to all \"officers and employees of the Department of Justice and other departments and agencies\nof the United States engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime ... .\". °° (I will call this the CVRA's\n\"coverage provision.\") It is, of course, easily conceivable that investigative agencies might violate a victim's right to fairness\nbefore formal criminal proceedings were initiated. Because \"no prosecution is underway\" in such circumstances, the victim\nwould need to assert their rights (in the language of the CVRA's venue provision) \"in the district court in the district in which\nthe crime occurred.\"\n\nUnder the Advisory Committee's proposal, a victim who is treated unfairly by a federal investigative agency will lack any place\nto assert her right to fair treatment - in contravention of a teaching that traces back at least to Marbury v. Madison that \"where\nthere is a legal right, there is also a legal remedy.\" >*4 The Advisory Committee, however, seems to think that this is not a\nproblem to be addressed in the Rules because the rights covered by the criminal rules \"could only be asserted with respect to a\ncase being prosecuted.\" But, of course, this assumption depends on limiting the rights in the CVRA to such narrow provisions\nas the right to be \"heard\" on sentencing and other issues, because these rights attach only to \"any public proceeding.\" >>> This\nassumption fails if the right to be treated fairly (not to mention the right to be treated with dignity and respect and other rights)\nis in the mix - as CVRA's plain language demands.\n\nThe Advisory Committee seemed to recognize the venue problem for cases with no prosecution underway when it discussed.\nthe fact that victims may now have rights in the grand jury process (a subject squarely covered by the criminal rules >°°). But\nother examples exist as well. For example, federal agents may improperly tread on a victim's rights through a search warrant\n(another subject covered by the criminal rules °°’). Or in the course of their investigation, they may mishandle evidence in a\nway that treads on a victim's dignity (improperly disseminating a nude or pornographic photograph of a victim, for instance.\n598) In [*962] all these situations, victims are at least entitled to a forum to assert their rights to be treated with fairness and\nwith respect for their dignity and privacy - yet the Advisory Committee has excised the CVRA's venue provision that provides\nthe forum.\n\n5\n\na\n\n2 Proposed Amendments, supra note 71, Rule 60(b)(4), at 17.\n\n353 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1) (emphasis added).\n\n345 U.S. (I Cranch) 137, 163 (1803).\n\n5 18 U.S.C. § 3771 (a)(4).\n36 Fed.

The mastery of each of these will\nnot be achieved by dashing success in each. So we need to cultivate a single,\nessential instinct here. Anew temprament that I’ve called The Seventh Sense. And,\nwith that done, to fight the wars, write the poems, make the civilizations to confront\nall that lies ahead. Our greatest hope in the race against the totalizing machines and\nthose who control them; our finest insurance for liberty and prosperity instead of\nmadness is not in technology. Our greatest weapon will not be our bombers our\ndrones or our financial strength. It will be in our own humanity.

At certain moments it seems\nwe're linked to something miraculous, at others to a system of really instant\nviciousness. And because we are all connected, changes in one part of the system\ninvariably redound elsewhere. An object seems miraculous one moment, violent the\nnext. This isn’t getting easier for us. We are, as we've seen, heading to an era where\nthe machines and the networks will have ever more, ever more decisive power,\nlargely because we've given it to them.

The\nredistribution of power and finance into the hands of the many demanded the\ndemolition of old structures, the ones mastered by a few. For one man to rule\nmillions with no reason other than birth made no sense anymore. The last six\ncenturies have been nothing but a tale of liberation, its price and its rewards. We are\nmore free now than we ever have been, in a sense. And, at this very same moment,\nwe are more enmeshed. Power is moving now from institutions and ideas built for\nliberty to ones built for enclosure, for connection, for speed and for the beyond-\nhuman intelligence that complexity demands. This will snap our votes, our money\nand our ideas with the same blunt efficiency the last revolution managed in Luther’s\n\n203\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018435\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I have subsequently learned that he used\nintermediaries. I asked myself, why did these guys provide this information, what was their\nmotivation? And I subsequently learned that he paid them. That the intermediaries paid the sources\nand the intermediaries got the money from Chris.”\n\nPaying ex-FSB officers for sensitive information? As Steele is no doubt aware, there is no such\nthing as an ex-FSB officer. All Russian intelligence officers, whether currently or formerly\nemployed, if in Russia, operate under the same tough security regime. The selling of secret\ninformation by them is espionage, pure and simple. Selling it to someone connected to an adversary\nintelligence service greatly compounds the crime. Sources A and B (through their intermediaries)\nknew that they were dealing with an ex-MI-6 man who could use their betrayal of secrets against\nthem. The only safe way for A and B to provide the requested dirt would be to clear it with the\nsecurity regime at the FSB. This precaution, a required step in such exchanges, would mean that the\ndirt in the dossier, whether true or false, was curated by the FSB and spoon-fed to Steele. If so, the\nFSB was the surreptitious provider of this part of the Steele dossier.\n\nThe third disclosure operation involved stolen emails from the DNC bearing on the unfair treatment\nby Democratic Party officials of Bernie Sanders, which were posted on the DC Leaks website.\nPresident Obama identified the Kremlin as the author of this operation, saying “These data theft\nand disclosure activities could only have been directed by the highest levels of the Russian\ngovernment.” If so, as in the previous cases, the FSB would have curated the dirt. To be sure, oppo-\nresearch operatives, because of their singular focus on getting usable slime, are highly vulnerable to\nshady offers, but why would Russia so blatantly feed the slime to all sides in a campaign?\n\nThe United States has a wide array of tools for monitoring Russian intelligence, including the\nworld’s most sophisticated sensors for intercepting signals, but discovering the Kremlin’s motives\nremains an elusive enterprise because, unlike in a scientific inquiry, one cannot fully trust the\nobservable data. While a scientist can safely assume that the microbes he observes through the lens\nof a microscope are not employing guile to mislead him, an intelligence analyst cannot make\nsimilar assumptions about the content of intercepted communications from Russia. If one assumes\nthat the Russians do not know that the channel is being monitored—an assumption which,\nfollowing the defection of Edward Snowden to Russia, is hard to make prudently—then the\nintelligence gleaned from that channel can reveal the Kremlin’s activities and motive. If, however,\nit is understood that the Russians know that a channel is being monitored, the information conveyed\nover it can be considered a disclosure operation.\n\nIf, for example, a Mafia family finds out that the FBI is tapping its telephone lines, it can use those\nlines to burn its rivals. The Kremlin can also use a knowntapped phone line to its advantage.\nConsider, for example, the tapped phone of Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. On December 1,\n2016, Kislyak went to Trump Tower to meet Jared Kushner and Michael Flynn. According to\nKushner’s version of that meeting, Kislyak suggested that Russian generals could supply\ninformation about Russian military operations in Syria on the condition that the Trump transition\nteam provide a “secure line in the transition office.” Of course, as Kislyak likely knew, transition\nteams don’t have secure lines to Moscow. Kushner responded by asking if the Russian embassy\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025549\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Earnings yields over 5 year swap rate are attractive currently attractive, yet the flattening of interest\ncurves has come to a halt and we see less support from it in the future.\n\ne Little supply of commercial space across the globe leads vacancy rates to gradually decline and low\ncapitalization rates in core markets support capital values. Also rental yields remain attractive compared to\nhigh grade bond yields. However, further significant capital appreciation is unlikely. This is especially due a\nslow down in rental income as economic growth is subdued. Hence, future performance is limited.\n\ne Although slightly reduced, we maintain our preference for US REITs due to stable fundamentals and like\nAustralia as a conservative play. We slightly overweight Hong Kong, stay neutral towards Singapore, but\nmaintain a slight underweight in Japan as fundamentals remain unconvincing.\n\nA Positive scenario UBS Global Index DTR (6-month target): 1,500\n¢ Improving macroeconomic data in the US, positive economic surprises in Europe followed by monetary\neasing in China help to increase growth prospects that support rental income growth, while refinancing\ncosts remain low in a low inflation environment. Real estate offers a comparatively attractive yield.\nNegative scenario UBS Global Index DTR (6-month target): 1,300\n¢ The US growth path disappoints investor expectations and causes the comparatively high valuation levels\nthere to correct, significantly affecting global real estate. Furthermore, a more severe recession in Europe\ntriggers a tightening of credit standards, making listed real estate more dependent than ever on bank\nfinancing at a time when credit markets are already fragile. Real estate underperforms global equities\nbecause the correlation between the availability of credit and short-term performance is high.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nWe do not expect capitalization rates to decrease much from now. Rental yields\nhave already been pushed down by decreasing bond yields; we see a diminishing\nsupport from the interest curve, which has significantly flattened in the past.\nGlobal commercial real estate transaction volumes are down year-on-year due to\na lack of product in core markets and constraints on debt financing. Global rental\ngrowth has softened and very modest growth will feature major markets overall.\n\nCapitalization rates and\nrental yields\n\nTransaction volumes and\nfuture rental growth in\ndirect markets\n\nCredit markets and\nfinancing costs\n\n36 UBS\n\nLending conditions have been a little tightened. However, well financed listed\ncompanies have still good access to credit, while others are more restricted.\n\nPreference: neutral\n\nRecommendations\n\nTactical (6 months)\n\n¢ We maintain our neutral stance towards\nlisted real estate after a good performance\nyear-to-date and due to a relative less\nattractive valuation compared to global\nequities. Going forward returns are limited\nby subdued revenue growth. However, we\nstill expect listed real estate to stay\ncomparatively attractive in a low growth,\nlow rates environment.\n\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\ne A cyclical slowdown in rents limits growth,\nbut attractive refinancing conditions are\nsupportive.

I am myself rather disappointed by the lack of skepticality of this community. As I said, I have read\nnumerous reports of orgies on Jeffrey’s island involving me and other scientists during our meetings.. Orgies\nthat never happened, Iam VERY skeptical of other claims on his behavior. I am defending Jeffrey for 2\nreasons: (1) Based on my knowledge and experience I am skeptical of the claims in the media and of those who\nhave settled claims for money... namely I don’t believe the published details just like I tend to be skeptical of\nmany published details on the internet.. I don’t believe Jeffrey did what has been claimed, and unless I see hard\nevidence, I will trust my own judgement here, and (2) Jeffrey went to prison, and I happen to believe that\nhaving served time, even those who questioned his behavior should be willing to give him the benefit of the\ndoubt, again until proved otherwise, that he is working hard to live a good life and do good things. I for one am\ndisgusted that people eat up the salacious nonsense the read on the web and then jump to conclusions about\nthings and people they do not know.. I do not jump to condemn people, especially when it concerns their sexual\npreferences. [DO NOT CONDONE sex with young girls, or young boys for that matter.. because there are real\nvictims there.. Until I know all the facts however, I do not jump to conclusions, and I am sorry, having seen the\nmedia frenzy around Jeffrey, and having seen the shoddy behavior of those who have attacked him, I remain\nskeptical, and I support a man whose character I believe I know..

It also is believed to have\ntherapeutic applications, such as appetite stimulation, bronchodilation, neuroprotection and pain relief.\n\nCBD (Cannabidiol: CBD is considered to be the second most abundant cannabinoid in canna-\nbis. It is nonpsychoactive and is believed to counteract the psychoactive effects of THC. CBD also is\nbelieved to have wide-ranging medicinal benefits: analgesic, antianxiety, antibacterial, anticancer, anti-\nconvulsant, antidepressant, antiemetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-insomnia, anti-ischemic, antipsychotic\nand antispasmodic. In addition, CBD is believed to have therapeutic applications, including appetite\nstimulation, bone-growth stimulation, immunosuppression and neuroprotection. CBD can be derived\nfrom many cannabis strains, including low-THC strains ordinarily grown to produce industrial hemp\nproducts.\n\nCBC (Cannabichromene: CBC is thought to be the third most abundant cannabinoid in canna-\nbis and is nonpsychoactive. Like THC and CBD, CBC is believed to have several medicinal bene-\nfits, including analgesic, antibacterial, anticancer, antidepressant, antifungal, anti-inflammatory and\nanti-insomnia. CBC is also used as a therapeutic bone-growth stimulant. Ongoing research seeks to\ndetermine the role of CBC in reducing gastrointestinal inflammation. CBC may also have applications\nin pain management—in addition to binding to the CB1 and CB2 endocannabinoid receptors, it has\nbeen shown to interact with certain pain receptors.\n\nCBG (Cannabigerol: CBG is nonpsychoactive and is believed to have several medicinal benefits—\nanalgesic, antibacterial, anticancer, antidepressant and antifungal—as well as a therapeutic application\nfor bone-growth stimulation. CBG is present primarily during the early stages of the cannabis plant’s\ngrowth cycle; only small amounts can be extracted from the plant during its flowering stage (although\nstrains of cannabis have recently been bred to have high levels of CBG). CBG is believed to partially\ncounteract the psychoactive effects of THC and to decrease anxiety and muscle tension.\n\nCBGA (Cannabigerolic Acid: CBGA is a nonpsychoactive precursor to all other cannabinoids,\nincluding THC, CBD, CBC and CBG. Much of a cannabis plant’s CBGA ultimately transforms into\nother cannabinoids through the chemical process of decarboxylation. CBGA is used for analgesic and\nanti-inflammatory applications. Certain cannabis strains cultivated to produce industrial hemp prod-\nucts are believed to contain high levels of CBG relative to other strains.\n\nCBN Cannabinol: CBN has been shown to produce some psychoactive effects and is believed to\nhave several medicinal benefits, such as analgesic, antibacterial, anticonvulsive, anti-inflammatory and\nanti-insomnia. Unlike many other cannabinoids, CBN is not derived directly from CBGA decarboxyl-\nation; instead, it results from THC degradation. The CBN level of a cannabis plant is sometimes used\nas a measure of the plant’s overall quality for consumption.\n\nTHCA _ Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinolic Acid: THCA is found abundantly in raw cannabis flower\nand is the precursor to THC. THCA is nonpsychoactive and is believed to have several medicinal\nbenefits, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic. THCA decarboxylates into THC\nthrough drying or application of intense heat, such as the heat applied during smoking or vaporizing\nthe cannabis plant.\n\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC 21\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024657\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

As we noted above the fiscal stimulus is likely to\nbe back loaded as far as 2017 is concerned. In the meantime the FX and Rates teams\npredict an 8-10% appreciation of the USD from pre-election levels and 10Y rates about\n80bp higher. Our economists note that a 10% appreciation of the USD is estimated to\nslice around 0.5% off of US GDP growth over two years. Higher mortgage rates from\nhigher bond yields would also likely dampen growth. As a result, they have actually\nlowered their forecast for US growth in the first half of next year to around 1.5% before\nseeing it rebound to around 2.3% in H2 and then 2.5% in 2018 as the fiscal stimulus\nfeeds through.\n\nVarious Fed members, notably Bill Dudley of the NY Fed, have said this year that a\nstronger USD would have an impact on monetary policy. So to some extent we see USD\nstrength as self-limiting as it would start to lower the profile of likely Fed tightening.\n\nOur economists are also cautious as to the extent of the impact of the Trump fiscal\nplans. Assuming that there is a compromise between the Trump administration and\nCongress our economists think the likely scale of tax cuts is $2-3tn over 10 years, with\n$200-300bn of this in 2017. Given the low estimated multiplier from any proposed tax\ncuts and a Congress likely to limit the amount of an increase in government spending,\nthey look for a modest 0.5% boost to growth.\n\nUpside risk to growth and rates if Trump does more on fiscal, less on trade\n\nIf Congress passes more of the Trump stimulus plan, particularly on the infrastructure\nside, and there are no significant changes to trade or immigration policies then our US\neconomists think growth could potentially hit 3% in 2017 and 3.5% in 2018. That would\nlikely be accompanied by a faster pace of Fed hikes than they currently assume (which is\ntwo hikes between now and end 2017 followed by 3 in 2018).\n\nTrade policy and its impact vital\n\nThe other key factor of the new administration is going to be the direction on trade.\nPresident elect Trump has already said he will pull out of the TPP, TTIP looks likely to\nget the same treatment, while NAFTA is set to be renegotiated. Meantime Trump said\nhe will label China a currency manipulator. This is the other side of the Peak\nGlobalisation/Peak Inequality coin and none of it looks good for global trade.

As explained above, Rule 410 does not create a privilege and the intervenors waived any\nwork-product privilege. The intervenors concede too that the right to counsel under the Sixth\nAmendment had not yet attached when the correspondence was exchanged. Lumley v, City of\nDade City, Fla., 327 F.3d 1186, 1195 (1 1th Cir. 2003) (“{TJhe Sixth Amendment right to\ncounsel ordinarily does not arise until there is a formal commitment by the government to\nprosecute,” such as a “formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or\narraignment.”). The “conjunctive” power of three false claims of privilege does not rescue the\ncorrespondence from disclosure. . ..\n\nThe Supreme Court has identified several considerations relevant to whether a court should\nrecognize an evidentiary privilege—the needs of the public, whether the privilege is rooted in the\nimperative for confidence and trust, the evidentiary benefit of the denial of the privilege, and any\nconsensus among the states, Jaffee v. Redmond, 518 U.S. 1, 10-15 (1996}—but none of these\nconsiderations weighs in favor of recognizing a new privilege to prevent discovery of the plea\nnegotiations. Although plea negotiations are vital to the functioning of the criminal justice\nsystem, a prosecutor and target of a criminal investigation do not enjoy a relationship of\nconfidence and trust when they negotiate. Their adversarial relationship, unlike the confidential\nrelationship of a doctor and patient or attorney and client, warrants no privilege beyond the terms\nof Rule 410. See Jaffee, 518 U.S. at 10. But the victims would enjoy an evidentiary benefit from\nthe disclosure of plea negotiations to prove whether the United States violated their rights under\nthe Act.\n\nMoving forward, this case raises the important issue of what kinds of remedies are available for\nviolations of the Crime Victims’ Rights Act. Our complaint alleges that, prodded by Epstein, the\nfederal prosecutors deliberately concealed the sweetheart plea deal they had reached with him to\navoid public criticism of the deal.

Meerkats teach their young how to hunt dangerous but energy-\nrich scorpion prey, providing an education that bypasses the risks of trial and error learning. Humans\nunconsciously wrinkle their noses and pull back their lips into an expression of disgust that communicates\ninformation about disease-ridden and toxic substances, thereby lowering the costs of sickness to others\nwho might be exposed. Each of these specializations involve exquisitely designed neural circuits and\nsensory machinery. Each specialization is used for one and only one problem — except in humans.\nAnimal thoughts and emotions are like monogamous relationships, myopically and faithfully focused on a\nsingle problem for life. Human thoughts and emotions are like promiscuous relationships, broad-minded\nand liberated, free to couple as new problems surface.\n\nUnlike any other animal, the thoughts and emotions we use to solve problems in one domain can\nreadily be combined and recombined with thoughts and emotions from other domains. This is powerful,\nproviding great flexibility in addressing novel problems, some of which we create for ourselves. Disgust\nprovides an example. Disgust originally evolved as an adaptive response to detecting substances that are\ntoxic to our health, especially substances that are outside of the body but should be inside: feces, urine,\nblood, and vomit. Within the circulation of a promiscuous brain, however, disgust journeys to distant\nproblems, including the moral attitude of vegetarians toward meat eaters, our revulsion toward incest, and\nabhorrence of gratuitous torture. This journey involves the same brain mechanism that serves original\ndisgust, together with new connections that give voice to our moral sense. Promiscuity enables creativity.\n\nWhat the sciences reveal is that the capacity for promiscuous thinking was realized by\nevolutionary changes in the number of newly wired up brain areas. By increasing these connections, it\nwas possible, for the first time, to step outside the more narrow and specialized functions of each\nparticular brain area to solve a broader range of problems. Though we don’t know precisely when these\nchanges occurred, we know they occurred after our split from the other great apes — the orangutans,\ngorillas, bonobos and chimpanzees.

With respect to actions in\nparticular, humans sometimes use their\nown motor repertoire in interpreting\nactions, possibly by imagining or\nmentally simulating the perceived\naction. When people are asked to\nobserve the actions of others,\nparticularly goal-directed actions\ninvolving the hands or mouth, they seem\nto activate brain regions for moving the\nhands or mouth. Thus, there is a link\nbetween observing actions and executing\nactions. This has a relevance to\neducation as well: “Understanding by\ndoing” (1.e., by observing and then\nexecuting) has a long and valued\ntradition in American education’, and\nthese recent scientific results might help\nus understand why this is effective.\n\nWhen my son was 5 years old, he\nwas a member of a kids’ soccer team in\nHyde Park, on the campus of the\nUniversity of Chicago. His coach was a\nprofessor of history at the university, a\nwoman who had never played soccer,\nbut was a voracious reader, and in her\nreadings on the subject, took careful note\nof all the methods needed to play soccer\nas well as the rules and regulations. She\nmethodically took the kids through all\nthe (theoretically relevant motor) steps\nneeded to dribble the ball, to pass, and to\nshoot — flex your foot this way, bend\nyour leg that way, keep your arms this\nway, etc. The kids tried to follow the\nverbal instructions but their motor\nperformance was less than stellar — they\nlearned a little bit, but they lost all of\ntheir dozen games, for a depressing 0-12\nrecord. The next season, the same team\nwas coached by another volunteer\nparent, this time an engineer from\n\nPage |77\n\nTrinidad, who had played soccer his\nwhole life. The instructions he gave the\nkids were quite different: “Follow me\nand do what I do”. There were no\nsuggested foot flexions or extensions,\nand no specific leg movements\nproposed. The kids learned the skills,\nand won all their games. Why? The kids\nlearned by observing a good model and\nthen imitating what they observed the\nperson doing, which appears to be a way\nto learn motor skills that is far stronger\nthan that of explicit motor instruction.\n\nWhen people have strokes, a part\nof their brain dies, and they can lose the\nability to speak or use a hand properly.\nWe are now using this idea of imitation\nin a treatment program to re-educate\npeople with strokes to use their hands\nbetter and to pronounce words better.\nFor these imitation-based treatments,\npeople first observe a particular hand\naction or speech sample on a video\nmonitor, and then they try to produce it.\nIn fact, they observe it over and over\nagain for a while before they even try to\ndo it at all. They are never told how to\nmove their hands or mouths; they are\njust told to copy what they see. Over the\ncourse of six weeks, people with hand\nproblems progress from imitating a\nsimple grasp of a cup to picking up a\ntelephone and dialing a number to\npicking up a toothbrush, brushing their\nteeth, and returning the brush to the sink.\nThose with speech problems progress\nfrom imitating simple words of a single\nsyllable to longer less common words\nand even short phrases. We have already\nshown that these therapies have\nbeneficial effects in a number of people\nand are now trying it out more\nextensively.\n\nThere seems to be an important\nlink between observing and executing\nactions.

Particle physicists hypothesize that\ndark matter consists of a type of particle called the\nneutralino, which has a useful property: When two\nneutralinos collide, they annihilate each other in a\nblaze of gamma rays. Such reactions could drive a\nship forward. Like the hydrogen scooper, a dark-mat-\nter ship could approach the speed of light.

If you want to do\nsome eons-long calculation, go off and explore some\ndistant star system and the result will be ready for you\nwhen you return. The starship crews of the future may\nnot be voyaging for survival, glory, or conquest. They\nmay be solving puzzles.\n\nGoing Warp: Bending Time and Space\nWith a ship moving at a tenth the speed of light,\nhumans could migrate to the nearest stars within a\nlifetime, but crossing the galaxy would remain a jour-\nney of a million years, and each star system would still\nbe mostly isolated. To create a galactic version of the\nglobal village, bound together by planes and phones,\nyou'd need to travel faster than light.\n\n10\n\nContrary to popular belief, Emstein’s theory of rela-\ntivity does not rule that out completely. According to\nthe theory, space and time are elastic; what we perceive\nas the force of gravity is in fact the warping of space and\ntime. In principle, you could warp space so severely that\nyou'd shorten the distance you want to cross, like fold-\ning arug to bring the two sides closer together. If so, you\ncould cross any distance instantaneously. You wouldn’t\neven notice the acceleration, because the field would\nzero out g-forces inside the ship. The view from the ship\nwindows would be stunning. Stars would change in col-\nor and shift toward the axis of motion.\n\nIt seems almost mean-spirited to point out how far\nbeyond our current technology this idea is. Warp drive\nwould require a type of material that exerts a gravita-\ntional push rather than a gravitational pull. Such mate-\nrial contains a negative amount of energy—literally less\nthan nothing, as if you had a mass of —50 kilograms.\nPhysicists, inventive types that they are, have imagined\nways to create such energy, but even they throw up their\nhands at the amount of negative energy a starship would\nneed: a few stars’ worth. What is more, the ship would\nbe impossible to steer, since control signals, which are\nrestricted to the speed of light, wouldn’t be fast enough\nto get from the ship’s bridge to the propulsion system\nlocated on the vessel’s perimeter. (Equipment within\nthe ship, however, would function just fi\n\nWhen it comes to starships, it’s best not to get hung up\non details. By the time humanity gets to the point it might\nactually build one, our very notions of travel may well\nhave changed. “Do we need to send full humans?” asks\nLong. “Maybe we just need to send embryos, or maybe in\nthe future, you could completely download yourself into\na computer, and you can remanufacture yourself at the\nother end through something similar to 3-D printing.”\nToday, a starship seems like the height of futuristic think-\ning.

The computer would take typed\ninput from a user and then, based on what it understood, ask a question back to\ncontinue the conversation. The approach was borrowed from the psychological\ntheories of Carl Rogers, an American therapist who believed the best way to talk to\npatients was with open ended, careful questions. Weizenbaum developed two\nprograms. The first was called DOCTOR, a script that determined what the computer\nmight say. The natural language processor responsible for carrying on the human\nside of the conversation he called ELIZA, after the heroine from Pygmalion, a poor\ncockney girl who is trained by a phonetics professor to pass as a duchess.\n\nHere is a discussion between ELIZA and a user that Weizenbaum recorded in 1965:\nPatient: “Men are all alike.”\n\nELIZA: “IN WHAT WAY?”\n\nPatient: “They’re always bugging us about something or other.”\n\nELIZA: “CAN YOU THINK OF A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE?”\n\nPatient: “Well, my boyfriend made me come here.”\n\nELIZA: “YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE?”\n\nPatient: “He says | am depressed most of the time.”\n\nELIZA: “I AM SORRY TO HEAR YOU ARE DEPRESSED.”\n\nPatient: “It’s true, I’m depressed most of the time.”\n\nELIZA: “DO YOU THINK COMING HERE WILL HELP YOU TO NOT BE UNHAPPY?”\n\nPatient: “I need some help, that much seems certain.”\n\nWeizenbaum’s program quickly became famous around MIT. (The joke was that it\nwas a better conversationalist than most of the awkward shoegazers studying at the\nCambridge campus.) ELIZA gave users a chance to have a taste of a machine with\nsomething like a mind of its own. The program spread to other campuses, to\ndifferent research institutions, and with every step of its success, Weizenbaum\nfound himself more distressed. He summarized his worries in his 1972 masterpiece\nComputer Science and Human Reason. What troubled him was not ELIZA, but her\nusers, the humans. Even when they were professional psychologists, many of them\nquickly considered it reasonable to think that one day the work of diagnosis and\ncounseling might be turned over to machines. This felt like a natural next step in the\nceaseless progress they were used to in their lives.

On 29 November 1947, the UN General Assembly\nvoted Resolution 181, also known as the Partition Plan. It called for the creation of two\nstates—one Palestinian and one Jewish.\n\nOther key UN Resolutions include General Assembly Resolution 194 (1948), which\ncalls for the return of Palestinian refugees; General Assembly Resolution 303 (1949),\nwhich designates Jerusalem to be placed under UN jurisdiction; and, most famously,\nSecurity Council Resolution 242 (1967), which calls on Israel to withdraw from all\nterritory seized during the Six Day War of 1967.\n\nParadoxically, some of the Resolutions are seen by both parties as supporting their\nside of the argument. For example, in Resolution 242 the interpretation of the clause\ncalling for “withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent\nconflict” has been controversially ambiguous, and the object of widely different inter-\npretations. The key argument relates to whether the clause requires Israel to withdraw\nfrom all territory occupied in the 1967 war, or only from some parts of the territory\ncaptured. While many Resolutions have had hardly any effect, they nevertheless\ncontinue to be used as points of reference in the different attempts to resolve the\nconflict.\n\nON PART IV: REGIONAL DOCUMENTS\n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian issue cannot be seen in isolation: it affects and has been affected.\nby broader regional dynamics and conflicts for a century. After years of colonial\ncompetition, France and the United Kingdom drew lines in the sand through the\nSykes-Picot Agreement of 1916. This agreement divided the region into spheres of\ninfluence, and eventually led to the creation of new countries. In the subsequent thirty\nyears, several programmatic initiatives were taken in the context of multiple anti-\ncolonial campaigns for national self-determination and political sovereignty, including\nthe quest of the Jewish people for a national homeland.\n\nThe 1948 war between Arab countries and the newly founded State of Israel resulted\nin the latter significantly expanding its territory beyond that allotted to it by the UN\nPartition Plan. This marked the beginning of more than half a century of Israeli-Arab\ntensions and conflicts. Gradually the focus moved from the legitimacy of the state of\nIsrael to the country’s territorial boundaries. This coincided with broadening support,\nnot only internationally but also in Israel, for the establishment of a Palestinian state\nliving peacefully, side by side, with the state of Israel, within mutually secured borders.\n\nObtaining the regional buy-in to peace with Israel began with the different armistice\nagreements signed in the wake of the 1948 war. While these agreements ended the war,\nthe fighting continued to flare up as the armistice lines established were not inter-\nnationally recognized borders.\n\nThe Arab-Israeli conflict came to a new head with the Six Day War in June 1967,\nwhen Israel conquered the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West\nBank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria. In the\naftermath, Arab nations unified their position against Israel with the Arab League\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023169\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

They too head off to test their skills at coding,\nencryption, system design. They are almost all auto-didact - self taught as\nprogrammers or hackers or AI designers or investors. There is no established path\nto power for them, no route that has been marked before. No wonder the greatest\nfigures of the era are college dropouts. This is a group that looks largely ahead:\nTheir work demands constant upgrade. Every device is shipped imperfect. It’s not to\nsay they are completely denuded of the Sixth Sense. That their feeling for history has\nbeen stripped. But if to be honestly in love with version 1.0 of your product and then\nto shred it for version 2,0 does demand a certain ahistoric distance. The New Caste\nexplorers have a hunger for fresh worlds and landscapes. To get there they endure\nprivations of long isolation - not so extreme as a long ship journey — but they\nburrow deeper and deeper into systems, construct new links and new gates, in\nclosed rooms. “When building machine learning systems, making good decisions is a\nstrategic skill,” the computer scientist Andrew Ng has said. “Every day you wake up\nand you are in some totally unique situation that no one in the planet has been in\nbefore. It’s not a fact, there’s no procedure.” 16\n\nThis is our world now. No fact, yet. No procedure. A totally unique situation that\ndemands a fresh instinct. We can follow Goethe into our own age: No one who has\nnot seen and felt himself surrounded on all sides by networks can honestly\nunderstand. If that motto of the last great epochal shift was Dare to Know, it was\ncertainly enacted by the sea captains. Discovery and risk were nothing but a nervy\nkind of scientific experiment, where the laboratory was the Earth’s surface and the\ntools of calculation were ships. And in our age? If we're right that our historic\nmandate is Dare to Connect, well the New Caste is certainly doing that, furiously.\nThey are working away at much that is hidden in our world, just like those old\nexplorers. The billions of phones or sensors or Al-rooted sensor engines spilling out\naround our world are stripping away layer after layer of opacity. Pictures of far\naway places, traffic lessons learned from movement patterns recorded by GPS-\nenabled phones, medical treatments refined by constant measurement - these are\nall knotted, one after another, into the fishnet.\n\nIf the ocean voyages of that older explorer caste mapped our world, the voyages of\nthe New Caste are as much inward as out. They move inside the world of connected\nsystems. Remember: Network power is defined by dynamic tension - the pull\nbetween center and periphery. The same dynamism is at work with the New Caste.\nWhile they are, firmly, in the business of going out and opening our eyes to the\nworld with wider, faster connection, they are also draping huge, essential parts of\nour lives with an impenetrable fustian: The essential algorithms of search engines,\nthe code of machine learning tools, the design of micro-targetted political influence\ncampaign. The sources of New Caste power are wrapped inside layers of complex\ncomputer code, machine learning and data security protocols that few people can\n\n165 “When building”: Andrew Ng, speech at GPU Technology Conference (March,\n2015)\n\n115\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018347\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It is unlikely they would have gone to\nthe trouble since they had Snowden in the palm of their hand in Moscow. It doesn’t take a great\nstretch of the imagination to conclude that, by one way or another, willingly or under duress,\nSnowden shared his access to his treasure trove of documents with the agencies that were literally\nin control of his life in Russia.\n\nKucherena’s answer to the question of access also may help to explain Putin’s decision to allow\nSnowden to come to Moscow. As has been discussed earlier, it was not a minor sacrifice for\nPutin. His foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, had spent almost six months negotiating with Hillary\nClinton’s State Department a one-on-one summit between President Obama and President Putin.\nNot only would this summit be a diplomatic coup for Russia but it would add to Putin’s personal\ncredibility in advance of the Olympic Games in Russia. In mid-June, after US intelligence\nreported to Obama’s National Security adviser that Snowden was in contact with Russian officials\nin Hong Kong, the State Department explicitly told Lavrov that allowing Snowden to defect to\nRussia would be viewed by President Obama as a blatantly unfriendly act. As such, it could (and\ndid) lead to the cancellation of the planned summit. So Putin knew the downside of admitting\nSnowden.\n\nBut there was also an upside if Snowden had access to the NSA documents. A large archive of\nfiles containing the sources of the NSA’s electronic interceptions, as Snowden claimed he had in\nHong Kong, had enormous potential intelligence value Putin therefore had to choose between\nthe loss of an Obama summit and the gain of an intelligence coup. That Putin chose the latter\nsuggests that he had calculated that the utility of the intelligence that the NSA archive outweighed\nthe public relations advantages of the Obama summit (which, after Snowden arrived in Moscow,\nwas cancelled by Obama.) Would Putin have made such a sacrifice if Snowden had destroyed or\nrefused to share the stolen data? “No country, not even the United States, would grant sanctuary\nto an intelligence defector who refused to be cooperative,” answered a former CIA officer who\nhad spent a decade dealing with Russian intelligence defectors. “That’s not how it works.” If so, it\nseems plausible to me that, as Kucherena said, that Snowden’s documents were accessible to him\neither on a computer or via storage in the cloud after he arrived in Moscow. It explains why\nRussia exfiltrated him from Hong Kong and provided him with a safe haven,\n\nThe Quickly Changing Narrative\n\nJust three weeks after Kucherena’s stunning disclosure, Snowden changed the narrative. His\nfirst exchange with an American journalist after his arrival in Russia was not until October 1°7,\n2013. It was conducted over the Internet with James Risen, a Pulitzer-prize winning New York\nTimes reporter. Essentially Snowden supplied answers to a set of questions. In then, Snowden\nnow asserted he took no documents to Russia. The subsequent front-page story, which carried\nthe headline, “Snowden Says He Took No Secret Files to Russia,” reported that Snowden\nclaimed that he gave all his documents to journalists in Hong Kong and he brought none of them\nto Russia. He also said that he was “100 percent” certain that no foreign intelligence service had had\naccess to them at any point during his journey from Honolulu to Moscow.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020291\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

With\nrespect to share repurchase, EWBC seemed less enthusiastic to buy back stock at\ncurrent valuation levels (2.3x TBV).\n\nFist Hawaiian (FHB), C-2-7, Neutral\nPositive outlook around the Hawaiian economy. Chairman and CEO Robert\nHarrison and CFO/Treasurer Michael Ching were optimistic with regards to the\noutlook for the Hawaiian economy, particularly around tourism trends. While the\nrecent strength of the dollar could impact the inflow of foreign tourists (with Japan\nand Canada the key foreign markets for HI) to the island, management noted that\nthe potential for an increases in domestic tourism could help offset the pressure\nfrom any slowdown due to a stronger USD.\n\n- Positioned well for higher rates. With regards to its outlook on the impact of\npotentially higher interest rates, management noted that it remains asset sensitive\nwith 60% of its loan portfolio floating rate. On the funding side FHB expects the\ndeposit beta to remain low given the competitive dynamics in the Hawaii landscape.\nManagement anticipates that another 25bp increase in the Fed Funds rate in\nDecember could have a similar impact on the NIM (+6bp) as it experienced\nfollowing the previous rate hike in Dec '15.\n\n¢ Cash deployment to securities completed. Management noted that it has\ncompleted the liquidity actions that it planned to take from deploying excess cash\ninto its securities portfolio and the full impact of this should be visible in 4Q\nresults. Note the securities portfolio duration is 3.3yrs at the end of 3Q16.\nManagement noted that it prefers to keep $400-500mn at the Fed in cash liquidity.\n\n+ Continued focus on maintaining dividend payout. In terms of capital\nmanagement, management reiterated that it would like to maintain a healthy\ndividend payout. Given that additional capital return from buybacks are limited due\nto the Fed’s CCAR process (which FHB is subject to given that it is part of a larger\nholding company owned by BNP), management intends to increase its capital\npayout to shareholders (via higher dividend and buybacks) over time.\n\nExpenses to stay relatively elevated in near term. During the audience poll, when\nasked about what management should prioritize in 2017, 38% of the investors\npolled noted that they would like management to manage core expense growth\nwhile 31% would like management to increase the dividend payout to over 50% of\nearnings. Management noted that the efficiency ratio would likely trend around\n50%, modestly higher than the 48.5% it reported in 3Q as it incurs additional public\ncompany costs ($14.5 — 17mn of expenses), but over time should move back below\nin the mid-to-high 40s.\n\n18 2016 Future of Financials Conference | 17 November 2016 Bankof America 2\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014332\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

As such, we will be looking to come up with\nideas that will have a minimum six month horizon and ideally longer than a year. The\nindividual trade ideas will be sourced from our strategists across BofA Merrill Lynch\nGlobal Research.\n\nThis publication is not meant to be an agglomeration of all the trade ideas published by\nBofAML Global Research strategists, but instead represents those that fit with our\nlonger term themes (as opposed to shorter term tactical trades). In addition, there may\nbe several different trade ideas published by BofAML Global Research strategists across\ndifferent asset classes that seek to leverage off of the same theme. In most cases we\nwill seek merely to take the trades that have the best risk adjusted return. By risk\nadjusted we mean the risk undertaken in a trade vs the likely return on that trade. In\nconsidering that we will look at the underlying volatility in the individual asset class. This\nwill be combined with our own view of what the likely downside is in an adverse\nscenario vs the payoff in the expected scenario and our own assessment of the\nlikelihoods of such scenarios.\n\nOnce selected it is assumed that the trade would likely be retained for a minimum of six\nmonths (as per the selection rationale). Should any analyst change their view on the trade\nand cease to recommend it, then it will be immediately removed from our list’. Equally\nshould our target be met for a trade and the relevant strategist feels it has run its course\nthen it will also be removed (see footnote). Otherwise we will review our trades on a\nmonthly basis in this publication. If we feel a new trade idea has a better risk adjusted\nreturn than an existing one in the same asset class then we would replace it.\n\nThe objective of the trades is that they would be suitable for a typical objective of the\nmulti-asset fund managers, which is typically framed in terms of a Libor+ benchmark\n(this can be anything from Libor +300bp to Libor +700bp). That return is also coupled\nwith a target volatility, for example half MSCI ACWI volatility. The volatility target will,\nof course, be a function of the expected return, but there is a general focus on\nproducing lower volatility returns. Our set of trades should not be regarded as a\nportfolio but a collection of ideas to implement in a multi-asset portfolio.\n\nAppendix 2 - Recommended COCO bonds\n\nTable 4: COCO basket\n\nISIN Bond Issuing entity Price Mid YtM\nXS$1055037177 ACAFP 6.5% EUR Perp-21 CREDIT AGRICOLE SA 100.5 54\nXS$1002801758 BACR 8% EUR Perp-20 BARCLAYS PLC 100.9 a\nXS$1033661866 BBVASM 7% EUR Perp-19 BANCO BILBAO VIZCAYA ARG 91.1 al\nX$1073143932 NYKRE 4% EUR 2036-21 NYKREDIT REALKREDIT AS 102.4 2f\nXS0972523947 CS 5.75% EUR 2025-20 CREDIT SUISSE 107.6 3.6\nDEO00DB/XHP3 DB 6% EUR Perp-22 DEUTSCHE BANK AG 18.3 67\nXS$1043545059 | LLOYDS 6.375% EUR Perp-20 | LLOYDS BANKING GROUP PLC 97.5 57\nXS$1171914515 | RABOBK 5.5% EUR Perp-20 | COOPERATIEVE RABOBANK UA 98.5 5.5\nXS0867620725 | SOCGEN 6.75% EUR Perp-21 SOCIETE GENERALE 98.8 5.9\nXS1107890847 | UCGIM 6.75% EUR Perp-21 UNICREDIT SPA 84.5 if\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research *As of 28/11/2016 close\n\n| Under these circumstances, we will publish a note immediately.\n\nBankof America\n\nMerrill Lynch Global Cross Asset Strategy - Year Ahead | 30 November 2016 23\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014454\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Still, the mood music going into the\nmeeting was encouraging. After the election, Arafat had tried to use his ties with\nthe ayatollahs in Iran to get them to release 13 members of the tiny Jewish\ncommunity in Shiraz who had been jailed on patently absurd accusations of spying\nfor the “Zionist régime.” Iran had told him no. Given its support for Hizbollah, and\nits serial diatribes about destroying the State of Israel, this was hardly a surprise.\nBut it was a gesture nonetheless, and I told him I appreciated it. I also arrived with\na gift: a leather-bound volume with both the Hebrew Bible and Koran. I began our\nmeeting with what I felt I most needed him to hear: that both of us were trying to\nachieve something hugely important, nothing less than a new relationship between\nIsraelis and Palestinians based on trust. As I would discover in the months ahead —\nas Yitzhak had found as well — Arafat responded warmly to such general appeals\nof principle. He replied that he viewed me as a partner, and a friend. But the key\nissue of substance — the difference between how I envisaged taking Oslo forward\nand what he wanted — was impossible to avoid.\n\nI emphasized that I was committed to the further Wye River summit\nredeployments Bibi which had agreed, although not implemented, as well as to a\nrelease of Palestinian prisoners agreed at Wye. Yet then came the more difficult\npart: explaining my view of how we could best move toward a full peace\nagreement. I said I was convinced the prospects would be much better if we\ndelayed the redeployments and brought forward the start of the real negotiations:\non “permanent-status” issues like final borders, settlements, Jerusalem, refugees. In\nany case, I said, I’'d need a few months for a thorough assessment of the issues\ninvolved, and to reach a settled view with my negotiating team on how to proceed.\nArafat seemed to accept the idea of a pause for reflection and planning. But he held\nfirm in his opposition to any further delay in the Wye redeployments. More\nworryingly for the longer-term prospects of an agreement, he ignored altogether\nmy suggestion that we move ahead toward the permanent-status talks.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, I was careful to accentuate the positive. I said the reason\nI’d come to see Arafat so soon was because of the importance I attached to his role\nin “shaping peace in the Middle East.” I said I would not waver in continuing on\nthe path which Rabin and he and begun. And while the security of Israel would be\nmy paramount concern in negotiations, “I also want each Palestinian to feel\nsecure.” Both sides, I said, had suffered enough.

Rev. 861, *969\n\ndiscussed in connection with Rule 1 above, *?? Rule 60(b)(2) was revised to make clear that a victim's \"representative\" could\nassert a victim's right.\n\nC. The Last Word? Legislation to Fully Implement the CVRA\n\nUnsatisfied with the timid approach taken by the Advisory Committee on the CVRA, Senator Jon Kyl introduced legislation to\ncomprehensively amend the federal rules on June 29, 2007. Senator Kyl explained that the Advisory Committee's amendments\n\"do little more than reiterate limited parts of the statute.\" °° Agreeing with the major premise of this Article - that crime\nvictims must be treated fairly in the criminal justice process - Senator Kyl noted: \"Of particular importance, the CVRA\nguaranteed that crime victims would have the right to be treated with \"fairness.' My proposed amendments would add to the\nFederal rules the changes needed to treat crime victims fairly.\" ®°! Senator Kyl was also concerned about delay by the\nAdvisory Committee in moving forward with comprehensive amendments:\n\nCongress enacted the CVRA in October 2004. In the almost 3 years since then, I have waited patiently to give the federal courts\nthe first opportunity to review the need for rule changes. At the same time, though, I have made clear my position, as one of the\ncosponsors of the CVRA, that Congress expected significant reforms in the Federal rules. As I explained to my colleagues at\nthat time, the crime victims’ [*970] community in this country was looking to the CVRA to serve as a model for the states and\na formula to fully protect crime victims. °°?\n\nAccordingly, Senator Kyl proposed a long string of direct amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to\ncomprehensively protect victims’ rights.\n\nSome of the legislation that Senator Kyl proposed tracked my proposals in this Article. For example, he proposed amendments\nto a number of rules - including Rules 2, 10.1, © 11(b)(4), 11(c)(1), 11(c)(2), 12.1, 12.3, 15, 21(e), 32(f)(1), 32(h), 43.1, 44,\n46, and 50(c) - largely tracking my proposals.\n\nBut other proposed changes went well beyond those I propose here. For example, Senator Kyl proposed changing Rule 4's\nprovision dealing with execution of arrest warrants to require reasonable efforts to give notice to victims about the initial\n\nappearance of an arrested suspect. ©°4 Along the same lines, Senator Kyl would give victims reasonable notice of any decision\n\n605\n\nto release a defendant at the initial appearance as well as notice of any pretrial conference. °° He also would give federal\n\nprosecutors authority to release to a victim any discovery materials that have been released to the defendant. °°” To assist non-\nEnglish speaking crime victims, he proposes to give the courts authority to appoint an interpreter for the victim. °% Senator\nKyl's bill would also require disclosure to the victim of any presentence report \"except any portion of such report excised by\n\nthe court for compelling reasons or made confidential by law.\" ©? And his bill would require that the victim be given a\n\nreasonable opportunity to be heard before any motion for a new trial is granted. °!°\n\n599 See supra notes 117-126 and accompanying text.\n\n600 153 Cong.

For such a device, to pass Turing’s Test or slip past a Voight-Kampff check\nmachine will be trivial. In his 1950 paper, Turing sensed the possibility of this\ndevelopment - and the crisis that might ensue. Could man handle the crushing\nsensation that a device was outperforming him? Perhaps dramatically. “We like to\nbelieve that Man is in some subtle way superior to the rest of creation,” Turing\nwrote. “It is best if he can be shown to be necessarily superior, for then there is no\ndanger of him losing his commanding position.” What would have surprised Turing,\nI suppose, is the speed at which we've acquiesced - and even accelerated - this very\nloss of our dominance.\n\nImagine a device poking at the very origins of the universe at a speed of trillions of\ncalculations a second, spinning past Newton’s and Einstein’s laws and into a realm\nof physics apprehensible only inside its own electronic consciousness. Compacting\ntime - centuries of human scientific labor reproduced in moments - before shooting\nfar ahead, alone to a subtle knowledge we can only envy. Such a machine would not,\nas Newton had, stand on the shoulders of giants so much as it would muscle its own,\nunique way ahead. The AI would have disappeared, but to a place very different\nthan where Maes’ AI had gone. Hers had been erased by human design. This new,\nreally “thinking” AI would slip to invisibility because of its own light-speed\ncognition. It would think itself out of our understanding. No human could follow,\nlimited as we are by our wet, slow, decaying biological software. Humans and\ncomputers, after all, deal with information differently. Think of how poor your\nmemory is compared with the perfect fidelity of a machine, or the way people can\neven “remember” events that never happened. The machines would have more than\nknowledge, then. They would linger close to a possessing a profound and\ninscrutable wisdom. They would inhabit an honestly miraculous gateland that no\nhuman would ever enter. And this is where the problems would begin.\n\n2.\n\nWe've now passed the moment when humans completely train the very best\nmachines. The AI devices can teach themselves, now. Of course there are still\ndecades of adjustment, of leaps in hardware and programming ideas to eliminate\nthe seams between our minds and the fused ideas of a digital system. But the\nhumans in the loop of the best of these designs, the hard working and well meaning\ngeniuses of the New Caste, are as much trainers as engineers now. They resemble\nshipbuilders of an earlier era, preparing vessels for voyages to lands they will never\nthemselves see. Their digital minds - technically machine learning structures such\nas deep neural networks - run quickly to the frontiers. Every moment, all around us,\nmachines are educating themselves. About the world. About themselves. About us\ntoo. Tuned AI plays games, looks at photos, studies chemical reactions, reads your\nemail and watches you drive - and then it tries to unspool just what is going on,\nbefore winding it up into a new instinct. Machine learning systems already produce\nmathematical proofs that linger beyond what a human mind can understand; next\nmay be a machine-to-machine mathematics that expands the dimensions of thought.\n(In aman and machine fusion that surely would have unnerved Joseph Weizenbaum\n\n189\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018421\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The case law is clear that on an\nabuse of process claim a “plaintiff must prove that the process was used for an immediate purpose other\nthan that for which it was designed.” Jd. (citation omitted). Where the actions taken by a party in a\nparticular lawsuit are designed to coerce another into taking some collateral action not properly involved\nin the proceeding a claim of abuse of process is stated. Miami Herald Publishing Company v. Ferre,\n8636 F. Supp. 970 (S.D. Fla. 1985).\n\nIn a case for abuse of process, the question of whether the plaintiffs case satisfies the requisite\nelements is largely a question for a jury. See Patrick John McGinley, 21 Fla. Prac., Elements of an Action\n§ 50:1 (2013-2014 ed.)(citing Gatto v. Publix Supermarket, Inc., 387 So. 2d 377 (Fla. 3d DCA 1980)).\n\nThe usual case of abuse of process involves some form of extortion. Scozari v. Barone, 546 So.\n2d 750, 751(Fla. 3d DCA 1989) (citing Bothmann v. Harrington, 458 So. 2d 1163, 1169 (Fla. 3d DCA\n1984)). That is exactly what has transpired here. Epstein employed the extraordinary financial resources at\nhis disposal to intimidate his molestation victims and Edwards into abandoning their legitimate claims or\nresolving those claims for substantially less than their just and reasonable value. Consequently, since\nEpstein’s sole purpose and ulterior motive for filing the complaint without probable cause was in an effort\nto extort, to wit: to force his molestation victims and Edwards to settle for minimal amounts, that filing\nand everything subsequently done to pursue the claims constitutes an abuse of process. See Exhs. A at 18-\n27, C at 4-7. Because Edwards has conclusively demonstrated that Epstein’s actions in pursuing his\nclaims were designed to coerce Edwards (and his client) to take some collateral action not properly\ninvolved in the proceedings and did so with an ulterior purpose, summary judgment directed at the abuse\nof process claim must fail. The damages suffered by Edwards include: (a) injury to his reputation; (b)\nmental anguish, embarrassment and anxiety; (c) fear physical injury to himself and members of his\nfamily; (d) the loss of the value of his time required to be diverted from his professional responsibility;\n\nand (e) the cost of defending against Epstein’s spurious and baseless claims.

To alter the landscape with one sharp razor\nslice, not a hail of bombs.\n\nThere is no excuse for us to not prepare to struggle in these new terms. Our military\nmust be shifted for the demands of such instant, cross-space attack. But it’s more\nthan that. In recent years America has gotten into a habit of reaching for our military\ntool, and while we've strengthened it to an historically unprecedented degree, we've\nlet other skills atrophy. Our real aim should be to stop our opponents from adapting,\nevolving and connecting to us. If we suffer some strategic, nation-crippling defeat in\nthe future, I don’t think it will be because our military was weak. Rather it will be\nbecause we've not mastered all the other tools of topological control.

The protective order of Tokugawa Japan. The walls of Tang China, part ofa\nchained national history that celebrates heroes as “defenders of the nation,” not\nattackers. Gatekeeping resists unnecessary profligacy. It limits the need to\nproselytize or colonize or force others to our way of thinking. And it has a universal\naspect: Hard Gatekeeping can - with a little imagination and some discipline — be\nlaid on puzzles like terrorism, cyberattacks, US-China relations, order in the Middle\nEast, the proliferation of nuclear weapons, income inequality and global warming. It\nprovides a sharp single image of what we're after - and guidelines for getting there.\nIt’s clear enough what we need to do, I think. Build gates. Use them.

But it was a massive security detail for a well known head of state who had come for tea.\n\nWe met several years before he became arguably the world’s most notorious sex offender. In 2002, his plane, a\nmeticulously appointed 727, ferried a group of people to the TED conference in Monterey. He was the\nmysterious and peculiarly gracious host arriving after everyone had boarded: tanned, relaxed, attentive,\nsoliciting every guest’s story and views, and accompanied by three young women not his daughters, witty,\npoised, helpful, and beautiful—out of a men’s magazine fantasy of the luxe life.\n\nOne more thing about this trip suggesting something of his unique view of the public world and what you got to\nsee when you are near him. Google founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, with their company rising into the\nstratosphere, came out to see his plane on the Monterey tarmac and, with a few other Googlers, literally ran\nwhooping from one end of the plane to the other. Then, sitting in the plane’s plush living room, they described,\nin what I could not be sure was a put-on or entrepreneurial brainstorm, the future of search ..\n\nSince that trip, and through his travails, I have often been invited to his house to participate in the conversations\nof the newest ideas that often take place there.\n\nIn sweatshirt, draw-string pants, palm beach slippers, and half glasses, Jeffrey Epstein—that Epstein, most\nrecently embroiled in charges involved under age women ,Alan Dershowitz and Prince Andrew—spends most\nof his day at his dining room table in the in front of a laptop and beside a row of reading glasses (there are a lot\nof them in case, apparently, he misplaces a pair, but being quite meticulous he never does) conducting what\nmust surely be the world’s most extraordinary colloquial. Pictures on the table have Jeffrey and prime minister,\nprinces, leading scientists.with fidel castro next to the photo with pope, I guess his attempt at levity.\n\nThese meetings, and this lifestyle, have somehow stayed private or secret—or apart—not out of any formal or\nstated restrictions, but because, in some sense, it would be very hard to explain just what you’re doing there\nwith a well known sex offender ina mouth dropping home flaunting all moderation.\n\nAnd yet, defying controversy , and tolerating his societal tone deafness—or shy attitude toward the\nzeitgeist—still so many come. Gladly. Willingly. Feeling that his invitation is frankly quite an extraordinary\nprivilege.\n\nAmong his frequent guests is Bill Gates, for whom Epstein has become a friend, proposing a way to leverage\nthe resources of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to accommodate many other fortunes, so that, Epstein\nexplains, “you might join 10 or 20 billionaires on one giving project.” They can leverage your unique\nexperience and expertise in the philanthropic world and learn from your early mistakes.\nAs part of a many friends encouraged effort to get “out in front” of the notice that might be expected when it\nwas revealed the number and wide diversity of the most rarified thinkers of our generation that come to visit .\nEpstein agreed to a limited on-the-record conversation with me.\n\nHis subject, on a morning in late fall, sitting at the dining room table—its humorous but baronial quality\ndisturbed by an ever-present white board—is “hyper wealth.” His subject is always wealth—how capital , in\nuber amounts should react to the given new global political, economic, and cultural moment.\n\nHis stock in trade is not the making of money, (his proletariat background not withstanding ) but the issues that\narise when wealth growing at a heretofore unimaginable rate, makes its entrance , altering many basic\neconomic, social, and personal calculations. Watching his presentation recounts a math class of the mighty.\n\nThe professor at the blackboard and the students ( the titans ), still hoping they are not called upon to answer a\ndifficult question.\n\nHe recounts a dinner he had two nights before. The scene is, like much of what he does, a conspiracy theorist’s\nfantasy—the six men at this dinner, all technology entrepreneurs, representing, together, over a hundred billion\ndollars and now trying to figure out how to use their resources in order to help shape the world.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023627\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Moreover, we reiterate our neutral allocation to Industrials.\n\n¢ Valuations are high and earnings expectations are optimistic for Consumer Discretionary.

We\nare reluctant to recommend outright long duration positions in US rates at present\ngiven that the sharp election-induced selloff could extend over the coming weeks.\n\nConsensus expects rising inflation\n\nInstead, we focus on contrarian views regarding the outlook for inflation, which\nunderpinned some of short rates positioning and is expected to increase with US fiscal\npolicy expansion and base effects. According to our recent Global Fund Manager Survey\ntaken prior to the election, global inflation expectations are on the rise, with 70% of\nsurvey respondents expecting higher global CPI readings in the near term. Headline CPI\nhas been moving higher in the US, and Chinese PPI recently turned positive for the first\ntime since 2012. Similarly, global market-based measures of inflation expectations have\nbeen rising, with 5y5y forward inflation swaps in the US, UK, and Europe all rising over\nrecent months and US inflation protected funds receiving nearly $2 billion in inflows\nsince the start of October.\n\nDisinflation may strike back\n\nRisks to the near-term outlook for inflation could rise if: (1) expectations for US fiscal\nstimulus disappoint as House deficit hawks insist on revenue-neutral tax cuts or\nspending measures; (2) Beijing pushes the RMB lower before President-elect Trump\ntakes office leading to risk-off and imported disinflation; (3) commodity prices decline if\nan OPEC deal cannot be reached, the USD meaningfully appreciates, or if EM growth\nfalters; or (4) EU slowdown fears rise should the ECB taper due to technical constraints.\n\nWe recommend buying 3-year 0% inflation floors in the US, which currently\ndemand only 9 basis of premium. These levels are low in relation to recent history and\ncould increase if Beijing were to more rapidly weaken the RMB or if commodities falter\n(Chart 43). Investors seeking to offset the premium could consider selling longer-dated\nmore deeply negative floors under the assumption that any near-term disinflation scare\nwould be short-lived and likely be offset by more activist monetary policies thereafter.\nThe risk to the trade is a spike in commodity prices or a continued rise in core inflation.\n\nChart 42: Z-score of duration positioning: short except in Japan/Canada\n\nChart 43: Cost of 3Y¥ 0% deflation floor has spiked with weak RMB (bps)\n\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n-1.5\n-2.0\n\n-2.5\nEU Core UK EUPeriph US JP CA\n\nNote: negative z-score values indicate short positioning, positive z-score values indicate long\npositions; z-score taken from survey net exposure index with responses dating back to 1992 for US,\nCA, JP, UK & EU, EU periphery data available back to 2013.

Saudi Arabia\nCDS premium to Qatar and likely larger issuance size suggests Saudi External Debt\n(EXD) is likely to be issued at a premium to Qatar.\n\nSaudi Arabia international bond issuance latest in wave of Gulf supply\n\nLocal press suggests that Saudi Arabia is gearing up for a large international bond\nissuance program (USS10-15bn issuance target this year), which, if confirmed (the\ngovernment neither confirmed nor denied , should add to the sizeable sovereign bond\nsupply pipeline this year. So far, we have seen USS$17.1bn in gross and net supply from\nthe Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Assuming Saudi Arabia issues US$15bn\nand accounting for planned issuance from Dubai and Bahrain and excluding Kuwait, the\nrest of this year should see a further US$16.5bn in gross issuance and US$16.1bn in net\nissuance. This would bring the total gross and net GCC sovereign bond issuance to\nUS$33.6bn and US$33.2bn this year respectively.\n\nSeminal potential bond issuance has multi-pronged implications\n\nIf confirmed, this could be a seminal event and mark the first time for the Saudi\ngovernment to issue external bonds. It would allow for participation of foreign investors\nas domestic debt is being sold to Saudi banks and funds. External issuance should\ndiversify funding sources, lock in still low interest rates, support SAMA's Fx reserves and\nsupport domestic liquidity; the latter two macro variables have weakened this year.\nExternal issuance would also imply the presence of an underlying asset that could\ntheoretically trigger CDS contracts, as opposed to the current situation.\n\nInvestment grade status to be retained despite likely further rating cuts\n\nA prolonged oil price downturn is likely to continue to put downward pressure on Saudi\nArabia’s credit rating in the medium-term. On average, the GCC has benefited from\nthree notch rating upgrades over the period 2002-10 prior to the start of the Arab\nSpring. Saudi Arabia was upgraded six times, from Baa3 to Aa3, by Moody's over the\nperiod starting from 1999, while it was upgraded two and three notches by S&P and\nFitch over the period starting from 2003/2004 respectively. Moody’s has thus in the\npast preserved Saudi Arabia’s investment grade rating at the bottom of the cycle, as\ngovernment debt to GDP stood at 103% of GDP and SAMA’s foreign assets at US$17bn\n(10% of GDP) in 1999.\n\nEMBIG Index inclusion is unlikely\nEMBIG index inclusion is unlikely, in our view. Estimated 2013 (US$25,140) and three-\n\nyear rolling GNI per capita (US$23,090) data likely suggests Saudi Arabia does not meet\nEMBIG income index inclusion criteria, in our view. Saudi Arabia would however likely be\neligible for Barclays EM Hard Currency Aggregate Index, based on its IMF classification\nas a non-advanced country (noting that the index provider has moved away from solely\nusing rating for EM country classification).

Ambitious plans to grow religious tourism: with Hajj visitors set to increase\nfrom 1.5mn to 2.5mn and Foreign Umrah Pilgrims from 6mn to 15mn per\nannum, we see significant potential for the travel & tourism, transport sectors,\nconsumer discretionary and telecom services sectors to benefit.\n\n2. Down trading as pressure mounts on the consumer: With the NTP looking\nto reduce subsidies on energy (including transport fuels) and water, we see\npressure on the disposable income of Saudi consumers rising in the short- to\nmedium-term (although in the longer term, we expect higher employment\nlevels, growing home ownership and accelerating growth to offset these\nfactors). These issues could be further augmented by a slowdown in public\nsector wage growth and growth in the proportion of residents employed by the\nprivate sector,\n\nIn reflection, we believe that the consumer will likely become more value\nconscious in the near- to medium-term as stress on consumer discretionary\nspend mounts. As such, we continue to prefer the consumer staples and the\ngrocery retailers in this environment. We also believe the grocery retailers will\nbenefit from the government’s focus on formalising the sector (it is highly\nfragmented currently and dominated by smaller independent stores) in an\neffort to increase Saudi participation. That said, we believe consumer\ndiscretionary companies which offer more affordable and economic goods\ncould benefit as they take market share.\n\n3. Rising focus on healthcare provision: Saudi Arabia is focused on significantly\ngrowing accessibility to healthcare for its residents. The provisions in the NTP\ninclude a significant increase in medical centres (hospitals and clinics), wider\nprovision of private health insurance and an increase in the level of\n\n40 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 3S Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016150\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Farmer offered what\nfor Jim Kim was a convincing vision of the new organization. The reality was less impressive -- a charity with a\nboard of advisers and no hired staff...\n\nThey talked about issues such as political correctness, which Jim Kim defined as follows: \"It's a very well-\ncrafted tool to distract us. A very self-centered activity. Clean up your own vocabulary so you can show\neverybody you have the social capital of having been in circles where these things are talked about on a regular\nbasis.\" (What was an example of political correctness? Some academic types would say to Jim and Paul, \"Why\ndo you call your patients poor people? They don't call themselves poor people.\" Jim would reply: \"Okay, how\nabout soon-dead people?\")\n\nThey talked about the insignificance of \"cultural barriers\" when it came to the Haitian peasant's acceptance of\nmodem Western medicine: \"There's nothing like a cure for a disease to change people's cultural values\"...\n\nBy now Peru was taxing PIH's resources severely. On average, the drugs to treat just one patient cost between\nfifteen and twenty thousand dollars. And the number of patients kept growing. Already there were about fifty\nCarabayllanos in treatment. Their average age was twenty-nine. They were students, unemployed youths,\nhousewives, street vendors, bus drivers, health workers. The actual numbers seemed small, but those fifty MDR\n[a form of tuberculosis that does not respond to standard treatment] cases represented about 10 percent of all\nactive cases of TB in the slum, about ten times more than might have been expected. No telling how many\nothers they had been infecting as they'd traveled around Lima, coughing. No telling either how many people in\nother parts of the city already had MDR, but [there were] reports of hundreds in other neighborhoods. In\nCarabayllo itself, the Socios workers found entire families sick and dying with what turned out to be genetically\nrelated strains of the disease--a phenomenon common enough that the health workers gave it a name, familias\ntebeceanas, tuberculosis families.\n\nKim's organization confronted Peru's MDR-form tuberculosis epidemic with what some have called unorthodox\npractices -- borrowing and cajoling its way into medicine for its patients.\n\nHoward Hiatt, a friend of Jim Yong Kim's and a former dean at the Harvard School of Public Health, said he\nwas concerned about how PIH was getting medicine to combat the epidemic:\n\n\"Sure enough. Paul and Jim would stop at the [Harvard-affiliated] Brigham pharmacy before they left for Peru\nand fill their briefcases with drugs. They had sweet-talked various people into letting them walk away with the\ndrugs.\" [Hiatt] was amused, all in all. \"That's their Robin Hood attitude.\" In fact, they'd only borrowed the\ndrugs...\n\nThen one day the president of the Brigham stopped Hiatt in a corridor. \"Your friends Farmer and Kim are in\ntrouble with me. They owe this hospital ninety-two thousand dollars.\" Hiatt looked into the matter. \"Sure\nenough. Paul and Jim would stop at the Brigham pharmacy before they left for Peru and fill their briefcases with\ndrugs. They had sweet-talked various people into letting them walk away with the drugs.\" He was amused, all in\nall. \"That's their Robin Hood attitude.”\n\nTo many seasoned managers of public health projects, what Farmer and Kim were doing would have looked\nquite reckless--like a stunt, as some would later insinuate. They didn't have a guaranteed supply of drugs, only\nthe determination to obtain the drugs and the charm to get away with borrowing. They were borrowing their\nlaboratory services, too, from Massachusetts. They lacked proper institutional support. The weight of expert\nopinion stood against them. Their organization was small and it had other projects, in Haiti and Boston and\nelsewhere, and Peru put a strain on everyone. Jim had to travel to Carabayllo at least once a month. Farmer had\nto go there slightly more often.\n\nKim's audacious ‘Robin Hood attitude’ won him and PIH acclaim for their role in changing global health and\ndevelopment.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013461\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This is fully consistent with our projections for 2017, expecting USD strength to\ncontinue, particularly against JPY, and the scandies to do well against EUR and CHF.\n\nBased on this analysis, we recommend buying USD/JPY and selling CHF/SEK, to position\nfor inflation risks in G1O economies.

We believe that under\na C-corporation structure with a broader potential investor\nbase and ownership, this portion of the Alts earnings are\nmost likely to re-rate significantly higher while there could\nbe more variability in the multiple investors ascribe to per-\nformance fees. We currently believe the market is pricing in\nfee related earnings around 15x times, a discount to where\nthese earnings could trade up to. As we explain in greater\ndetail in the Appendix, we see ARES asa stock that is likely\nto convert, and as we take a look at the SOTP, we believe\nFRE for ARES has already seen significant expansion. We\nestimate the multiple on ARES FRE has already gone up\nfrom 15.0x to 18.4x.\n\nBelow we look at where multiples could trade for the broader\ngroup as a whole, but acknowledge that investors likely use dif-\nferent FRE multiples for companies to account for duration of assets,\ngrowth in AUM, franchise value etc. On average, our three\napproaches suggest a 23.4x multiple for fee related earnings. In our\nupside case we use a 22.5x multiple. These multiples are on 2018e fee\nrelated earnings as we are trying to evaluate where the stocks trade\n\ntoday, and where they could potentially trade to in the near term.\n\n1) Premium to Traditionals Asset Managers\n\nWe see the historical average P/E multiple for traditional asset\nmanagers of 15.4x as a starting point for FRE multiples. The tradi-\ntional asset manager business model earns management fees with a\nsignificantly smaller portion of revenues from performance fees rela-\n\ntive to alternative asset managers.\n\nWe believe the AltsGmanagement fee earnings, however, com-\nmand a premium multiple given several factors: A) faster organic\ngrowth, B) stickier long-term committed assets, C) fees paid on com-\nmitted capital which limits downside risk to revenues, and D) more\n\ninsulation from fee pressure.\n\nExhibit 11:\n\nThe average of our three approaches to FRE multiples suggests and\nFRE multiple of 23.4x\n\nFRE Multiples Across Three Approaches\n\n35.0x\n28.9x\n30.0x 26.0x\n25.0x 23.4x\n20.0x 45 4x\n15.0x\n10.0x\n5.0x\n0.0x\nTraditionals C-Corp Alts Bond Yield Average | MSe Upside\nMethod Cap Rate Case\nAverage\n\nSource: Company Data, Morgan Stanley Research estimates\n\nExhibit 12:\nTraditional managers trade at a 15.4x FY2 P/E multiple with average\nnet flows of just +1% during that time period\nCovered Trad.

While surprisingly few others dropped him, the Clinton’s did, an irony of the present\ntabloid interest in Epstein’s old address book with its many Clinton contacts. And his sex offender status has\ntransformed him from libertine playboy to sex offender in tabloid parlance.\n\nWhile he has regularly entertained PR proposals aimed at his public rehabilitation, until Friends prodded him,\nand until this recent renewed tabloid fever, Epstein had concluded that he was perfectly satisfied living behind\nhigh walls and in his own exclusive club. Even the recent Dershowitz-Prince Andrew chapter seems like a\nparallel disturbance rather than something that is actually affecting him. His friends are as loyal as one could\nonly hope for . In speaking to quite a few, without exception they stand behind their trust and like a christain\nchorus, all say , if you only knew the real story. but Jeffrey has not made any public statements But true or not,\nthe story has taken on a life of its own, with the US and British tabloid press continuing, so far unsuccessfully,\nto search for a smoking gun connecting Clinton to underage girls, which could have—many obviously\nhope—the effect of derailing the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.\n\nIt is a curious attribute of his character that, other than perhaps being more circumspect about what legal advice\nto follow, Epstein would have done little differently. (When I suggested recently to Epstein that one obvious\nway to blunt the animus bearing down on him would be to get married, he said he’d rather go back to jail.) His\nlife, living it as he wants, seems to him to be an extraordinary accomplishment. Being on the wrong side of a\ngroups morality, custom, politics, the media, that’s just a bit of bad luck.\n\nAnd it is perhaps this attitude of his that irks his critics the most. Although he has spent more than a year in jail\nand paid out what may be as much as $20 million, he yet seems somehow to have not been damaged as they\nwould prefer. -thats worst sin of all. He is the unrepentant catchall of up-to-the-minute badness: the financier\nwhose wealth is a product of Wall Street math rather than work; arich good looking ,white man who not only\nparades his wealth and entitlement, but has a Peter Pan complex to boot; an insistent playboy (excuse me, sex\noffender ) in a correct and prudish world—someone who somehow didn’t get the memo about vast changes in\nmores and culture.\n\nBut Epstein’s friends—and I think that is, in the end, the best word for the powerful people who orbit him—are\nwilling to support him and are willing to expound on his virtues. Generous philantroppy, science funding at\nhe highest levels and a freedom of discourse that borders on dissent but often is the inspiration for great ideas. .\nEpstein is their sole confidant in many instances, Not the only nexus of them, but one of them. Dr. Epstein.\nmay i Lay on your couch. This is the back and forth, the power loop. His expertise is knowing what other\npeople want to know, combined with a lightning fast mind . Which surely offers those who are a part of the\nconversations a unique sense of confidence that they too now can understand how the world of money works.\nAnd ina time of such radical flux and existential instability, everybody wants to seek out someone who might\nhave some answers or at least make you feel like he does—even, and maybe especially, the rich.\n\nIn the last days of my interviews with Epstein, he was called by a particular world-stage individual, among the\nrichest and most powerful—proudly louche himself—who, feeling out of his depth in a world of crashing oil\nprices and wild currency fluctuation, had come to believe he might benefit from some private tutoring.

Rather, Epstein seeks to pyramid one impermissible inference upon\nanother from his citation to these materials to support his otherwise unsubstantiated and non-verifiable\nconclusion that he had sufficient evidence to proceed with claims of wrongdoing against Edwards. In\ntruth, as reflected in Edwards’ deposition and his supplemental affidavit, he has no involvement in any\nfraud perpetrated by Rothstein (Edwards’ deposition of March 23, 2010 at 301-302; Edwards Affidavit\nattached to Statement of Undisputed Facts as Exhibit “N” at paragraphs 8-10, paragraph 20, paragraphs\n22-23; Exhibit “H” — Deposition of Scott Rothstein at pp. 62-63, 114, and 121-124). Therefore, any\nallegations relating to Rothstein’s activities simply have no bearing on the legitimacy of any of the claims\nagainst Edwards. Edwards could not have possibly “pumped” cases to investors when he never\nparticipated in any communications with investors. Rather, Edwards had a duty to his clients to zealously\npursue discovery to achieve a maximum recovery against Epstein. Edwards cannot be liable for taking\nappropriate action that his ethical duties as an attorney required. The evidence also reflects that Edwards\nfiled all three of his cases almost a year before he was hired by RRA or even knew Scott Rothstein\n(Edwards’ Affidavit, Exhibit “N” attached to Statement of Undisputed Facts). The language set forth in\nhis Complaints remain virtually unchanged from the first filing in 2008 and, as the evidence shows, the\nclaims asserted against Epstein from the outset were true. The citation to public documents is a\nconvenient ruse; Epstein was not only liable for the molestation of the clients of Brad Edwards, he was\nalso a serial molester of minors — even as young as twelve years of age (Exhibit “A” — Edwards’\nStatement of Undisputed Material Facts paragraphs 1-43; Exhibit “D” — Statement of Virginia Roberts pp.\n16-17). Epstein entered a plea of guilty to felony charges involving prostitution and the solicitation of a\nminor for the purposes of prostitution (Exhibit “E” — Deposition of Jeffrey Epstein, March 17, 2010, pp.\n101-103).

A year\nago we argued that the market deflation position was stretched and that there was\nroom for inflation surprises. Indeed, average inflation surprises in G1O economies have\nbeen increasing since then and are now Clearly in positive territory (Chart 32). Monetary\npolicy in G10 economies is the loosest it has even been, suggesting that global inflation\ncould continue rising (Chart 33). This is not necessarily bad news, as the threat of\ndeflation is now gone. However, inflation rather than deflation trades are likely to\nbecome an important driver in G10 FX.\n\nWe update a heatmap of inflation risks in G1O economies to determine how to position\nfor such risks in FX. We have discussed the methodology in Inflation and FX: What if the\ndog starts barking?. The idea is to rank currencies based on a number of early warning\ninflation indicators. Using equal weights, if most indicators point towards higher\ninflation for a currency, we take this to suggest that investors should go long, against a\ncurrency for which most indicators point towards deflation, both in relative terms.\n\nChart 32: G10 inflation surprises (average) Chart 33: G10 sum of spreads from Taylor rule\n\n40.0\n30.0\n20.0\n10.0\n0.0\n-10.0\n-20.0\n-30.0\n\nan-00\nan-01\nan-02\nan-03\nan-04\nJan-05\nan-06\nan-07\nan-08\nan-09\n\n2 2\nao S\n2 2\no ©®\nu u\n\nan-10\nan-11\nan-12\nJan-13\nan-14\nan-15\nan-16\nFeb-01\nFeb-02\nFeb-03\nFeb-04\nFeb-05\nFeb-06\nFeb-07\nFeb-08\nFeb-09\nFeb-10\nFeb-11\nFeb-12\nFeb-13\nFeb-14\nFeb:\nFeb:\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.\n\n16 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 Bankof America\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014746\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We thus see potentially strong\nopportunities for the private hospital operators, the health insurance providers\nand local pharmaceutical manufacturers.\n\n4. Animprovement in the availability of affordable housing for Saudi\nnationals: The Saudi housing shortage has been a persistent issue for the\ncountry; with the shortfall currently standing at an estimated 1.2mn units, in\nour view. Looking forward, we believe this shortfall will likely intensify given\nstrong demand formation. The NTP is seeking to introduce greater numbers of\naffordable housing units and greater availability of financing. Indeed, the\nministry of housing is looking to invest cUS$16bn in achieving these aims by\n2020. Whilst we do not believe these measures go far enough to fully resolve\nthe housing shortage, we nevertheless see material opportunities for Saudi real\nestate developers.\n\n5. Growth in telecom/fibre infrastructure: The NTP is seeking to greatly\nenhance connectivity in the country, largely through increased usage of\ninternet. Reflecting that, the government has pledged approximately USS$2bnn\nto significantly increase the availability of high speed FTTH networks in remote\nareas, increase mobile broadband coverage and density in urban centres\n(3G/4G) and allocate an increased amount of bandwidth to the mobile service\nproviders. We thus see significant volume growth potential for the telecom\nservice providers (particularly with regards to mobile data, where we see scope\nfor price increases). Furthermore, we expect much of the capital expenditure\nrequired to expand the FTTH and Mobile networks to be provided by the\nprivate sector, which in our view will accelerate the case to spin off their tower\nportfolios (as a method of funding capex expansions).\n\n6. Significant growth in downstream petrochemicals capacity and metals &\nmining: The NTP’s drive to diversify revenues away from the oil sector has\nseen it focusing on exports of non-oil commodities. In particular, we highlight\nthe significant investment it has earmarked for the downstream industries\nincluding petrochemicals and oil refining, as well as aggressively growing the\ncountry’s metal and mining operations (likely through national champion,\nMaaden). Examples include the expansion of the country’s base metals\nproduction (e.g. bauxite and phosphates) and the construction of an oils-to-\nolefins project. The further development of capital intensive industries also\nprovides some scope for Saudi Arabia to develop service industries and\nincrease local content provisions, in our view. These could be facilitated\nthrough joint-ventures with global service providers, who may consider\nmanufacturing plants in Saudi Arabia.\n\nHow to gain exposure to NTP themes\n\nIn reflection of the themes articulated above (and in the sections that follow), we\nhighlight the sectors and companies which have exposure to each of these themes in\nthe table below. The companies highlighted in green represent the companies which are\ncurrently Buy rated by our fundamental analysts and also fit in with our theme of\ngaining exposure to the NTP.\n\nOS merrill Lynch GEMs Paper #26|30June 2016 41\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016151\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Edmond de Rothschild has an outstanding track record, history\nand presence in European infrastructure, as well as being one of Europe’s most recognized financial advisors\nto the infrastructure market. We have developed deep expertise in the infrastructure sector and sought\nsecure, well-managed assets, generating stable, long-term returns for investors.\n\nWe have done so by initiating and backing two experienced and highly-respected managers in the industry,\nTIIC and BRIDGE. TIIC is an equity investor in transport and social infrastructure. BRIDGE is an infrastructure\ndebt provider. Both managers are covered in more detail below. Edmond de Rothschild has been heavily\ninvolved in the launch of the below funds, providing crucial support in fund structuring, due diligence,\ncapital raising, legal & compliance functions as well as the sound governance and ESG management across\nall funds. Partnering with TIIC and BRIDGE has enabled Edmond de Rothschild to build a strong franchise\nwithin infrastructure investments, complementing its overall Private Equity offering.

I am myself rather disappointed by the lack of skepticality of this community. As I said, I have read\nnumerous reports of orgies on Jeffrey’s island involving me and other scientists during our meetings.. Orgies\nthat never happened. I am VERY skeptical of other claims on his behavior. I am defending Jeffrey for 2\nreasons: (1) Based on my knowledge and experience I am skeptical of the claims in the media and of those who\nhave settled claims for money... namely I don’t believe the published details just like I tend to be skeptical of\nmany published details on the internet.. I don’t believe Jeffrey did what has been claimed, and unless I see hard\nevidence, I will trust my own judgement here, and (2) Jeffrey went to prison, and I happen to believe that\nhaving served time, even those who questioned his behavior should be willing to give him the benefit of the\ndoubt, again until proved otherwise, that he is working hard to live a good life and do good things. I for one am\ndisgusted that people eat up the salacious nonsense they read on the web and then jump to conclusions about\nthings and people they do not know.. I do not jump to condemn people, especially when it concerns their sexual\npreferences. [DO NOT CONDONE sex with young girls, or young boys for that matter.. because there are real\nvictims there.. Until I know all the facts however, I do not jump to conclusions, and I am sorry, having seen the\nmedia frenzy around Jeffrey, and having seen the shoddy behavior of those who have attacked him, I remain\nskeptical, and I support a man whose character I believe I know..

Graydon Carter, in his second year as editor of\nVanity Fair, was also at the dinner. Epstein’s rise and Carter’s rise are not, with a little critical interpretation,\nthat different. Both are a function of the age of new money, both are helped by strategic relationships with the\nexceptionally wealthy, both have made themselves up. To say that Epstein, in the company of the Princess,\nstuck in Carter’s craw would be an understatement. Epstein became one of the “what do you know about him”\nfigures in Carter’s gossip trail—a story waiting to happen. Carter once advised me not to go to Epstein’s house\nor accept a ride in his car least I risk being put under his spell, . (“For what?” I asked Carter. “You can’t even\nbegin to imagine,” said Carter.)\n\nHe joined the board of Rockefeller University. And then he was suddenly on the Trilateral commission, that\ncabal of business people who are fancied by some conspiracy buffs, as the group running the world. He\nbought, from his client Limited Founder Les Wexner, the largest private house in Manhattan. He bought an\nairplane. Then another. He expanded his holdings in New Mexico. He began a Xanadu-like refurbishment of\nhis Caribbean Island and then bought the neighboring island for guests.\n\nHe befriended Bill Clinton in his new after-office life—and that would prove to be quite the fatal pairing.\n\nThe post-Monica Clinton, now having pardoned the on-the-lam financier Marc Rich—at this point, before\nhis own rehabilitation, Clinton was considered the world’s ultimate sleaze ball—was suddenly being ferried\naround in the jet of...who exactly? The New York Post was the first to take formal media note of the Clinton-\nEpstein connection, hinting at a sex and money bromance. “I suppose travel with Clinton changed the arc of my\nlife,” Epstein tells me. “There were, I knew, lots of obvious reasons not to do it, but having the ability to spend\n100 hours with a former president just doesn’t happen to many people.”\n\nI met Epstein around this time, on the flight out to TED. Not long after this trip, Epstein’s assistant called to\ninvite me for tea at his house in New York, where Epstein, with what seemed to me a dearth of understanding\nof the subject, began to ask me about detailed and focused questions re media—the upside, downside, and\nnature of media coverage. (Epstein’s very brief flirtation with the media would result in his backing an\nunsuccessful effort, of which I was a part, to buy New York Magazine in 2004.)\n\nNew York magazine was then soliciting him for a profile, as was Vanity Fair, who had assigned the British\ntabloid journalist, Vicki Ward, to the job. Both profiles—New York’s by Landon Thomas—pivot on the\nClinton connection and detail the same quandary, how a man without clear institutional bona fides nevertheless\nachieved such magnificent wealth and substainal influence. Epstein, sensing that he might be exposing\nhimself, called Carter and said he was having second thoughts about being a public figure.\n\n_ “Then you should have lived in a two bedroom apartment in Queens,” responded Carter.\n\n‘stp: And then the real troubles began. Epstein had a prodigious massage parlor outcall habit especially in Palm\nBeach with its many “Jack Shacks.” After Epstein’s round of publicity and widely touted association with\nClinton, the stepmother of one of the massage parlor girls who went to Epstein’s house called the police. The\npolice interviewed the girl—who was TK at the time, but whose website identified her as 18—and the girl\nsupplied the names of other girls, some of whom were also younger than 18.\n\nIn the end, the police tracked down 18 girls—nine of whom were under 18; the others were in their 20s and\n30s (one woman was in her 60s)—a number of whom gave statements describing happy-ending massages.\n(Although the nature of the allegations will dramatically grow into threesomes and forced sexual encounters,\nnobody at this point alleged anything more than this.)\n\nEpstein called in Dershowitz, who flew into Palm Beach to put the local authorities in their place—alienating\nPalm Beach officialdom—and, further amping up the profile of the case, also brought in Roy Black, the famous\ncriminal attorney who defended William Kennedy Smith in his rape trial in Palm Beach.\n\nThe release by the Palm Beach authorities of the depositions by the 18 girls describing the incremental details\nof the sex acts, the timing of the charges coming just after Rush Limbaugh’s high profile Palm Beach drug bust,\nthe Clinton connection and then with the sudden interest of the Bush FBI in the case, moved the case from\nsolicitation to scandal, and a plea deal with a sentence of 18 months.\n\nHe got out of jail in 2010, serving 13 months, of incarceration and then 12 months of house arrest and moved\nmostly seamlessly back into his life, to the shock-shock of tabloids whenever they are reminded of his existence\n(notably, when Epstein’s payment of Fergie’s debts slipped out, likely leaked by Fergie herself).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023632\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But, at the same\ntime, should we permit China or Germany to force another nation into its trading\nregime? It’s biological or cyber networks?

But we should be realistic. There’s much\nwe can’t deter. And the cost of attack is awfully cheap. We won't be truly safe\nwithout battle plans and diplomatic gambits that can hammer at the topological and\nreal world vulnerabilities of our enemies.

Programs that fail to make a difference — like many of those that train \nworkers for new jobs — endure indefinitely. Often, policy makers don't even know which work and which \ndon't, because rigorous evaluation is rare in government. And competition, which punishes laggards in the \nprivate sector, is typically absent in the public sector. \nBut there is some good news on this front. Lately, both American and British policy makers have been thinking \nabout how to bring some of the competitive discipline of the market to government programs, and they have hit \non an intriguing idea. \nDavid Cameron's Conservative government in Britain is already testing it, at a prison 75 miles north of London. \nThe Bloomberg administration in New York is also considering the idea, as is the State of Massachusetts. \nPerhaps most notably, President Obama next week will propose setting aside $100 million for seven such pilot \nprograms, according to an administration official. \nThe idea goes by one of two names: pay for success bonds or social impact bonds. Either way, nonprofit groups \nlike foundations pay the initial money for a new program and also oversee it, with government approval. The \ngovernment will reimburse them several years later, possibly with a bonus — but only if agreed-upon \nbenchmarks show that the program is working. \nIf it falls short, taxpayers owe nothing. \nThe first British test is happening at Her Majesty's Prison Peterborough, where 60 percent of the prisoners are \nconvicted of another crime within one year of release. Depressingly enough, that recidivism rate is typical for a \nBritish prison. \nTo reduce the rate, a nonprofit group named Social Finance is playing a role akin to venture capitalist. It has \nraised about $8 million from investors, including the Rockefeller Foundation. Social Finance also oversees three \nsocial service groups helping former prisoners find work, stay healthy and the like. If any of those groups starts \nto miss its performance goals, it can be replaced. \nFor the investors to get their money back starting in 2014 — with interest — the recidivism rate must fall at \nleast 7.5 percent, relative to a control group. If the rate falls 10 percent, the investors will receive the sort of \nreturn that the stock market historically delivers. \"It's been only a few months,\" says Tracy Palandjian, who \nrecently opened a new Social Finance office in Boston, \"but the numbers are coming in O.K.\" \nAntony Bugg-Levine of the Rockefeller Foundation told me it had invested in the project for two main reasons. \nOne, it expected to get its money back and then be able to reuse it. Two, if social impact bonds work, they have \nthe potential to attract for-profit investors — and vastly expand the pool of capital that's available for social \nprograms. \nClearly, social impact bonds have limitations. For starters, it's hard to see how private money could ever pay for \nmultibillion-dollar programs like Medicaid or education. \nJust as important, the execution of any bond program will be complicated. It will depend on coming up with the \nright performance measures, which is no small matter. Done wrong, the measures will end up rewarding \nprograms lucky (or clever) enough to enroll participants who are more likely to succeed no matter what. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030324 \nBut whatever the caveats about the bonds, the potential for improving the government's performance is \nobviously huge. That's true in education, health care, criminal justice and many other areas. \nA recent review found that 10 major social programs had been rigorously evaluated over the past two decades, \nusing the scientific gold standard of random assignment. Only one of the 10 — Early Head Start, for infants, \ntoddlers pregnant women — was a clear success. Yet all 10 still exist, and largely in their original form. \nJon Baron, the president of the Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy in Washington, points out that the social \nproblems addressed by antipoverty programs have not gotten much better in years. School test scores have \nbarely changed. College graduation rates for low-income students have stagnated. The poverty rate is as high as \nit was in 1981. Median household income is lower than it was in 1998. \n\"If we just keep funding social programs the way we have been,\" Mr. Baron says, \"there's not a lot of reason to \nthink we'll have much success.\" \nThe Obama administration's seven pilot programs would create bonds for, among other areas, job training, \neducation, juvenile justice and care of children's disabilities. Nonprofit groups like Social Finance could apply. \nSo could for-profit companies, said the White House official, who asked not to be named because the president \nhad not yet released next year's budget. The $100 million for the bonds would come out of the budgets of other \nprograms, to stay consistent with Mr. Obama's announced freeze on non-security spending. \nOfficials in Massachusetts and New York are looking at similar ideas but have not yet decided whether they \nwill issue bonds. \nBeyond the impact of any single program, the bonds have the potential to nudge all government agencies to pay \nmore attention to results. Mr. Obama, after all, campaigned as a reformer who wanted to create a sleek, efficient \n\"iPod government.\" He has had some success, like the expansion of a program — backed by years of solid  \nevidence — in which nurses go to the homes of new at-risk parents to counsel them. \nOver all, though, the administration has not done enough to improve government efficiency. Put it this way: If \nsomeone asked you how Mr. Obama had made government work better, would you have an answer? \nMaking government work better will be all the more important in the years ahead. The free market is not going \nto solve many of our biggest problems, be it stagnant pay or spotty medical care. And government — in \nWashington and locally — is going to be financially squeezed for a long time. \nThere never was a good excuse for wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on programs that didn't work. But now, \nespecially, there's no excuse. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030325 \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Wo/fe is also factually distinguishable from\nEdwards’ claims against Epstein. Wolfe involved a malicious prosecution action against attorneys.\nSeparate policy considerations might serve to impose additional limitations on the assertion of malicious\nprosecution claims against attorneys — against whom alternative remedies exist such as bar disciplinary\nproceedings. See Taylor v. McNichols, 243 P.2d 642 (Idaho 2010). Moreover, in light of the decisions in\nWright v. Yurko, supra and Olson v. Johnson, supra, the weight of authority supports the proposition that\nthe litigation privilege would not apply to malicious prosecution claims.\n\nBoth the Third and Fourth Districts have applied the litigation privilege to abuse of process\nclaims. However, Wolfe itself, and the decisions of the Third and Fourth Districts cited in Wolfe,\ninvolved the litigation privilege as applied to claims of abuse of process by attorneys. None of the cases\ninvolved the extraordinary actions of an individual party like Epstein who carried out a course of action\nagainst Plaintiff's counsel with a singular purpose unrelated to any legitimate judicial goal. Under the\ncompelling facts of this case, where the actions of Epstein are coupled with the elements of malice and\nabsence of probable cause arising from the unfounded filing of the claims against Edwards, the litigation\nprivilege should not have any applicability to the abuse of process claim asserted by Edwards.\n\nThere are Disputed Issues of Fact Precluding Summary Judgment on the Abuse of Process Claim\n\nAn abuse of process claim requires pleading and proof of the following three elements: 1) that the\ndefendant made an illegal, improper or perverted use of process; 2) that the defendant had ulterior\nmotives or purposes in exercising such illegal, improper, or perverted use of process; and 3) that, as a\n\nresult of such action on the part of the defendant, the plaintiff suffered damage.” See S&J Invs. v.

Kucherena’s disclosure that Snowden retained these crucial documents did not contradict\nSnowden’s own story at the time of the Shevardnadze interview. Indeed, it was completely\nconsistent with the statement Snowden made three weeks after arriving in Russia in his previously-\nmentioned email to Senator Humphrey.\n\nSnowden subsequently changed his story. In mid-October, Snowden electronically-informed\njournalists that he had destroyed all the NSA documents in his possession before flying to\nMoscow. So his new story radically contradicted what his own lawyer had said the previous\nmonth on television.\n\nTo be sure, Kucherena who later confirmed the accuracy of the Shevardnadze interview to me in\nMoscow in 2015 may have meant to say that Snowden only had access to the NSA documents\nrather than having the physical files in his possession. It is certainly possible that Snowden\ntransferred the NSA files from his own computers and thumb drives to storage on a remote server\nin the so-called “cloud” before coming to Russia. The “cloud” is actually not in the sky but a\nterm used for remote storage servers, such as those provided by Drop Box, Microsoft, Google,\nAmazon and other Internet companies. Anyone who is connected to the Internet can store and\nretrieved files by entering a user name and a password. For Kucherena to be certain Snowden\nhad access to this data, Snowden must have demonstrated his access either to him or the\nauthorities. The Russians therefore also knew Snowden had the means to retrieve this data. Since\nthe data concerned electronic espionage against Russia, the FSB had every reason to ask him to\nshare his user name and password. If Snowden had encrypted these files, it would also ask for his\nencryption key. And the FSB is not known to take a no for an answer in issues involving\nespionage.\n\nEven if Snowden refused to furnish his key, it would not present an insurmountable barrier for\nthe FSB. Snowden may have had confidence in the power of his encryption protocols but,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020290\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

A\nwhole freshly demanded language.\n\nIn all of human history only a few languages ever evolve to become honestly global\nin reach and influence - English now, French in the European centuries or Chinese\nin the Asian imperial era. But why English? Why not more decades of French?\nGerman? “Why a language becomes a global language has little to do with the\nnumber of people who speak it,” the British linguist and historian David Crystal has\nwritten. “It is much more to do with who those speakers are.” What made Latina\nglobal influential language wasn’t that millions of people spoke it, rather it was who\ndid: The elites at the very peak of 1,000 years of European power. What Latin had, in\na sense, was the ears and tongues of some of history’s most influential men.1°3 The\nprivate, technical language that connects the New Caste to their machines, to each\nother and to us is one of the sources of their power. Their code marks, like a trail,\nthe path to the cores of a vast and modern power apparatus.\n\nYou could, if you wanted, compare the New Caste a bit to an earlier generation of\nempire-deciding figures: Ocean explorers. Columbus, de Gama, Magellan. Backed by\na primitive version of venture capital, the “risk finance” of trading houses, these\ndiscovery captains had a hunger to test their certain masteries - navigation, sailing,\ntrade - against the uncertanties of geography, weather and luck. There was as much\nsheer nerve in these adventures as there was real knowledge. What lay five weeks’\nsailing time away from Cadiz? If you were willing to endure the difficulties, to\nbelieve in what might be out there - and your own ability to handle it - then fortune\nawaited. “Early intercontinental travelers not infrequently had to pay for access to\ndistant shores by enduring bitter asceticism,” the German philosopher Peter\nSloterdijk has written.!©* Months at sea, risks of ocean turmoil, starvation, endless\nboredom - all these sacrifices marked sailing adventure. But they knew the rewards\nfor areal mastery of the sea: Fame, riches, knowledge, adventure. Sloterdijk cites\nGoethe, who reflecting on the power of nautical life in 1787, defined the edgy\nadvantage of that ocean-mapping caste in his age: They had perspective. “No one\nwho has never seen himself surrounded on all sides by nothing but sea,” he wrote,\n“can have a true conception of the world and his own relation to it.”\n\n162 “The Egyptians”: Giambattista Vico, The New Science, (Cornell Press, 1948) 69\n163 What Latin had: David Crystal, English as a Global Language.

The Israeli side claimed that the Road Map called for security first—a\ncomplete end of Palestinian violence—before any negotiations could start. This strategy\nwas called sequentialism. The Palestinian side, and the international community at large,\nsupported a strategy of parallelism that called for progress on both security and political\nissues to happen in lock-step. The collision of the concepts of parallelism and sequenti-\nalism made it impossible to reach the final destination envisioned in the Road Map.\n\nWith gridlock in the formal negotiating process, civil society groups tried to take the\ninitiative. One example of several is the Geneva Accords of December 2003 led by PLO\nofficial Yasser Abed Rabbo and former Israeli Minister Yossi Beilin.\n\nThe stalemate in the process continued until Ehud Olmert’s election as Prime\nMinister in 2006. Through intense negotiations facilitated by US Secretary of State\nCondoleezza Rice and her team, the parties came close to striking a deal which would\nhave pushed the peace process forward. However, as the end game of this phase of the\nnegotiations, also known as the Annapolis process, unfolded, Prime Minister Olmert\nhad to step down because of an indictment for alleged financial misconduct. At the\nsame time also, a new wave of rockets emanating from Gaza, lead to a military\noperation in the Strip (Operation “Cast Lead’).\n\nThe scene and characters changed in early 2009 with the election of Barack Obama\nas President of the United States, and Benjamin Netanyahu as Prime Minister of Israel\nfor a second time. Shortly after his inauguration, President Obama attempted to\nresuscitate the peace process with the appointment of a new high-level special envoy,\nSenator George Mitchell. An absolute freeze on settlements, including in Jerusalem,\nwas made a precondition for bringing the parties to the table. This turned out to be a\nself-defeating proposal. For any Israeli Prime Minister, such a major move could only\nbe the result of, and not the pre-condition for, negotiations.\n\nDuring this paralysis, the Palestinian leadership looked for alternative ways of\nmoving forward, and shifted their strategy from bilateralism to unilateralism through\na bid to upgrade the Palestinian status to be on a par with the Vatican at the United\nNations: that of an observer Member State in the General Assembly. This quest reached.\nits climax during the UN General Assembly sessions of 2011 and 2012. In a speech to\nthe General Assembly in September 2011, President Abbas called for admission of\nPalestine as a Member State of the United Nations. It reflected the growing frustration\namong the Palestinian community with the lack of progress since the end of the\nAnnapolis process in 2008. In December 2012, the Palestinians were granted, with a\nlarge majority, state observer status at the UN.\n\nON PART III: UNITED NATIONS DOCUMENTS\nON THE QUESTION OF PALESTINE\nAn accurate picture of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict must include an understanding\nof the role of the United Nations.

For example,\nobserving pain in likable others (1.e.,\nthose who played a game fairly) resulted\nin an enhancement of empathic brain\nresponses, whereas pain in dislikable\nothers who played unfairly did not.\nAnother functional MRI study (10)\nfound that participants showed\nsignificantly greater responses in neural\nregions that are involved in pain\nperception when observing the pain of\npeople who were not responsible for\ntheir stigmatized condition (i.e.,\nindividuals who contracted AIDS as the\nresult of a blood transfusion) than either\ncontrols (healthy individuals) or people\nwho were held responsible for their\ncondition (i.e., those who contracted\nAIDS through illegal drug use). In\naddition, participants expressed more\nempathy and personal distress in\nresponse to the pain of people who were\nnot responsible for their stigmatized\ncondition as compared to controls. The\n\nPage |90\n\nlevel of empathic response, therefore,\nseems to be influenced by motivational\nfactors as well as the interpersonal\nrelationship between the target and the\nobserver.\n\nAltogether, these findings\ndemonstrate that the similarities between\naffective representations of the self and\nthe other stem from shared neural\ncircuits that can be emulated either\nautomatically or intentionally by the act\nof perspective-taking. Importantly, these\nfindings also point to some distinctions\nbetween these two representations,\ndistinctions that contribute to our\ncapacity to detach ourselves from others\nsufficiently to make considered\nresponses to their pain.\n\nConclusion\n\nEmpathy, the natural capacity to\nshare, appreciate, and respond to the\naffective states of others, plays a crucial\nrole in much of human social interaction\nfrom birth to the end of life. As would be\nexpected if empathy functions to\nenhance social cohesion, social non-\nhuman primate species also exhibit\nrudimentary versions of empathy. What\nhumans have in abundance are higher-\nlevel cognitive and social abilities\n(language, theory of mind, executive\nfunctions) that can be deployed to\nmodulate empathic responses, and that\nare amenable to modulation by lower-\nlevel processes such as emotional\ncontagion and mimicry. These levels of\nprocessing enable empathy to have an\nimpact on a wide variety of human\nbehaviors. From motivating prosocial\nbehavior to providing the affective and\nmotivational bases for moral\ndevelopment, empathy is an invisible\nforce to reckon with when considering\nhow humans behave toward each other.\n\nReferences\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021336\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Our spread target of 170bps is based on our benign economic outlook, ongoing investor\nappetite for income-generating assets and expected negative net issuance. This target spread is still above\nits 15-year average of 130bps.\n¢ Non-financial corporates: While total yields are at record lows, the pickup over government bonds and\nmoney market rates is attractive. Aggressive re-leveraging by companies looks unlikely in the current\nenvironment. Credit quality should remain good and non-financials continue to deliver a stable income.\ne Financial corporates: Due to regulatory challenges, spreads are expected to remain above past averages.\nTotal returns could outpace non-financials, but volatility will be considerably higher.\n¢ Overall, IG corporate bonds remain a preferred asset class, providing an attractive yield pickup. The asset\nclass offers relatively low volatility and a benign total return outlook. We expect lower-rated issuers (BBB\nand A) to outperform higher-rated ones.\n\nA Positive scenario Spread target (6-month): 140bps\n¢ Global growth accelerates more forcefully than expected. This could compress spreads to closer to pre-\ncrisis levels. Soreads for Financials are likely to remain elevated due to regulatory challenges. However, in\nthis positive case, rising benchmark yields would limit total returns to 1-2% over six months.\n\n& Negative scenario Spread target (6-month): 400bps\ne Even if US economic growth falters, and the European recession turns out to be worse than currently\nexpected, we believe we would be unlikely to see the spread levels reached in 2009, given companies’\nsuperior balance sheet positions.

What had begun\nas a problem of “artificial intelligence” became, in the end, a puzzle of mathematics.\nThe mystery of human thought, that great unknowable sea of chemicals and instinct\nand experience that would have let you place your finger on just the song to open\nthe heart of your date, had been unlocked by data. Here was the “Disappearing Al\nProblem.” A puzzle that looked like it needed computer intelligence demanded, in\nthe end, merely math. The AI had disappeared.\n\nFor several decades this accidental digital magic trick - “Hey, where'd the AI go?!” -\nbedeviled machine intelligence. It gave the entire thinking machines enterprise a bit\nof an occultish flavor. Many problems that once seemed to demand the miracle of\nthought really only needed data. The human was still doing the thinking; the\ncomputer was simply computing. It was extremely easy to draw a line between\nwhere the human ended and the machine began. This was a puzzle that had been, in\na sense, anticipated at the very dawn of the digital revolution by the mathematician\nAlan Turing in a 1950 paper called “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” that he\npublished in the British journal Mind. “Can machines think?” Turing began.?5” His\nidea was to test this question in the following way: Have a research subject - a\nsecretary, a graduate student, anyone - chat with an invisible interlocutor by way of\na keyboard. Then ask: What are you connected to? Another human? A machine?\n\nTuring figured you could call a machine “artificially intelligent” if it could fool a user\ninto thinking it was human. “Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth\nBridge,” Turing suggested a tricky user might ask. What computer could possibly\nknow about this famous Scottish landmark; to say nothing of being able to rhyme\n“Forth”? When the response came back, “Count me out. 1 could never write poetry,”\nyou'd think that sounded awfully human. “Add 34957 to 70764,” Turing suggested\nyou might fire back. Say the computer pauses. Then, thirty seconds later, “105621.”\nAre you dealing with a clever machine here? A dim, honest, slow-multiplying\nhuman? Impossible to tell. The distinction between machine and man blurred a bit.\n\nBuried in the very premise of Turing’s test was an assumption about what machines\ncould do, and how they might do it. “The idea behind digital computers may be\nexplained by saying that these machines are intended to carry out any operations\nwhich could be done by a human computer,” Turing said. His smart machines would\nbe tuned by humans to do human tasks, in a human sort of way. Write poetry. Do\nmath. His test of artificial intelligence was designed to figure out ifa computer could\nthink like a human. You and | might be able to spot patterns in movie habits given\nenough time, but as more complex problems emerge, as a world of a trillion\nconnected points becomes a sea of data to examine, there is no chance we'll match\nthe machines. This opened a then nearly unimaginable possibility: What if, some\nday, a computer could think better than a human. Could, in a nanosecond, come back\nwith that elusive rhyme for “Forth”: North. For such a machine, passing Turing’s\nTest — thinking like a human - was an interesting challenge. But more interesting\n\n257 “Can machines think”: A. M.

That made my first visit to see\nPresident Clinton as Prime Minister especially important.\n\nIt was billed as a “working visit” and work we did. After a gala dinner for Nava\nand me in the White House, we helicoptered to the presidential retreat at Camp\nDavid. President Clinton and I spent more than 10 hours discussing shared security\nchallenges in the Middle East, especially terrorist groups and states like Iran that\nwere backing them, and, of course, how best to move forward our efforts to\nnegotiate peace. These face-to-face meetings set a pattern that would last\nthroughout the time he and I were in office.

He had only a limited time left in office, and I\nwas determined that we not waste it. Much is often made about the personal\n“chemistry” in political relationships. Too much, I think, because the core issues,\nand the trade-offs of substance, are what truly matter when negotiating matters of\nthe weight, and long-term implications, of Middle East peace. Still, chemistry does\nhelp when moments of tension or crisis arise, as they inevitably do. My first few\ndays with President Clinton laid a foundation that allowed us to work together even\nwhen things got tough. I benefited, I’m sure, simply by not being Bibi.

The critique is profoundly misplaced, supported neither by the law or the facts, \nnor by the structure of our constitutional republic. To the contrary, Jeffrey was subjected to an unprecedented \nfederal intrusion into a quintessentially local criminal matter in south Florida. His offense to the social order --\ninvolving sex for hire -- was entirely a matter entrusted to laws of the several States, not the federal \ngovernment. His conduct -- a classic state offense --was being treated exactly that way by able, honest \nprosecutors in Palm Beach County, but the overweening federal government intruded where it did not \nbelong. And now, over ten years after the fact, the current assault on federal decision-makers at the time, \nincluding now-Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta (then the United States Attorney in south Florida), condemns \nthe federal authorities for not going far enough. \nThe critics are entirely wrong. Neither the facts nor the law support the misguided criticisms being leveled by \njournalists and politicians at federal officials from over a decade ago -- including the highest levels of the \nJustice Department in Washington, D.C.. \nHere are the key facts: Jeffrey Epstein, a successful self-made businessman with no prior criminal history \nwhatever, engaged in illegal conduct that amounts to solicitation of prostitution. That was wrong, and it was \nreasonably viewed as a violation of Florida state law. Although no coercion, violence, alcohol, drugs and the \nlike were involved, the unsavory facts were carefully assessed by experienced state prosecutors who \naggressively enforce state criminal laws. No one turned a blind eye to potential offenses to the public \norder. To the contrary, the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office conducted an extensive 15-month \ninvestigation, led by the chief of the Sex Crimes Division. Mr. Epstein was then indicted by a state grand jury \non a single felony count of solicitation of prostitution. \nDuring that intense investigation, the state prosecutors extensively gathered and analyzed the evidence, met \nface-to-face with many of the asserted victims, considered their credibility -- or lack thereof -- and considered \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030318 \nthe extent of exculpatory evidence. Then, after months of elaborate negotiations, the state prosecutors believed \nthey had reached a reasoned resolution of the matter that vindicated the public interest -- a resolution entirely \nconsistent with that of cases involving other similarly-situated defendants. \nThen, in came the feds. The United States Attorney's Office tried, to no avail, to fit Mr. Epstein's situation into \nits vision of what it viewed as a commercial trafficking ring targeting minors. This was anything but. At long \nlast, the federal authorities acknowledged that stark reality and grudgingly agreed to defer prosecution to the \nstate. But there was a huge catch. In the face of our arguments sharply condemning their overreach, the \nfederal prosecutors insisted on many unorthodox requirements that tugged at fundamental values of due \nprocess. For example, the agreement required Mr. Epstein to pay an undisclosed list of asserted victims \n$150,000 each. Even more, the feds insisted that Jeffrey pay for an attorney to represent such unidentified \nvictims if any chose to filed civil litigation against him. When asked what possible legal authority supported \nthis extravagant exercise of national power, the feds lamely cited a wildly inapposite case from Alaska \ninvolving cocaine and forced on-the-street prostitution. Apples and oranges. \nUnder the federally-forced deal, Jeffrey was sentenced to jail. That would not have been the case under the \nagreed-upon state disposition of this non-violent, consensual commercial arrangement. Jeffrey complied, \nserved that sentence, and in the process was treated exactly the same as other state-incarcerated \nindividuals. His conduct was exemplary, and so characterized by the state custodial authorities. He continued \nhis work, including his many philanthropic efforts. \nOur friend Jeffrey Epstein has paid his debt to society. He has also paid out millions of dollars to the asserted \nvictims and their highly-creative lawyers. For over ten years, he has lived an exemplary life, including \ncarrying on his wide-ranging philanthropies. Those of us who represented him in the Florida proceedings -- for \ncustomary professional fees -- now count him as a trusted friend. \nOur nation faces vitally important challenges, many involving the treatment of women and basic human \ndignity. Voices are rightly being raised speaking truth to power, especially about women in the \nworkplace. But Jeffrey, an exemplary employer, has long since been called to account by the criminal justice \nsystem for his misdeeds of yesteryear. In the spirit of the bedrock American belief in second chances, that \nunhappy chapter in Jeffrey's otherwise-magnificent life should be allowed to close once and for all. \nOn Thu, Dec 13, 2018 at 4:24 PM J <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nken ,would take a stab at the article for the law journal. ? thx \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

The Act was intended to halt those corrupt practices, create a level\n\nplaying field for honest businesses, and restore public confidence in the integ-\n\nrity of the marketplace.\n\nThe FCPA contains both anti-bribery and accounting\nprovisions. The anti-bribery provisions prohibit US. per-\nsons and businesses (domestic concerns), U.S. and foreign\npublic companies listed on stock exchanges in the United\nStates or which are required to file periodic reports with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (issuers), and\ncertain foreign persons and businesses acting while in the\nterritory of the United States (territorial jurisdiction) from\nmaking corrupt payments to foreign officials to obtain or\nretain business. The accounting provisions require issuers\nto make and keep accurate books and records and to devise\nand maintain an adequate system of internal accounting\ncontrols.

(HF were down 1.9% in May 2012 vs MSCI world at -8.5%)\n\n¢ Decelerating global growth prospects, the next leg in the ongoing Eurozone crisis, is challenging mostly\nequity long-short managers, who are net-long the market. While event-driven managers share some of\nthe performance drivers, idiosyncratic bets (event) reduce the exposure to markets. The real reason to own\nthis strategy, however, is the potential for out-sized return in distressed, high yield and other credit\ninvestments as the Eurozone crisis plays out. The inherent hedging in relative-value should remain\nappealing. Credit relative-value managers should perform well in this environment of higher fixed income\nvolatility and increasing pricing anomalies created by central bank interventions (OT2) and limited\ncompetition.\n\nA Positive scenario Prefer Equity long-short\n\n¢ A reduction of uncertainty (e.g. resolution in Europe) lowers equities' correlation and volatility. This\nhelps bottom-up fundamental analysis and equity long/short managers the most. Also, CEOs will likely\nmake more corporate transactions that can be monetized by event-driven managers, and a clearer\nmacroeconomic environment with more persistent trends would be supportive for macro managers\n\nNegative scenario Prefer Trading (Global Macro + CTA)\ne A 2011-type scenario in which hedge fund managers get whipsawed through the year with risk-on and\nrisk-off circumstances, driven by a multitude of political interventions, is difficult to anticipate. That would\nimpact long-short managers, event-driven, and to a lesser extent global macro managers.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\nGlobal equity direction The outlook for global equities becomes an important HF performance driver.\n/ economic cycle The economic cycle impacts the strategies differently.\n\nCorrelation Correlation among pair-stocks; an important performance/alpha driver for\nequity long/short, the largest HF strategy by assets under management.\n\nLeverage Gross and net leverage are key to monitoring risk.\n\nVolatility The direction influences certain HF strategies (e.g. convertible arbitrage).\n\nLiquidity Particularly for large HF that are less nimble to enter and exit their strategies\n\nRegulation Volcker's rule, USCITS III/IV\n\n36 UBS\n\nRecommendations\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\nActive risk management is instrumental for\ncapital preservation during adverse market\nconditions. At the moment, we therefore\nfavor relative value and event-driven\nstrategies, since they are less hinged to\nequity markets and other risky assets than\ntrading is.\n\nValue proposition: Hedge funds should\nachieve robust performance over an\nextended horizon, while displaying limited\nvolatility vis-a-vis equities and other risky\nassets, in general. Hedge funds minimize\ndownside losses in adverse market\nconditions (e.g. active risk management)\nand play a crucial role in wealth\nappreciation, since there is less ground to\nregain in the recovery phase and\nultimately greater chances for superior\nlong-term returns.\n\nPerformance (year-to-date)\n\nRelative value\n\nEvent driven\n\nEquity hedge\n\nHedge Funds\n\nTrading\n\n1.0% 0.5% 0.0% 05% 1.0% 1.5% 20% 25% 3.0% 3.5% 40%\n\nSource: HFRI, UBS CIO, as of 18 June 2012\n\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\n40\n\nFor further information please contact CIO's asset class specialist Cesare Valeggia, cesare.valeggia@ubs.com\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024175\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This was about the last thing a new state needed. “Poetry mustn't be\ntaken seriously as a serious thing laying hold of truth,” Socrates warns. “The man\nwho hears it must be careful, fearing for the regime in himself.” Thus: Hesiod’s\nmagnificent Works and Days, banned. Homer, banned. There has always been, about\npoetry, this sense of the magical, that it was a key to something intimately bound to\nthe human mystery. It was no surprise to me to find, when I went back to re-read\nTuring’s “Can Machines Think?” essay, that the very first thing the great\nmathematician dreamed up to ask a digital brain was: “Write me a sonnet.” Poetry\nhas always marked a test. Socrates and Plato gatekeep the poets out of their republic\nbecause they know the mad part of the soul verse can touch. It is hard to blame\nthem. After all, they were among the earliest Western minds to try to dispel\nmadness and superstition and sophistry. Without their logic and effort there would\nbe no Aristotle, no science, none of the sense of our world as a comprehensible\nmachine. The confidence to philosophize - which for them meant also to poke at the\npolitical wiring of our world - demanded the break from poetry and mysticism as a\nsource of action or legitimacy. Had they failed, we'd still be in the dark. But had they\ncompletely succeeded? We'd hardly be human.\n\nYou know, as I’ve said, when I first moved to China, there were so many things that\nbaffled me. (There still are, to be honest.) But very high on that list was a peculiarity\nof ancient Chinese political life. For thousands of years the greatest poets and\npainters had also been emperors and politicians. Su Dongpo, for instance, the official\nwho turned the lake city of Hangzhou into one of the great cultural centers of human\nhistory is also one of China’s best regarded poets. The calligraphy of the Qing\ndynasty Mingzhen Emperor is marked with a temprament of transcendent delicacy.\nIt’s not merely that we'd never seriously expect a Western political figure to make\ngreat art - or even to have interesting ideas or be able to write these days. It’s not\neven that many of the most significant Chinese political documents are paintings of\nmountains or rivers, that even letters from high officials are often rated as great art.\n\nMy first encounter with this strange mix, art and power mingled, produced a\npredictable Western reaction: It’s amazing how many “Renaissance Men” China had, |\nthought. These officials seemed to have mastered so many different talents. What I\ndid not understand was that these men had not, in fact, mastered many different\ntalents, at least not in any way I might understand it. They were not “Renaissance\nMen”, but actually a different breed, operating on a deeper level. They had mastered\none skill. This was the cultivation of a finely-tuned inner energy - an instinct\npowerful enough that it could be turned with equal ease to calligraphy or warfare.\nThis sort of effort took time. It demanded that knife-in-the-leg focus of Su Qin. And it\ndemanded faith that some sort of enlightenment would in fact take place. For this,\nthey had thousands of years of history as proof. Once this breakthrough to inner\nknowledge happened, once they developed a fine sensitivity to the underlying force\nof power, then they could tap into it for anything. Fighting wars. Counseling princes.\nFishing.

The mechanism is fairly simple: dirt is obtained from wherever it can be found to\ndiscredit an opponent. It is then “leaked,” usually either anonymously or on background, to targeted\nmedia channels. What makes the 2016 campaign particularly interesting from a counterintelligence\nperspective is not that both sides had their own disclosure operations, but that both sides were\noffered the dirt for them by a common source: Russian intelligence.\n\nAs we now know from the emails of Donald Trump Jr., a thinly veiled intermediary, Natalya\nVeselnitskaya, offered the Trump campaign documents that putatively would show that Hillary\nClinton had received illegal donations from Russian financiers; in the event, no such documents\nwere proffered. But it is a reasonable assumption that Veselnitskaya could not have made such an\noffer, especially in a meeting attended by three other Russians, unless the move was approved by\nthe FSB, the Russian security service.\n\nA second disclosure operation, this one involving supporters of the Clinton campaign, was more\nlayered. The proximate intermediary was Fusion GPS, a research firm used by the law firm Baker\nHostetler, and the secondary “cut-out” was the British firm Orbis, co-founded by former MI-6\nofficer Christopher Steele. We know something about this sub-contractor from the depositions\nSteele gave in defending a libel suit in London. According to Steele, Fusion GPS not only had him\nprepare the so-called “dossier” on Trump but also directed Steele to “leak” it to specified reporters\nat Mother Jones, Yahoo, the New York Times, the Washington Post, The New Yorker, and CNN. In\nsome cases, Steele was directed to brief the selected journalists personally. The dirt in these “leaks”\nrelied heavily on information supplied by two Russian government sources: Source A, whom Steele\ncalls “a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure”; and Source B, “a former top-level intelligence\nofficer still active in the Kremlin.” Sources A and B provided information supposedly exposing a\nlong-time Russian FSB operation to get compromising information that could be used to control\nTrump. The idea that two Russian intelligence sources would reveal a long-time Kremlin-backed\nFSB operation bears further examination.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025548\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Rev. 861, *962\n\nIt is important to emphasize one argument the Advisory Committee does not appear to make: that the CVRA applies only to\ncharged crimes. Any such argument would not only fly squarely in the face of the CVRA's venue and coverage provisions\napplying victims' rights against investigating agencies, but also of the CVRA's clear legislative history. Discussing the CVRA's\ndefinition of a crime victim, *°? Senator Kyl said the statute used an \"intentionally broad definition because all victims of\ncrime deserve to have their rights protected, whether or not they are the victim of the count charged.\" *°°\n\nAt least one federal magistrate judge has suggested, in dicta, that - in spite of Senator Kyl's plain statement - the CVRA might\nnot apply until charges have been filed. *°! His primary reason for doing so, however, was that the Supreme Court's decision in\nHughey v. United States, ©? suggested this result. To be sure, the victims statute at issue in Hughey (the Victim Witness\nProtection Act) did employ a similar definition of \"victim\" as that found in the CVRA. But Hughey turned on the fact that other\nlanguage in the restitution statute provided that \"\"a defendant convicted of an offense’ may be ordered to \"make restitution to\nany victim of such offense. > Such a straightforward holding says little about a statute - such as the \"fairness\" provision in\nthe CVRA - that contains no such limiting language regarding persons \"convicted ... of [an] offense.\" Moreover, the magistrate\njudge did not discuss the CVRA's coverage and venue provisions, which plainly dictate that the CVRA applies to crimes not yet\ncharged. For all these reasons, the [*963] Advisory Committee should apply the CVRA as written and include a venue\nprovision both for prosecuted and not-yet-prosecuted crimes.\n\nFifth, and most important, in proposed Rule 60(b)(2), the Advisory Committee gives victims the power to assert rights \"under\nthese rules.\" As has been noted throughout this Article, the Rules as they would be amended by the Advisory Committee leave\nout many of the victims' rights under the CVRA. For example, the victims right to a speedy trial has not been included in the\nproposed rule changes. >°* By giving victims the power to only assert the limited number of rights listed \"under these rules,\"\nthe Advisory Committee ignores many victims’ rights under the CVRA. At the very least, the language should be changed to\nmake clear that victims to assert all rights that they have under the CVRA.\n\nOne change that the Advisory Committee should not make is worth brief mention: The Advisory Committee should not add a\nprovision for a fact-finding hearing to determine whether someone is a \"victim\" of crime. In its comment on the pending\nproposed amendments, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (\"NACDL\") has proposed such a procedure.\nThe rationale it gives is that \"the conferring of \"rights' on the \"victim’ comes, in general, at the expense of the defendant. Thus,\ndue process requires that a provision be added to these Rules for a factfinding hearing, to be held whenever the proper labeling\nof a person as \"victim,’ is in dispute ... .\" °°\n\nThe NACDL's rationale is patently defective. The rights in the CVRA do not interfere with any rights of the defendant, as\npointed out throughout this Article. *©° For instance, for victims to be notified of court hearings, to attend those hearings, and\n\n559 See supra notes 117-133 and accompanying text (discussing amendments to Rule 1).\n\n560 150 Cong.

But: What are we to make of systems that work\nbetter when they are obscured from us? That we could never understand even if we\ncould see inside? Documents such as The Critical Engineering Manifesto, pulled\ntogether by a collection of uneasy designers and engineers, reflect anxieties that stir\neven inside the hearts of many in the New Caste. “The Critical Engineer considers\nengineering to be the most transformative language of our time,” the Manifesto\nbegins. “Each work of engineering engineers its user, proportional to that user’s\ndependency on it.” That is Conway’s or Wittfogel’s unsettling truth. The technical\nlayout of a social network, a medical diagnostic tool or a financial market affects\nhow we or our markets or our government (or our enemies) behave. We are, ina\nsense, being engineered by the damn opaque systems we are using.\n\nIn 1965 the MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum found himself, somewhat\nunexpectedly, considering this same problem. 175 Weizenbaum had written a\nprimitive computer program to perform what is now known as natural language\nprocessing, essentially a bit of code designed to translate what a user tells a\ncomputer into clear instructions. This is the work that converts your request to a\nmachine for weather updates into a query that can be turned into an answer.\nTeaching a computer to answer a question such as “it is it raining?” demands layers\nof logic and calculation.\n\nIn 1965, long before our era of simply talking to our phones or computers,\nWeizenbaum’s program was a revolutionary breakthrough.

Load your starship with 300,000 nucle-\nar bombs, detonate\none every three sec-\nonds, and ride the blast\nwaves. Though extreme,\nit works on the same\nbasic principle as any\nother rocket—namely,\nrecoil. Instead of shoot-\ning atoms out the back\nof the rocket, the nucle-\nar-pulse system shoots\nblobs of plasma, such as\nfireballs of tungsten.\n\nYou pack a plug of\ntungsten along with a\nnuclear weapon into a\nmetal capsule, fire the\ncapsule out the back of\nthe ship, and set it off\na short distance away.\nIn the vacuum of space,\nthe explosion does less\ndamage than you might\nexpect. Vaporized tung-\nsten hurtles toward the ship, rebounds off a thick\nmetal plate at the ship’s rear, and shoots into space,\nwhile the ship recoils, thereby moving forward. Giant\nshock absorbers lessen the jolt on the crew quarters.\nPassengers playing 3-D chess, or doing whatever else\ninterstellar passengers do, would feel rhythmic thuds\nlike kids yumping rope in the apartment upstairs.\n\nThe ship might reach a tenth the speed of light.\nIf for some reason—solar explosion, alien invasion\nwe really had to get off the planet fast and we didn’t\n\ncare about nuking the launch pad, this would be the\nway to go. We already have everything we need for\n\nit. “Today the closest technology we have would be\nnuclear pulse,” Matloff says. If anything, most people\nwould be happy to load up all our nukes on a ship and\nbe rid of them.\n\nIdeally, the bomb blasts would be replaced with con-\ntrolled nuclear fusion reactions. That was the approach\nsuggested by Project Daedalus, a ’70s-era effort to\ndesign a fully equipped robotic interstellar vessel. The\nbiggest problem was that for every ton of payload,\nthe ship would have to carry 100 tons of fuel. Such a\nbehemoth would be the\nsize of a battleship, with a\nlength of 200 meters and\na mass of 50,000 tons.\n\n“Tt was just a huge,\nmonstrous machine,”\nsays Kelvin Long, an Eng-\nlish aerospace engineer\nand co-founder of Project\nIcarus, a modem effort\nto update the design.\n“But what’s happened\nsince then, of course, 1s\nmicroelectronics, minia-\nturization of technology,\nnanotechnology. All these\ndevelopments have led\nto a rethinking. Do you\nreally need these mas-\nsive structures?” He says\nProject Icarus planned to\nunveil the new design in\nLondon in October 2013.\n\nInterstellar design-\ners have come up with all sorts of ways to shrink the\nfuel tank. For instance, the ship could use electric or\nmagnetic fields to scoop up hydrogen gas from inter-\nstellar space. The hydrogen would then be fed into a\nfusion reactor. The faster the ship were to go, the faster\nit would scoop—a virtuous cycle that, if maintained,\nwould propel the ship to nearly the speed of light.\nUnfortunately, the scooping system would also pro-\nduce drag forces, slowing the ship, and the headwind\nof particles would cook the crew with radiation. Also,\npure-hydrogen fusion 1s inefficient.

This integration\nrequires constant and dynamic changes\nto the brain structures that represent\nwhat we know and how we use it.'! One\nway this could happen is that when we\nperceive something new, we actually re-\nenact in our mind’s eye the previous\nrelated perceptions. For example, if we\nencounter an apple — having encountered\nmany previously -- perhaps we actually\nimagine (Seeing) one or more previous\napples or episodes involving apples, or\nimagine (performing) one or more\ninstances of biting an apple or throwing\none, and/or imagine tasting and smelling\none. We might also imagine hearing the\nword “apple”, producing the sounds of\nthe word, seeing the written form of the\nword, or even hearing, seeing, or\nproducing synonyms or related words in\nour first (e.g., “Granny Smith”) or\nsecond (e.g., “pomme”) languages. We\npropose that understanding an apple is\ntantamount to executing this entire set of\nprocesses, and thus, that the circuits for\nunderstanding are very complicated and\ntake up a large portion of the brain.\n\nOf course, not all of what we\nunderstand is directly available to the\nsenses; we can clearly understand beliefs\nand emotions as well as physical objects\nand overt actions. Brain researchers\ngenerally take the view that previous\nexperience guides understanding of\nabstract concepts in much the same way\nthat it guides the understanding of the\nmore concrete entities. For example, we\ncan understand the emotional states of\nother people by imagining being in those\nstates ourselves. When I see someone\nfeeling happy or sad, I can evoke\nexamples from my own previous\nexperience of feeling happy or sad\n(perhaps even for the same reasons), and\n\nPage | 76\n\nby feeling the emotion, I can understand\nit. The closer my previous experience is\nto the perceived one, the better the\n“understanding”. This principle holds\nwhether one is trying to understand\nobjects or people. An important\ndistinction between people and objects\nwhen trying to understand their actions\nis that people, but not objects, have\nintentions.\n\nThe Social Brain\n\nThe critical question for\nneurobiologists is how does the brain\nunderstand. In particular, we want to\nknow whether the same brain circuits\nthat are used when we experience things\npersonally are also used when we try to\nunderstand another person having the\nsame experiences, whether these\nexperiences are concrete, like grasping a\ncup or hitting a baseball, or more\nabstract like feeling sad or fearful or in\npain. We also want to know whether\nunderstanding the simple concrete\nperceptions and these highly complex\nemotional states are mediated similarly\nin the brain. Further, we are interested in\nthe overlap between conscious and\nunconscious understanding and shared or\npersonal understanding. One way to\naddress these questions is to examine the\nbrain structures responsible for specific\ntypes of personal sensations, actions, and\ncognitive processes, and to see if these\nsame ones play a role when individuals\nattempt to understand these functions in\nothers. Using modern techniques of\nphysiology, experiments of this type\nhave been conducted in both monkeys\nand humans, with some surprising\nresults.\n\nIt is now possible to measure\nbrain activity of humans while having a\nwide range of different kinds of\nexperiences.

They are the only ones who don’t realize it.” While he\nmight have sincerely persuaded himself that he was somehow helping US communications\nintelligence in a self-appointed role, those familiar with the activities of the Russian security\nservices find it inconceivable that he could escape their control in Russia. At the very minimum,\n\na former US intelligence worker who stole American state secrets, such as Snowden, would be\nunder the FSB’s scrutiny. Andrei Soldatov, the co-author of the 2010 book The New Nobility:\nthe Restoration of Russia's Security State and the Enduring Legacy of the KGB, and who was\npersonal knowledgeable about FSB procedures, explained the FSB would monitor “every facet of\nSnowden's communications, and his life.” General Oleg Kalugin, who, as previously mentioned,\ndefected from the KGB to the United States in 1995, added that the FSB following the standard\noperating procedures of the KGB, would be “his hosts and they are taking care of him.” Kalugin\nfurther said in 2014 that “Whatever he had access to in his former days at NSA, I believe he\nshared all of it with the Russians, and they are very grateful”\n\nAmerican intelligence officers knowledgeable about the operations of the FSB, agreed with\nKalugin’s assessment. General Hayden, for example, who served both as director of the NSA,\nCIA, and Air Force counterintelligence, told me in an interview that he saw no other possibility\nthan Snowden would be induced to cooperate in this situation, saying “I would lose all respect for\nthe Russian and Chinese security services if they haven’t fully exploited everything Snowden had\nto give.” They certainly had that opportunity at Sheremetyevo International Airport: He had\nalready, at least in the eyes of the Department of Justice, betrayed US secrets by stealing them and\ntaking them abroad. Snowden was held in limbo in the transit zone. The FSB controlled his\naccess to food, lodgings, the Internet, and whatever else he needed to survive there. It could also\nreturn him to the US if he did not cooperate. What recourse did Snowden have? The only party\nfrom whom he could seek redress was Putin’s regime. Russia’s leverage now would be even\ngreater than in Hong Kong. If Putin chose to fully apply it, would be all but irresistible over a\nfugitive who had literally no place else to go. In a word, the FSB held all the cards but\none—Snowden’s help with the stolen documents. Even if Snowden disliked the tactics of the\nRussian security services, his situation left him a powerful inducement now not to decline the\nrequests of the Russian authorities.\n\nTwo weeks after his arrival, the Russian authorities provided him with a convenient path to\nfull cooperation with Russia. He was put in contact with Anatoly Grigorievich Kucherena, a\nsilver-haired 53-year old lawyer, who was known as a personal friend of Putin. Kucherena also\ndid task for Putin’s party in the Russian parliament or Duma. Most important for Snowden,\nKucherena had excellent connections in the Russian security apparatus since he served on the\noversight committee of the FSB. He also offered to serve as the lawyer for Snowden pro bono.\nOn July 10, 2013, Snowden officially retained him as his legal representative in Moscow. From\nthat point on, he would act as Snowden’s go-between with the FSB and other Russian agencies.\n\nAt the outset, Kucherena made it clear to Snowden that he would have to play by Moscow’s\ntules before the Kremlin would grant him permission to stay in Russia.

Maybe even Joe Biden won't forget it the next time the U.S. \ntries to reach out diplomatically to Iran. \nWe're speaking of the Administration's latest effort to come to terms with \nTehran over its nuclear programs, which Mr. Biden made last weekend at \nthe Munich Security Conference. The U.S. offer of direct bilateral talks, \nhe said, \"stands, but it must be real and tangible.\" Iranian foreign minister \nAli Akbar Salehi, who was also at the conference though he refused to \nmeet with U.S. officials, called Mr. Biden's comments \"a step forward.\" \nMr. Salehi's remark set the usual hearts aflutter that Iran is finally serious \nabout a deal. But the optimism was brief On Thursday, Iran's Supreme \nLeader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei flatly rejected direct talks with the U.S. \n\"The U.S. is pointing a gun at Iran and wants us to talk to them,\" he said. \n\"Direct talks will not solve any problems.\" \nThis isn't the first time Mr. Khamenei has played chaste Daphne to \nPresident Obama's infatuated Apollo. Just after becoming President in \n2009, Mr. Obama sent the Ayatollah two private letters and delivered a \nconciliatory speech for the Persian new year of Nowruz. Mr. Khamenei's \nanswer: \"They chant the slogan of change but no change is seen in \npractice.\" He told a crowd chanting \"death to America\" that \"if a hand is \nstretched covered with a velvet glove but it is cast iron inside, that makes \nno sense.\" \nThat was in March 2009. In October of that year the U.S. and its allies \ntentatively worked out a deal with Iranian negotiators to move some of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027102 \ntheir enriched uranium outside Iran. Western analysts were confident that \nMr. Khamenei would give his blessing, given the international pressure he \nwas said to be under following the fraudulent elections and the bloody \ncrackdown that followed. \nThe Ayatollah quashed that deal too: \"Whenever they [Americans] smile \nat the officials of the Islamic revolution, when we carefully look at the \nsituation, we notice that they are hiding a dagger behind their back.\" \nIt was the same in January 2011, when diplomacy also collapsed. Ditto in \n2012, when negotiations in February, May and June each ended in failure. \nWashington went into those talks thinking they were going to succeed on \nthe theory that Tehran desperately wants relief from the supposedly \ncrippling pressure of economic sanctions. \nWhy does the Ayatollah keep saying no? The conventional wisdom is that \nprevious U.S. offers weren't generous enough, or that the wrong President \nwas in the White House, or that Iran wants only to deal directly with the \nU.S. and not in multilateral forums. Each of these theories has been tested \nand shown to be false. \nA more persuasive explanation—get ready for this shocker—is that Iran \nreally wants a bomb. The regime believes, not unreasonably, that \nMoammar Gadhafi would still be in power had he not given up his nuclear \nprogram in 2003. Mr. Khamenei also fears a \"velvet revolution\" scenario, \nin which more normal ties with the West threaten the ideological \nfoundations of the Islamic Republic. Confrontation with America is in this \nregime's DNA. \nMeantime, the pretense of negotiations has allowed Tehran to play for \ntime to advance its programs. When Mr. Obama took office, Iran had \nenriched 1,000 kilos of reactor-grade uranium. In its last report from \nNovember, U.N. inspectors found that Iran has produced 7,611 kilos to \nreactor grade, along with 232 kilos of uranium enriched to 20%, which is \nclose to bomb-grade. Last month, Iran declared that it would install 3,000 \nadvanced centrifuges at its Natanz facility, which can enrich uranium at \ntwo to three times its current rate. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027103 \nAs for the sanctions, they may hurt ordinary Iranians but this regime is \nfamously indifferent to the suffering of its own people. The Ayatollah also \ndoesn't seem to take the Administration's talk about \"all options being on \nthe table\" seriously. Mr. Obama's nomination of Iran dove Chuck Hagel to \nbe Secretary of Defense reinforces that impression, as do reports that the \nWhite House blocked Pentagon and CIA plans to arm the opposition that's \nfighting to overthrow Iran's client regime in Damascus. An America that \nwon't help proxies in a proxy war isn't likely to take the fight directly to \nIran's nuclear facilities. \nIn rejecting Mr. Biden's offer, the Ayatollah said frankly, \"I'm not a \ndiplomat; I'm a revolutionary.\" Another round of multilateral talks with \nIran is set to resume this month, but maybe Joe Biden and his boss should \nstart taking no for an answer. \nArticle 2. \nForeign Policy \nLet's face it: Obama's Iran policy is failing  \nJames Traub \nFebruary 8, 2013 -- There is no better example of an Obama \nadministration initiative that has succeeded on its own terms, and yet \nfailed as policy, than Iran. By engaging the regime in Tehran, and being \nrebuffed, the White House has been able to enlist China, Russia, and the \nEuropean Union in imposing tough sanctions on Iran. By steadily \nratcheting up those sanctions, the administration has been able to \ngradually squeeze the Iranian economy. By insisting that \"containment\" is \nnot an option, Obama has persuaded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin \nNetanyahu that he need not launch an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities --\nat least not any time soon. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027104 \nObama has done everything right, and yet his Iran policy is failing. There \nis no evidence that the sanctions will bring Iran to its knees and force the \nsupreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to accept the humiliation of \nabandoning his nuclear program. But neither is there any sign of new \nthinking in the White House. \"I don't see how what didn't work last year is \ngoing to work this year,\" says Vali Nasr, who served in the Obama State \nDepartment before becoming dean of the Johns Hopkins School of \nAdvanced International Studies. He might not get much of an argument \nfrom White House officials, who, the New York Times recently noted, \n\"seem content with stalemate.\" \nThe United States is not negotiating directly with Iran but rather doing so \nthrough the P5+1, which consists of the five permanent Security Council \nmembers and Germany. The P5+1's current position is that Iran must stop \nenriching nuclear fuel to 20 percent purity -- a point from which Iran \ncould quickly move to weapons-grade material -- transfer its existing stock \nof such fuel to a third country, and shut down one of its two enrichment \nfacilities, known as Fordow. In exchange, the parties will help Iran \nproduce such fuel for medical purposes, which the regime claims is its \nactual goal. Iran has refused, saying it will not shut down Fordow. \nBut the current state of play masks the larger issue, which is that the \nayatollah and those around him believe the United States wants to make \nIran cry uncle -- which happens to be true. The next round of P5+1 \nnegotiations, now scheduled for Feb. 25 in Kazakhstan, are almost \ncertainly not going to go anywhere unless the United States signals that it \nis prepared to make what the Iranians view as meaningful and equivalent \nmoves in exchange for Iranian concessions. Arms-control experts say that \nboth British Prime Minister David Cameron and Catherine Ashton, head \nof foreign affairs for the European Union, favor offering Iran a reduction \nin sanctions; but there's a limit to what they can do without the United \nStates. \nOf course, such flexibility would be pointless if Iran is simply hell-bent on \ngaining the capacity to produce a nuclear weapon. The signals, as always \nwith Iran, are cryptic. Iranian authorities have told nuclear inspectors that \nthey plan to install a new generation of centrifuges in order to accelerate \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027105 \nenrichment. And yet Iran also chose to convert some of its stockpile of \nhighly enriched uranium for medical use rather than approach the amount \nneeded for a bomb, leading Israeli authorities to predict that Iran wouldn't \nbe able to build a bomb before 2015 or 2016. Last week, Ali Akbar \nVelayati, Khamenei's foreign policy advisor, publicly criticized officials \nwho have treated the negotiations dismissively. Presumably, he was \nthinking of President Mahmoud Ahmadinej ad, who has compared Iran's \nnuclear program to a train without brakes. \nIran is now at the outset of what promises to be a raucous presidential \nelection, and may be no more capable of serious negotiations between now \nand June than the United States was in 2012. But what is clear is that the \nsanctions have moderated Iranian behavior and rhetoric. At the same time, \nas the Times also noted, the economic pressure is not nearly great enough \nto compel concessions that the regime would view as a blow to national \npride. In short, Iran might -- might -- be more willing to accept a face-\nsaving compromise than they were a year or two ago, but will need serious \ninducements to do so. \nWhat would that entail? Virtually all the proposals that have come from \noutside experts suggest that the P5+1 begin with modest confidence-\nbuilding measures, especially in the period before the election. A recent \nreport by the Arms Control Association enumerates several of them. \nWestern diplomats, for example, could take up Ali Akbar Salehi, Iran's \nforeign minister, on his proposal to limit the \"extent\" of enrichment -- i.e., \nwell below 20 percent -- in exchange for fuel rods for the research reaction \nand a recognition of Iran's \"right to enrich,\" a notional concept the United \nStates already supports under specified conditions. Or Iran could suspend \n20-percent enrichment in exchange for a suspension of new sanctions. But \nIran is unlikely to accept even such small steps unless it felt that additional \nmoves would win additional explicit concessions. \nBeyond that, the outlines of what in Middle East peacemaking is known as \n\"final status\" are clear enough: Iran agrees to verifiable inspections to \nensure that it does not enrich uranium beyond 3.5 percent and does not \npursue a nuclear weapons program, while the West accepts Iran's \"right to \nenrich\" and dismantles sanctions. Of course, the outlines of a Middle East \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027106 \npeace deal are clear enough, too. But in both cases, neither side trusts the \nother, and each demands that the other go first. Instead, nobody goes \nanywhere. \nU.S. officials have very good reason to be wary of Iran's bona fides. In \n2009, they reached a deal with Iranian negotiators to send the stockpile of \nhighly enriched uranium out of the country -- only to see the ayatollah \nrepudiate it. As Ray Takeyh, an Iran expert with the Council on Foreign \nRelations puts it, \"Khamenei has created a politics where it's hard for him \nto compromise.\" But so has the United States. Anyone who watched \nChuck Hagel's confirmation hearing knows that it is an article of faith in \nCongress -- and pretty much a bipartisan one -- that Iran is a faithless, \nillegitimate terrorist state that will be deterred from building a bomb only \nby the threat of massive attack. Had Hagel been foolish enough to suggest \nthat the United States offer to reduce sanctions in exchange for Iranian \nconcessions, the White House would have had to find a new candidate for \ndefense secretary. \nIt's the U.S. Congress that arguably holds the high cards, though the White \nHouse put them in its hands. The most potent sanctions are legislated, and \nhave been written in such a way that they will be very hard to unwind. \nObama can waive them for up to six months. But the ayatollah is not about \nto make irreversible decisions in exchange for six months of relief. \nThe White House is thus stuck between Tehran and Capitol Hill. And it \ncan't live long with the current stalemate. After all, Obama has said that \n\"containment\" is not an option. He is hoping that the combination of \neconomic pain and fear of military action will bring Tehran to its senses. If \nit doesn't, the president has said that he is prepared to use force. Perhaps \nhe feels that just as spurned engagement served as the predicate for tough \nsanctions, so would failed negotiations lay the predicate for a broadly \nsupported strike against Iran's nuclear facilities. Iran left us no choice, he \nmight say, as the bombers fly. \nThat would constitute a diplomatic triumph ... if a strike against Iran's \nnuclear facilities is a good idea. If in fact it's a dreadful prospect -- worse, \nperhaps, even than containment -- then it would constitute a failure that \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027107 \nwould obliterate the record of adroit diplomacy of the last four years. \nObama understands very well -- even if many members of Congress do \nnot -- that even our worst adversaries have interests of their own, that \nthose interests feel as legitimate to them as ours do to us, and that we at \nleast have a chance of settling disputes with them if we can find the place \nwhere our interests overlap. The time has come for him to apply that \nwisdom to Iran. \nJames Traub is a fellow of the Center on International Cooperation. \nArticle 3. \nThe National  \nAn uneasy courtship as Iran and Egypt test \nthe waters  \nAlan Philps \nFeb 8, 2013 -- There is a consensus among commentators that the visit of \nthe Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to Egypt - complete with \nred carpet and kiss on both cheeks from President Mohammed Morsi - \ndoes not amount to a breakthrough. The view of US think-tanks is that it \ndoes not amount to very much at all, and certainly not worth getting \nanxious about. Such a consensus is always dangerous, and it is worth \nlooking more closely at what it is based on. \nMr Ahmadinejad is the first Iranian leader to set foot in Cairo since the \ndeposed Shah of Iran was given refuge in Cairo, where he died and \nreceived a state funeral. The two countries have not had diplomatic \nrelations since 1979. \nThe Iranian president's visit has deep historical significance, even if he \ncame as a guest of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference summit. \nThe picture of the two presidents embracing says to the world: Egypt is \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027108 \nreleased from the US straitjacket and is free to resume its position as a \nregional power. \nThere are plenty of reasons, however, to dismiss the visit as just show. Mr \nAhmadinejad is a lame duck, banned by the constitution from running for \na third term in the June elections. As Iran moves into a period of war \neconomy under the pressure of sanctions designed to curb its nuclear \nprogramme, Mr Ahmadinejad is engaged in a furious struggle to ensure \nthat his rival, the parliamentary speaker, Ali Larijani, does not succeed \nhim. The corruption allegations levelled by Mr Ahmadinejad against the \nLarijani family are deeply damaging to the Iranian regime. \nMr Morsi, meanwhile, has little to show Egyptians that he has improved \ntheir lot. Cairo is the scene of near-constant street battles and the economy \nis tanking. Egypt's currency reserves have just sunk to $13.6 billion (Dh50 \nbillion), below the critical level needed to cover three months of imports. \nThe country is staring bankruptcy in the face, but cannot access \nemergency funds from the International Monetary Fund without \nimplementing unpopular reforms that would further raise social tensions. \nBoth leaders need to show that they have \"friends\" abroad. The reality is a \nlittle different. Egypt and Iran appear to be divided by the Syria conflict, \nwhich is symptomatic of the wider split between the Sunni Muslim \npowers, led by Saudi Arabia, and Iran's faltering \"axis of resistance\" that, \nwith Syria in play and Hamas having defected, now looks increasingly like \na Shia Muslim axis. \nIf we look more closely, then the story of Egypt resuming its role as a \nregional power looks premature. At this stage, Egypt is trying to find some \nspace to manoeuvre between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Given that Saudi \nArabia has the money that Egypt needs, and Washington has a lock on the \nactions of the IMF, that space is limited. \nBut what does Washington think? Not very much at the moment. With \nPresident Barack Obama's second term team still being assembled, it is not \nsurprising that there is something of a vacuum in Middle East policy. But \nthe issue is deeper than that. The Obama administration has declared it \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027109 \nwants to focus on the Asia-Pacific region and, surprisingly, it means what \nit says. \nOnly a year after troops withdrew from Iraq, that country is not talked \nabout in Washington, like an embarrassing relative. In North Africa, the \nUS military has taken a back seat while the work of toppling Colonel \nMuammar Qaddafi and driving back the jihadists in Mali has been left to \nFranco-British forces. Syrian policy is one of drift, where the \nadministration finds all options unpalatable. In Egypt, Washington has set \na red line for the Muslim Brotherhood leadership: it must adhere to the \npeace treaty with Israel. Everything else is negotiable. \nThis week the Pentagon revealed that it would no longer be stationing two \naircraft carriers in the Gulf region, as it has done for most of the past two \nyears, due to cuts in the defence budget, and the possibility of even more \nstringent ones if Congress fails to agree on raising the US debt ceiling. \nThe Iranian nuclear programme remains a priority in Washington, but the \ncarrier decision indicates a less warlike stance. One cannot say that US \npower is ebbing, but there is a clear lack of political will in Washington \nfor decisive action in the Middle East. For now, the logic is that regional \npowers will have to take more responsibility. Egypt, although impotent at \nthe moment, will have to find its role. The US needs to talk to Iran if there \nis ever going to be a compromise on its nuclear programme. Maybe Egypt \ncould help. \nBoth Egypt and Iran have denied a report that General Qassem Suleimani, \ncommander of the Quds force, a division of the Iranian Islamic \nRevolutionary Guard Corps, and the man responsible for Iran's military \noperations in Syria, visited Cairo in January. There was no reaction in \nWashington to this report. \nIf there is going to be a resolution of the Syrian crisis without a decade of \nLebanon-style war, then allies of the US will have to speak to someone of \nthe calibre of Gen Suleimani, a far more important figure than Mr \nAhmadinejad. Could this lead to a historic compromise between the \nMuslim Brotherhood and the ayatollahs to create a new Islamic front \nspreading revolution? \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027110 \nThat is out of the question. Egypt is too reliant on foreign finance, which \nIran cannot offer at the moment, for it to swing into Tehran's orbit. And \nthere is far too much domestic opposition. \nWhat is clear is that while the US is reluctant to take direct responsibility, \nother countries must find ways of resolving the regional contradictions \nthat have become unmanageable in the era of American tutelage. That will \nlead to some unlikely meetings taking place. The Morsi-Ahmadinejad \nembrace may not be a breakthrough, but it does show one thing: what was \nunthinkable a few years ago may one day be the norm. \nArticle 4. \nAl-Monitor \nllamas Weighs Options For Recognizing Israel \nAdnan Abu Amer \nFebruary 8 -- Recently, a lot has been said — and a lot of denials have \nbeen issued — about Hamas recognizing a two-state solution. It appears \nthat Hamas is still vacillating between explicitly and implicitly \nrecognizing Israel. Hamas realizes that recognizing Israel would open up \nthe world's doors to the movement. At the same time, Hamas knows that \nsuch a move would be seen as a betrayal by the movement's supporters, \nboth inside and outside Palestine. As Hamas well knows, its legitimacy \nderives from its vocal support for armed struggle within the complicated \nPalestinian reality. Hamas also knows that it will pay a heavy price if it is \nseen to be agreeing to international conditions. The cost will not only be \npolitical, but also ideological. Hamas has spent many years talking and \nwriting about its notion of the state, its identity, borders, concept, \nconstitution and the role of Islam within it. Generations of Hamas \nmembers were raised on those ideas. But those ideas have remained part \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027111 \nof the imagination and heritage, and of the nostalgic dream of restoring the \nIslamic caliphate. \nThe concept of the state \nToday's debate within Hamas over the concept of the state is more \nconcrete than theoretical. The political conditions in the Palestinian \nterritories do not allow for dreaming about unrealistic grand theories being \npromoted by some Islamist movements. Hamas is facing real-world \nproblems that require real-world solutions. The Palestinian state being \nenvisioned by Palestinian, Arab, and world politicians is based on the June \n1967 borders. But does that fit Hamas's political vision and intellectual \norientation? Generations of Islamists have been raised on the concept of \nthe \"Islamic state,\" which is synonymous with the Islamic caliphate. But \nHamas's situation is a little different. Israel's occupation of all Palestinian \nterritories is a political and concrete obstacle to the dream of an Islamic \nstate and it forces the consideration of more realistic options. So we have \nstarted hearing, from Hamas, statements about establishing a Palestinian \nstate on the June 1967 borders. There is no doubt that this development is \nan intellectual and political shift by Hamas. More than 20 years ago, \nHamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin proposed a long truce with Israel. \nBut today, such a proposal is more realistic and is attributed to Hamas's \ncurrent leader Khaled Meshaal. Hamas in 2013 is different than Hamas in \n1993. Hamas is now an influential player and its statements and stances \nare taken into account by regional and international decision-making \ncircles. \nRecognition and commitment \nThe shuttle diplomacy by Western officials between Gaza, where Hamas's \ndomestic leadership is located, and the Arab capitals of Doha, Cairo and \nAmman have only one objective: getting Hamas to agree to the conditions \nthat would allow it to be embraced by the international community. In \nother words, they want Hamas to agree to the two-state solution. And that, \nexplicitly or implicitly, essentially means that Hamas has recognized \nIsrael's right to exist! Those who have been following Hamas's course \nsince it was founded 25 years ago notice that every once in awhile there is \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027112 \ninternational pressure to make Hamas agree to those conditions. But \nHamas is afraid to fall into the same trap that others, like Fatah, have \nfallen into without getting anything in return except loss of popular \nsupport, as was demonstrated in the elections seven years ago. In light of \nthe demands that the movement should recognize the two-state solution \nand make political commitments, some influential circles within the \nHamas leadership think that the movement is being drawn into going \nbeyond its rational political discourse and how it deals with the reality on \nthe ground, and into recognizing Israel and exchanging messages with \nit. However, the siege has made the Palestinian territories miserable. So \ndecision-makers in Hamas are forced to issue hints and signals that do not \naffect the movement's general principles. Those signals, however, may be \nmisunderstood. And this is where the problem lies. No one thinks that \nHamas supporters will make a big deal of those signals, but any concrete \nsteps toward recognizing Israel will cost Hamas dearly, something which I \ndon't think Hamas wants during this dangerous phase. At the external \nlevel, Hamas's enemies and opponents may think that the siege has finally \npaid off, albeit a little late, and that Hamas's current declarations are \nsignals that, if the siege and the Palestinian suffering continue, the \nmovement may explicitly recognize Israel, which would open the \n\"appetite\" of Hamas' opponents for more breakthroughs in its ideology \nand principles. \nNot an existential conflict, but a border dispute. \nAlthough Hamas is aware of all that, it should be noted that in a few \nmonths it is facing elections during which the movement's signals that it \nmay accept a two-state solution will be used in a fierce anti-Hamas \ncampaign. Even though the movement has provided a different \nadministrative performance than before, the fundamental change in the \nmovement's political program may be a decisive factor for the Palestinian \nvoters. As Hamas is being smothered, with a few breaches here and there, \nthe demands that it should recognize Israel are ongoing and without letup. \nIn other words, Hamas must choose between recognizing Israel to stay in \npower, or losing what it has achieved democratically as punishment for \nhaving to refused to bow to the world's conditions. In reality, the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027113 \ninternational community has not significantly changed its relationship with \nthe Palestinians, including Hamas, over the past months and years. There \nhas only been some cosmetic and tactical changes. Washington, the \nEuropean Union and the UN have not only signaled to Hamas that it \nshould join the \"broken and paralyzed\" peace process, they have also \ninsisted that the Palestinians explicitly recognize Israel. But this time, \nthose powers are armed with an \"Islamic religious cloak,\" which would \nmake a recognition of Israel more meaningful, especially since Hamas \nconsiders its conflict with Israel to be an ideological \"existential conflict, \nnot a border dispute.\" That pressure is accompanied with a financial and \neconomic blockade, which is increasing the pressure on Hamas, especially \nsince those carrying out the blockade are blocking anything that would \nalleviate Palestinian suffering. It is clear that they want to punish the \nPalestinians for electing Hamas and warn them against reelecting them; \nthat is if the reconciliation succeeds and the elections happen on time. It \nshould be noted that certain Israeli and Western research institutions have \nestimated the timeframe that Hamas will need to explicitly recognize \nIsrael. They may accept from Hamas certain rhetorical signals for a while \nbefore the movement officially recognizes Israel. Since Hamas was \nfounded in late 1987, it has been conducting an ideological and political \ncampaign for its members and supporters against recognizing Israel. \nHamas' constitution says that Israel is a \"cancer that must be eradicated,\" \nand that \"its demise is a Quranic inevitability.\" Those and other slogans \nhave been a key component of Hamas's political discourse. It is therefore \nnot easy for Hamas to change overnight due to political realism and \nsuddenly tell its supporters: We shall recognize Israel, but it's under \nduress! \nAdnan Abu Amer is Dean of the Faculty of Arts, and a lecturer in the \nhistory of the Palestinian issue, national security, political science and \nIslamic civilization at Al Ummah University Open Education. \nArticle 6. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027114 \nNYT \nAn Assassination in Tunisia  \nEditorial \nFebruary 8, 2013 -- Tunisia is where the Arab Spring began just over two \nyears ago. Until now it has set an encouraging example of progress toward \ndemocracy and pluralism. Free elections brought to power a coalition \ngovernment pledged to pragmatic cooperation between a moderate-led \nIslamist party, Ennanda, and smaller, secular coalition partners. \nProgress has not always been smooth. But just as Tunisians inspired \npeople in neighboring countries like Egypt and Libya to rise up against \ntheir corrupt and repressive dictators, they also seemed, for many, to point \nthe way toward a democratic future accommodating both religious beliefs \nand the rights of the secular under the rule of law. \nThose hopes have been severely shaken by the murder on Wednesday of \nChokri Belaid. Mr. Belaid, a human- rights activist and one of Ennanda's \nmost outspoken critics, had publicly challenged the party's failure to \ninvestigate or prosecute violent acts of intimidation carried out by \nshadowy gangs of religious extremists. Mr. Belaid's killers have not yet \nbeen identified. But suspicion now falls on those same extremist groups, \nwhich had issued public threats against Mr. Belaid and other prominent \nsecular leaders — without any serious government response. \nThousands gathered for Mr. Belaid's funeral on Friday amid a nationwide \ngeneral strike called by his trade union supporters. Tensions are high. \nWhat is urgently needed is a credible, independent investigation of Mr. \nBelaid's murder, followed by prosecution of the killers. \nGiven Ennanda's record of selectively ignoring Islamist violence, that \ninvestigation cannot be left to its appointees alone. A preferable \nalternative would be to reconstitute the broad-based, multiparty \ncommissions that successfully oversaw Tunisia's free elections in October \n2011 and investigated the crimes of the fallen dictatorship. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027115 \nEnnanda, which captured 41 percent of the vote in the elections, promised \nto cooperate with secular parties and show respect for pluralism. Instead, it \nis sending muddled messages. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Hamadi \nJebali made a conciliatory gesture by proposing a temporary nonpolitical \ncabinet and new elections. Unfortunately, hard-line party members quickly \nrepudiated him. \nTunisia's revolution, which has overcome past crises, can overcome this \none if Ennanda and all other Tunisian parties recommit themselves to \nnonviolence, mutual tolerance and upholding the rule of law. \nArticle 7. \nThe Washington Post \nIraq's return to bloodshed \nKimberly Kagan and Frederick W. Kagan \nFebruary 8, 2013 -- Eighteen days of protests in Egypt in 2011 electrified \nthe world. But more than twice that many days of protest in Iraq have \ngone almost unnoticed in the United States. Iraqi army troops killed five  \nSunni protesters in Fallujah on Jan. 25, after a month of anti-government \nprotests in Anbar, Nineveh and Salahuddin provinces and elsewhere for \nwhich thousands turned out. Al-Qaeda in Iraq and Iranian-backed Shiite \nmilitias are re-mobilizing. Iraq teeters on the brink of renewed insurgency \nand, potentially, civil war. \nThis crisis matters for America. U.S. vital interests that have been \nundermined over the past year include preventing Iraq from becoming a \nhaven for al-Qaeda and destabilizing the region by becoming a security \nvacuum or a dictatorship that inflames sectarian civil war; containing \nIranian influence in the region; and ensuring the free flow of oil to the \nglobal market. \nWhile tensions have risen over the past two years, the triggers for recent \neruptions are clear. Prime Minister Noun al-Maliki, a Shiite, had the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027116 \nbodyguards of Finance Minister Rafie al-Issawi, who is Sunni, arrested for \nalleged terrorist activities on Dec. 20 — almost exactly one year after he \nordered the arrest of Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi's security \ndetail. Hashimi fled to Turkey and is unlikely to return soon to Iraq, where \nhe was sentenced to death after Maliki demanded his trial in absentia for \nmurder and financing terrorism. \nThe threat to Issawi, a moderate technocrat from Anbar, galvanized Iraqi \nSunnis, who rightly saw Maliki's move as sectarian and an assault on \ngovernment participation by Sunnis not under the prime minister's thumb. \nThree days after the arrests, demonstrations broke out in Ramadi, Fallujah \nand Samarra. Three days after that, a large protest closed the highway  \nfrom Baghdad to Syria and Jordan. The popular resistance spread to Mosul \non Dec. 27. \nThese protests erupted during a constitutional crisis and as an expanding \nArab-Kurd conflict has become increasingly militarized. Iraqi President \nJalal Talabani was incapacitated by a stroke on Dec. 17 and has been out \nof the countryfor treatment. Iraq's constitution specifies a line of \nsuccession — but with one vice president in exile and the other a Shiite \nand obvious Maliki proxy, Iraq has been, in effect, operating without a \npresident. Political processes that require presidential involvement have \nbeen paralyzed, including moving forward with long-standing efforts by \nSunnis and Kurds to hold a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in Maliki. \nTalabani had been the critical link holding Baghdad and Kurdistan \ntogether since tensions rose following a 10-day standoff between Iraqi \narmy units and Kurdish pesh merga troops in October, after Maliki sent \nthe army toward the disputed city of Kirkuk. That move followed a series \nof skirmishes and mobilizations along the \"Green Line\" separating \nKurdistan from Arab Iraq and a series of attacks in the area by al-Qaeda in \nIraq. \nThe recent protests underscore the collapse of the inclusive political \naccommodation reached in 2007, which had been reconfirmed by the \nformation of a grand Sunni-Shiite-Kurd coalition government after \nparliamentary elections in 2010. By November 2012, Maliki had evolved \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027117 \nto openly discussing his intention to form a \"majoritarian government\" \nthat would exclude the most important Sunni representatives. In mid-\nDecember he participated in creating a Shiite grand alliance as the \nlaunching pad for that government. The principal Sunni political leaders, \nincluding Issawi, parliamentary speaker Osama al-Nujaifiand Anbari tribal \nleader Ahmed abu Rishaannounced their intention to form their own \ncoalition. In short, Iraqi politics was re-fragmenting along sectarian and \nethnic lines even before the protests began. \nUnderstood in this context, the Iraqi army's killing of protesters in \nFallujah last month is a watershed event similar to the destruction of the \nAskariya shrine in Samarra in February 2006, though the crisis will not \nescalate as quickly. Sunni-Shiite tensions have hitherto played out in \npolitical forums. The key actors in today's crisis are not the Sunni political \nleaders but, rather, Anbari tribal leaders, including Ali Hatem Ali \nSuleiman, one of the most powerful leaders of Iraq's largest Sunni tribe. \nSuleiman and fellow leaders of the Dulaim tribe were essential to \nengineering the Anbar Awakening in 2007 and Sunni participation in the \ngovernment, for which they rejected al-Qaeda in Iraq and renounced \nviolence against the state. They responded to the killings of protesters last \nmonth by threatening open war against the state for the first time since \n2007. So far at least, they have restrained protesters and resisted violent \nconfrontation. \nFor his part, Maliki has sought to deescalate the conflict and to mollify \nprotesters. Tehran has also been working — to persuade Iraq's Sadrists, \nwhom Maliki has alienated in his consolidation of power, to abandon their \nsupport for their Sunni brethren. Their combined efforts appear to be \nworking: The Sadrist Bloc, which had refused Maliki's request for \nsuggestions to replace Issawi and other Sunni politicians, has put forth a \nsubstitute finance minister. \nThese efforts, ostensibly toward political resolution, actually increase the \nlikelihood of sectarian war by continuing the marginalization of Sunni \npolitical leaders without addressing Sunni tribes' core grievances — and \nby re-creating a Shiite front that had splintered. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027118 \nAl-Qaeda in Iraq has already taken advantage of this situation through its \nfront group, the Islamic State of Iraq, which deployed combat teams in \nFallujah last month that targeted Iraqi army positions and killed several \nsoldiers. The jihadists' black flags have appeared at Sunni protests and \nmemorial ceremonies for the fallen. The group is back in the havens it \nheld in 2006. If Maliki does not allow proper Sunni representation in \ngovernment, al-Qaeda will gain greater popular tolerance and foreign \nsupport. \nOver the past year, the situation in Iraq has become explosive while \nsectarian sentiment and armed violence in neighboring nations have \nescalated dramatically. Americans have become accustomed to watching \nIraq approach the precipice and draw back. But circumstances have \nchanged with the withdrawal of all U.S. forces and Maliki's year-long \nefforts to intimidate his opponents through political, judicial and military \nmaneuvers. If Maliki does not accept many of the protesters' reasonable \ndemands and allow meaningful Sunni participation in government, \nprospects for stopping Iraq's descent into sectarian conflict are grim. \nKimberly Kagan is president of the Institute for the Study of War. \nFrederick W.

He was \nborn in 1949 and grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His father, \nRichard Pipes, was a professor of Russian history, now emeritus, at \nHarvard. Daniel studied Arabic and Islamic history and lived in Cairo for \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027119 \nthree years. His PhD dissertation became his first book, Slave Soldiers \nand Islam (1981). Then his interest in purely academic subjects expanded \nto include modern Islam. He left the university because, as he told an \ninterviewer from Harvard Magazine, he has \"the simple politics of a truck \ndriver, not the complex ones of an academic.\" His story of being \nharassed through the legal system by a Muslim who later committed \nsuicide was recently told in The American Spectator (\"A Palestinian in \nTexas,\" TAS, November 2012). He has been personally threatened but \nprefers not to talk about specifics except to note that law enforcement has \nbeen involved. I interviewed Pipes shortly before Christmas, when the \nEgyptians were voting on their new constitution. I started out by saying \nthat the number of Muslims in the U.S. has doubled since the 9/11 attacks. \nDP: My career divides in two: before and after 9/11. In the first part I was \ntrying to show that Islam is relevant to political concerns. If you want to \nunderstand Muslims, I argued, you need to understand the role of Islam in \ntheir lives. Now that seems obvious. If anything, there's a tendency to \nover-emphasize Islam; to assume that Muslims are dominated by the \nKoran and are its automatons—which goes too far. You can't just read the \nKoran to understand Muslim life. You have to look at history, at \npersonalities, at economics, and so on. \nTB: Do you see the revival of Islam as a reality? \nDP: Yes. Half a century ago Islam was waning, the application of its laws \nbecame ever more remote, and the sense existed that Islam, like other \nreligions, was in decline. Since then there has been a sharp and I think \nindisputable reversal. We're all talking about Islam and its laws now. \nTB: At the same time you have raised an odd question: \"Can Islam \nsurvive Islamism?\" Can you explain that? \nDP: I draw a distinction between traditional Islam and Islamism. Islamism \nemerged in its modern form in the 1920s and is driven by a belief that \nMuslims can be strong and rich again if they follow the Islamic law \nseverely and in its entirety. This is a response to the trauma of modern \nIslam. And yet this form of Islam is doing deep damage to faith, to the \npoint that I wonder if Islam will ever recover. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027120 \nTB: Give us the historical context. \nDP: The modern era for Muslims began with Napoleon's invasion of \nEgypt in 1798. Muslims experienced a great shock at seeing how \nadvanced the blue-eyed peoples from the north had become. It would be \nroughly analogous to the Eskimos coming down south and decimating \nWesterners, who would uncomprehendingly ask in response, \"Who are \nthese people and how are they defeating us?\" \nTB: So how did they respond? \nDP: Muslims over the past 200 years have made many efforts to figure out \nwhat went wrong. They have experimented with several answers. One was \nto emulate liberal Europe—Britain and France—until about 1920. Another \nwas to emulate illiberal Europe—Germany and Russia—until about 1970. \nThe third was to go back to what are imagined to be the sources of Islamic \nstrength a millennium ago, namely the application of Islamic law. That's \nIslamism. It's a modern phenomenon, and it's making Muslims the center \nof world unrest. \nTB: But it is also creating discomfort? \nDP: It has terribly deleterious effects on Muslims. Many of them are put \noff by Islam. In Iran, for example, one finds a lot of alienation from Islam \nas a result of the Islamist rule of the last 30-odd years. \nTB: Has it happened anywhere else? \nDP: One hears reports, especially from Algeria and Iraq, of Muslims \nconverting to Christianity. And in an unprecedented move, ex-Muslims \nliving in the West have organized with the goal of becoming a political \nforce. I believe the first such effort was the Centraal Comite voor Ex-\nmoslims in the Netherlands, but now it's all over the place. \nTB: Nonetheless, Islam has lasted for 1,500 years. \nDP: Yes, but modern Islamism has been around only since the 1920s, and \nI predict it will not last as a world-threatening force for more than a few \ndecades. Will Muslims leave the faith or simply stop practicing it? These \nare the sort of questions I expect to be current before long. \nTB: What about Islam in the United States? \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027121 \nDP: In the long term, the United States could greatly benefit Islam by \nuniquely freeing the religion from government constraints and permitting \nit to evolve in a positive, modern direction. But that's the long term. Right \nnow, American Muslims labor under Saudi and other influences, their \ninstitutions are extreme, and things are heading in a destructive direction. \nIt's also distressing to see how non-Muslim individuals and institutions, \nparticularly those on the left, indulge Islamist misbehavior. \nTB: How do they do that? \nDP: Well, turn on the television, go to a class, follow the work of the \nACLU or the Southern Poverty Law Center, and you will see corporations, \nnonprofits, and government institutions working with the Islamists, \nhelping promote the Islamist agenda. The American left and the Islamists \nagree on what they dislike—conservatives—and, despite their profound \ndifferences, they cooperate. \nTB: Presumably some Muslims here deconvert, right? \nDP: There are some conversions out of Islam, yes. And the Muslim \nestablishment in this country is quite concerned about that. But \nnumerically it is not a significant number. \nTB: The ones who convert don't talk about it very much? \nDP: In some cases they do; they take advantage of Western freedoms to \nspeak their minds. They are the exceptions, though. \nTB: I suspect that the decline of Christianity has encouraged Islam. \nDP: Very much so, as the contrast between Europe and the United States \nreveals. The hard kernel of American Christian faith, not present in \nEurope, means that Islamists are far better behaved in the United States. \nThey see the importance of a Christian counterforce. \nTB: Earlier, you mentioned Algeria. It is a big Muslim state that we \ndon't hear about today. \nDP: Twenty years ago Algeria was a major focus of attention. That long \nago ended, although in France coverage is still significant. Algeria is ripe \nfor the same kind of upheaval that we have seen in other North African \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027122 \nstates, such as Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt. I think it is likely to happen \nbefore too long. \nTB: What about Syria? \nDP: Assad's power is steadily diminishing and I cannot see how his \nregime will remain long in power. \nTB: Should the United States get involved there? \nDP: No, Americans have no dog in this fight and nothing in the U.S. \nConstitution requires us to get involved in every foreign conflict. Two \nwretched forces are killing each other; just look at the ghastly videos of \nthe two sides torturing and executing the other. Listen also to what they \nare saying. It's a civil war involving the bad and the worse. I don't want \nthe U.S. government involved. That would mean bearing some moral \nresponsibility for what emerges, which I expect to be very unsavory. \nTB: So you are supporting the Obama position? \nDP: Yes, though he reaches it with far more angst. Also, there appears to \nbe some serious, clandestine U.S. support for the rebel forces. The \nSeptember 11 meeting in Benghazi between the Turkish and the American \nambassadors was very curious. They are both based in Tripoli, hundreds \nof miles away. What were they doing in Benghazi? Arranging for \nAmerican arms going via Turkey to Syria, it appears. \nTB: How important has Israel been to the revival of Islam? \nDP: It is a major factor in the neighboring states. But elsewhere, in \nMorocco, Iran, Malaysia, it has minor importance. \nTB: Since the \"Arab Spring,\" Israel seems increasingly beleaguered. \nDP: Not really, not yet, though I agree that it will be more beleaguered \nwith time. Its neighbors are so consumed with their own affairs that they \nhardly pay Israel attention. But once the neighbors get their houses in \norder, Israel will most likely face new difficulties. \nTB: You have questioned U.S. support for Islamic democracy, which \ndoes seem naive. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027123 \nDP: The U.S. has been the patron for democracy for a century, since \nWilson's 14 Points, and a wonderful heritage it has been. When an \nAmerican travels the world, he finds himself in country after country \nwhere his country played a monumentally positive role, especially in \ndemocratizing the system. We naturally want to extend this to Muslim-\nmajority countries. Sadly, these for some time have offered an unpleasant \nchoice between brutal and greedy dictators or ideological, extreme, and \nantagonistic elected Islamists. It's not a choice we should accept. \nTB: So what should we do? \nDP: I offer three simple guidelines. One, always oppose the Islamists. Like \nfascists and Communists, they are the totalitarian enemy, whether they \nwear long beards in Pakistan or suits in Washington. \nTwo, always support the liberal, modern, secular people who share our \nworldview. They look to us for moral and other sustenance; we should be \ntrue to them. They are not that strong, and cannot take power soon \nanywhere, but they represent hope, offering the Muslim world's only \nprospect of escape from the dreary dichotomy of dictatorship or \nextremism. \nThree, and more difficult, cooperate with dictators but condition it on \npushing them toward reform and opening up. We need the Mubaraks of \nthe world and they need us. Fine, but relentlessly keep the pressure on \nthem to improve their rule. Had we begun this process with Abdullah \nSaleh of Yemen in 1978 or with Mubarak in 1981, things could have been \nvery different by 2011. But we didn't. \nTB: Egypt might be the test case. \nDP: Well, it's a bit late. Mohammed Morsi is not a greedy dictator but he \nemerged from the Muslim Brotherhood, and his efforts since reaching \npower have been purely Islamist. \nTB: What about the recent elections? \nDP: I do not believe that a single one of the elections and referenda in \nEgypt was fairly conducted. It surprises me that Western governments and \nmedia are so gullible on this score. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027124 \nTB: You could say we were supporting the democracy element in Cairo's \nTahrir Square. Were we not? \nDP: Yes and rightly so. The initial demonstrations of early 2011 were \nspearheaded by the liberals and seculars who deserve U.S. support. But \nthey got quickly pushed aside and Washington barely paid them further \nattention. \nTB: We gave foreign aid to Mubarak. Was that a bad idea? \nDP: That aid dates back to the utterly different circumstances of the \nEgypt-Israel peace treaty of 1979 and became progressively more wrong-\nheaded. It should long ago have been discontinued. More broadly, I \nbelieve in aid for emergencies (soup and blankets) and as a bribe, but not \nfor economic development. That the Obama administration is \ncontemplating aid, including military hardware, to the Morsi government \noutrages me. \nClick here to Reply or Forward \n22.2 GB (10%) of 210.1 GBManage \n©2013 Google - Terms & Privacy \nLast account activity: 0 minutes ago \nDetails \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

I’ve just been.\nYou will never think the same way about anything again.”\n\nSo spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up\neverywhere at the moment as the alleged “procurer” of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEpstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of\nanother investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with\nallegations that he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British\nnewspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein’s friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to\npublicly disassociate himself from his old pal.\n\nI wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called “The Talented Mr. Epstein.” It was largely a business piece that\nfocused on his mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les\nWexner, the chairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude\nHoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of\n$450 million.\n\nThe piece alluded to Epstein’s great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women\nwith whom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn’t really go there, focusing instead on the\nissue that remains a mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers.\n\nThis is not to say I didn’t hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I\nconcentrated on the intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same\nones, different ones. And their stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one\ncase, flown—to ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? And the British, especially, want to know:\nWho is she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, my 2003 Vanity\nFairstory that really brought him into the limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030414\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

A subself is a partially\nautonomous self-network focused on particular tasks, environments or interactions. It contains\na unique model of the whole organism, and generally has its own set of episodic memories,\nconsisting of memories of those intervals during which it was the primary dynamic mode con-\ntrolling the organism. One common example is the creative subself — the subpersonality that\ntakes over when a creative person launches into the process of creating something. In these\ntimes, a whole different personality sometimes emerges, with a different sort of relationship\nto the world. Among other factors, creativity requires a certain open-ness that is not always\nproductive in an everyday life context, so it’s natural for the selfsystem of a highly creative\nperson to bifurcate into one self-system for everyday life, and another for the protected context\nof creative activity. This sort of phenomenon might emerge naturally in CogPrime systems as\nwell if they were exposed to appropriate environments and social situations.\n\nFinally, it is interesting to speculate regarding how self may differ in future AI systems as\nopposed to in humans. The relative stability we see in human selves may not exist in AI systems\nthat can self#improve and change more fundamentally and rapidly than humans can. There may\nbe a situation in which, as soon as a system has understood itself decently, it radically modifies\nitself and hence violates its existing self-model. Thus: intelligence without a long-term stable self.\nIn this case the “attractor-ish” nature of the self holds only over much shorter time scales than\nfor human minds or human-like minds. But the alternating process of synthesis and analysis\nfor self-construction is still critical, even though no reasonably stable self-constituting attractor\never emerges. The psychology of such intelligent systems will almost surely be beyond human\nbeings’ capacity for comprehension and empathy.\n\n3.4.4.2 Attentional Focus\n\nFinally, we turn to the notion of an “attentional focus” similar to Baars’ [Baa97] notion of a\nGlobal Workspace, which will be reviewed in more detail in Chapter 4: a collection of mental\nentities that are, at a given moment, receiving far more than the usual share of an intelligent\nsystem’s computational resources. Due to the amount of attention paid to items in the atten-\ntional focus, at any given moment these items are in large part driving the cognitive processes\ngoing on elsewhere in the mind as well - because the cognitive processes acting on the items in\nthe attentional focus are often involved in other mental items, not in attentional focus, as well\n(and sometimes this results in pulling these other items into attentional focus). An intelligent\nsystem must constantly shift its attentional focus from one set of entities to another based on\nchanges in its environment and based on its own shifting discoveries.\n\nIn the human mind, there is a self-reinforcing dynamic pertaining to the collection of entities\nin the attentional focus at any given point in time, resulting from the observation that: If A\nis in the attentional focus, and A and B have often been associated in the past, then odds\nare increased that B will soon be in the attentional focus. This basic observation has been\nrefined tremendously via a large body of cognitive psychology work; and neurologically it follows\nnot only from Hebb’s [Heb49] classic work on neural reinforcement learning, but also from\nnumerous more modern refinements [SB98]. But it implies that two items A and B, if both in\nthe attentional focus, can reinforce each others’ presence in the attentional focus, hence forming\na kind of conspiracy to keep each other in the limelight. But of course, this kind of dynamic\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012965\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Second, he\nslammed State Attorney Bar-\nryKrischer in blunt language\nseldom used by one law-\nerfforcement official con-\ncerning another because of\nwhat he perceived as that of\nfice’s mishandling of the\ncase.\n\n‘vIn a letter to Krischer\n\nwritten May 1, Reiter called’\n\nhis actions in the Epstein\ncase “highly unusual.” He\nadded, “Imusturge youto...\nconsider if good and suffi-\ncient reason exists to require\nyour disqualification from the\nprosecution of these cases.’\nIn short, Reiter told the\ncounty’s top prosecutor for\nthe past 13 years that he\nought to get off the case. “It\n\n‘looks like a departure from\n\nprofessionalism,” Miami-\nDade State Attorney\nKatherine Fernandez Rundle\nsaid of Reiter’s letter.\nFollowing Epstein’s in-\ndictment, Reiter referred the\ncase to the FBI to determine\nwhether the _ super-rich,\nsuper-connected defendant\nhad violated any federal laws.\n\nReiter won’t discuss the\ncase or the broadsides aimed\nat him. But others almost\nuniformly use one word to\ndescribe the chief: profes-\nsional.\n\n“I have always been im-\npressed by Mike’s profes-\nsionalism and his leader-\nship,” said Rick Lincoln, chief\nof the Lantana Police Depart-\nment and a Palm Beach\nCounty cop for 32 years.\n\n“The town of Palm Beach\nhas a very professional police\ndepartment. We all consider\n\nMike to be our peer and a-\n\nman of integrity.”\n\nReiter: Town\nManager Peter\nElwell says the\nPalm Beach\npolice chief's\nwell worth his\n$144,000 sal-\nary.\n\nJuno Beach Police Chief\nH.C. Clark II agreed. Al-\nthough he doesn’t know Re-\niter well, he has met with him\non countywide law enforce-\nment issues. “T’ve never seen\nhim lose his cool. I’ve never\nseen anything but a profes-\nsional demeanor from him.”\n\nReiter joined the Palm\nBeach Police Department in\n1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year\npatrol job at the University of\nPittsburgh. His personnel\njacket shows consistently ex-\ncellent job evaluations.\n\nPosh Palm Beach is no\nhotbed of crime, and in his\nfirst year on the job, a resi-\n\ndent confined to his home\nwith a sick child thanked Re-\niter for delivering afew Cokes\n\nto the house. Reiter refused -\n\npayment for the beverages.\nAnother resident thanked\nReiter for shutting off his\ncar’s headlights in his drive-\nway, saying a valet must have\nbeen at fault.\n\nReiter worked everything\nfrom road patrol to organized\ncrime, vice and narcotics.\nAnd he’s no novice at investi-\ngations involving the island’s\n\nrich and famous. He was the ©\n\nlead detective probing the\ndrug overdose death of David\nKennedy in 1984. He also was\none of the officers who\nworked the investigation of\nWilliam Kennedy Smith, who\nwas charged in 1991 — and\nlater acquitted — with raping\na woman at the Kennedy\nfamily compound in Palm\nBeach.\n\nReiter, who has amaster’s\ndegree in human resource\n\n, Integrity\n\ndevelopment from Palm\n\nBeach Atlantic University, al- .\n\nso has attended the FBI Na-\ntional Academy in Quantico,\n\nVa., and management cours\n\nes at Harvard. He’s been ac‘\ntive in countywide interagen-\ncy law enforcement\norganizations and has a “top\nsecret” national security\nclearance.\n\n“He has a_ perspective\nthat’s broader than just ad-\ndressing the needs of the\ntown,” said Town Manager\nPeter Elwell, who promoted\nReiter from assistant chief to\nchief in March 2001. Reiter\nmakes more than $144,000 as\nthe town’s top cop. Elwell\nthinks he’s worth it.\n\n“He’s very businesslike,\nvery straightforward. He's\nnot easily agitated or flam-\nboyant. He’s about the work,\nElwell said. “I think that his\nservice as chief has been\noutstanding in five-plus\nyears,’\n\n@ larry_keller@pbpost.com\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018928\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He may or may not become the Republican nominee for \npresident. He may or may not win the presidency even if he becomes the nominee. Yet it is clear that he is \na phenomenon and that any history of the 2016 presidential race will have to spend a good bit of time \nanalyzing Trump and his impact. \n» \n>> From the time he announced on June 16, Trump has dominated social and mainstream media. He \ndominates the conversation despite the lack of paid advertising. Trump says outrageous things and his \nsupporters shrug it off. At every turn, his poll numbers continue to rise. \n» \n>> As a step toward understanding this amazing performance, I spent part of the Christmas break reading \nhis first bestseller, 'The Art of the Deal'. Written in 1987, this book is a classic among American business \nbooks and has influenced a generation of entrepreneurs. Trump wrote 'The Art of the Deal' when he was \n41 years old and having a successful run. The book's popularity contributed to Time Magazine's decision \nto feature Donald Trump on its cover in January 1989. \n» \n>> The portrait that emerges from this easy-to-read and remarkably interesting book is of an aggressive, \nambitious person who is constantly pushing, constantly learning, and always seeking the next \nchallenge. Reporters and analysts who are trying to understand Trump would be well served by slowing \ndown and reading this nearly three-decade-old bestseller. \n» \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025929 \n>> They would discover that Donald Trump has developed a remarkable set of rules and principles that \nallow him to make decisions with incredible speed. Trump knows a lot, but what is amazing is how rapidly \nhe figures out what he doesn't know. \n» \n>> My favorite story is of the Wollman Skating Rink in New York's Central Park. \n>> The Wollman Rink was a heavily used public skating rink which had fallen into disrepair in 1980. New \nYork City tried for six years to fix it, spent $13 million, and the rink still was not ready to open. In June of \n1986 Trump, who could see the rink from his apartment, finally got tired of the embarrassment and offered \nto fix the rink at his own expense. At first the city turned him down because its bureaucracy did not want to \nbe embarrassed by someone fixing something they couldn't fix. Trump kept pushing and finally out of \nembarrassment the city gave in. \n» \n>> The key part of the story is Trump's reaction to being put in charge. He promptly recognized that he \ndidn't know anything about fixing a skating rink. He asked himself who built a lot of skating rinks. \n\"Canadians!\" he concluded. He found the best Canadian ice skating rink construction company. When the \nCanadians flew in to assess the situation, they were amazed at how bad the city had been at solving the \nproblem. They assured Trump that this was an easy job. Trump fixed the six year embarrassment two \nmonths ahead of schedule and nearly $800,000 under-budget. (The city did end up paying for the work, and \nTrump donated the profits to charity.) \n» \n>> After reading this chapter you begin to think that maybe Donald Trump really could build a wall along \nour southern border for a lot less than our current government estimates. \n» \n>> 'The Art of the Deal' is filled with stories like this — stories of common sense stories of calculated risk \ntaking, and stories of innovation and marketing. \n>> Anyone who would like to better understand Donald Trump would be helped by reading this remarkable \nbook. \n» \n>> Another is his pledges and I have no way of knowing if he will make good on all of them but I do agree \nwith all of them. Trump is the only candidate that is serious about building The Wall\" ! Two other \nimportant pledges Trump has made that no other candidate of either party has matched! First deportation of \nmillions of illegals that are demanding and costing American taxpayers billions of dollars and \nsecond Closing 34 Muslim traing Camps throughout our country! I WOULD LIKE TRUMP OR ANY \nOTHER CANDIDATES PLEDGE TO REINSTATE ANY AND ALL MILITARY OFFICERS \nDISCHARGED BECAUSE THEY DISAGREED WITH OBAMA OR HIS POLICIES!! \n» \n>> Here is another that kind of wraps up my feelings about Trump \n>> Raccoon's in your basement! An interesting analogy \n>> You've been on vacation for two weeks, you come home, and your basement is infested with \nraccoon's. Hundreds of rabid, messy, mean raccoon's have overtaken your basement. You want them gone \nimmediately so you hire a guy. A pro.

He's the guy. He's the best. Period. That's why Trump.

You just \nwant this thing fixed. Trump may not be a saint, but doesn't have any lobbyist money influencing him, he \ndoesn't have political correctness restraining him, all you know is that he has been very successful, a good \nnegotiator, he has built a lot of things, and he's also not a politician, so he's not a cowardly politician. And \nhe says he'll fix it. You don't care if the guy has bad hair. You just want those raccoon's gone.

It was as if we’d never been there at all.\n\nYet there were the errors, setbacks and frustrations as well. Many months\ninto our planning, we conducted a series of run-throughs in which we simulated\nattaching the intercept to Israel’s telephone network in the south, not far from\nthe camp where I’d done my fironut. Though it all seemed to go as planned, the\nnext morning in rained heavily. Within hours, the phone company was getting\nreports from all around southern Israel of phones malfunctioning. Even\nallowing for the fact it rained less in the Sinai, we had to address the risk. I went\nto see the people in Meir Amit’s technology unit, and they began developing a\nwaterproofing system for the equipment.\n\nThe main problem with the equipment, however, was its sheer weight. The\nhelicopter could get us, and it, into Egypt. But we couldn’t fly directly to the\ncable site in the Sinai. We might just as well tell the Egyptians we were on our\nway. At around 1,100 pounds, it was much too heavy for us to carry. And if we\nwere going to go ahead with the mission, time was running short. A date for the\noperation had been set by the kirya: February 1964. I was not alone in believing\nthat, unless we cracked the problem of getting the equipment to the cable site,\nthe operation was impossible.\n\nThe solution came from a staff officer in military intelligence. Meir Amit\nvisited our base once a month to hear how the preparations were going. With the\ndate getting closer, he brought along his entire staff. When I raised my concern\nabout the weight problem, a colonel from his personnel section said: “Why not\nbuild a lightweight rickshaw, small enough to get in the door of the helicopter,\nbut which can carry all or most of the equipment once you’re on the ground?”\nWithin days, they had a prototype, made of airline-standard tubing and designed\nto be pulled by two men. We held an exercise in the Negev. But it was almost\nimpossible for two men to pull through the sand. It also left deep zig-zag\nimprints in the sand, which would surely raise the suspicions of the Egyptians.\n\nBut prototype number-two was a four-wheel, chrome alloy cart. The\ntechnology experts had made the axles telescopic, so the vehicle would get\nthrough the door of the chopper but could be expanded to the width of an\nEgyptian army Jeep.

So they cram\nmath down their own throats, knowing that it is a ticket to America.\nVery few of these applicants come from Germany, Sweden, France, or\nItaly. Is this because they teach math badly there or is it because those\npeople aren’t desperate to move to the United States?\n\nU.S. students are not desperate to move to the United States, so\nwhen you suggest to them that they numb themselves with formulas\nand equations, they refuse to do so. The right answer would be to\nmake math and science actually interesting, but with those awful tests\nas the ultimate arbiter of success, this is very difficult to do. Math and\nscience are not important subjects. There, I said it. Start the lynching.\nOne can live a happy life without ever having taken a physics course\nor knowing what a logarithm is.\n\nBut being able to reason on the basis of evidence actually is im-\nportant. You cannot live well without this skill (or any of the other\ncognitive processes I have been writing about). Diagnosis is science\nas it actually is practiced by scientists. Science is not a bunch of\nstuff to be memorized. It is the fact-based tests that cause this prob-\nlem. We don’t need more math and science. We need more people\nwho can think.\n\nTESTING FOCUSES TEACHERS ON WINNING NOT TEACHING\n\nMany teachers are extremely frustrated by the system they have found\nthemselves a part of. They cannot afford to spend time teaching a\nstudent or getting a concept across if the issues being taught are not\non the tests. They are judged on the basis of test scores. So any ratio-\nnal teacher gives up teaching and becomes a kind of test preparation\ncoach. Testing has become a kind of contest between schools, much\nlike football. I like football. But the football mentality that envelops\nour concept of schooling is a disaster.\n\nTake a look at this excerpt of an article taken from my local\npaper. What our educators are worrying about is winning the game.\nUnfortunately, the game has nothing to do with educating students\nand everything to do with test scores, which are probably less valuable\nthan football scores in predicting anything about the future of\nchildren’s lives.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023829\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The man who many\nsee as oe for the democratisation of computing and who is the biggest activist philanthropist across the globe is\n\nIn his home, America, he ranks only 5th, behind Pope Francis, President Obama, Billy Graham, and George W. Bush. Mr\nObama and the Pope have a strong lead in Western nations but Mr Gates is highly regarded in every country polled, from\nBrazil to Egypt, Nigeria to Indonesia, Britain to Russia to Australia. ee as respondents there said: “He\ngot into a good university, but gave up studying to start his business. He has become a rich man despite dropping out of school\n... He has a successful career and a caring heart — he is ordinary, but great.”\n\nThe Queen came highest in Britain and second in Australia, but didn’t make the Indian top ten. Nevertheless she is the most\nadmired woman in the world, in 17th place, closely followed by Angelina Jolie and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nHalf of the top ten admired in Russia are women, including the pop singer Alla Pugacheva and the Queen. That is the highest\nfigure in all countries surveyed — women are strikingly under-represented.\n\nSome light is shed on this by comparing our results with a recent Gallup poll in America, which asked for most admired man\nand woman in separate questions. In that poll, Bill Clinton scored 2 per cent and Hillary Clinton 15. YouGov asked a single\nquestion, not differentiating men and women, and the two Clintons rated about the same. The two polls also show the power of\nthe media to direct public attention: Gallup polled early in December, and Pope Francis was “most admired” by only 4 per cent.\nBy the time of the YouGov survey, Time magazine had made him its Person of the Year, and he shot up to 21 per cent.\n\nBusiness leaders did well in general. YouGov puts Sir Richard Branson 4th in Britain, the Hong Kong billionaire Sir Li Kashing\nwas sixth in China; the Nigerian industrialist Aliko Dangote was third in his home country; Silvio Santos, a media billionaire,\nwas 4th in Brazil; Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the tycoon recently freed by Vladimir Putin, was 8th in Russia; while Warren Buffett,\nwho is admired in India, Pakistan and China, was 8th in the world.\n\nActors and musicians do less well. With the exception of the Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan, Ms Jolie and Stephen\nFry, who confirms his enormous Twitter following by making 7th in Britain, just below Desmond Tutu. Johnny Depp and Brad\nPitt get close to the top in a couple of countries and Justin Bieber did well in Indonesia, but the rock star and anti-poverty\ncampaigner Bono is notable by his absence.\n\nSportsmen were more highly regarded, with the Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar 5th in the world — but only because he is so\nadored in the world’s second-most populous country. The footballer Lionel Messi had broader support, reaching 15th in the\nworld. In Britain, David Beckham squeaked into 10th place.\n\nIn only two countries of the 13 surveyed did no local politician make it into the top ten — Australia and the UK. The omission\nwas most striking in Britain where Nigel Farage, the top politician, was in 16th place. David Cameron received the “most\nadmired” accolade from only two people in a thousand. In Germany, Angela Merkel scored 65 times higher at 13 per cent,\nsecond only to the Pope. Vladimir Putin topped the Russian poll with a whopping 24 per cent, Nicolas Sarkozy was third in\nFrance and Goodluck Jonathan 8th in Nigeria. Edward Snowden, responsible for leaking classified documents that revealed\nthe extent of surveillance by America’s National Security Agency, was 10th most admired in the country that granted him\nasylum, Russia. He also showed strongly in Germany. We also asked who was the most famous person in the world.

A\nthunderbolt. That was how it felt when I’d set eyes on nineteen-year-old Nili\nSonkin in mid-February 1963.\n\nIt was my first visit to the kirya in Tel Aviv. I'd been told to report to the\nadministrative section, to register my formal change of status from a mere\ndraftee to a staff officer, something I’d managed to overlook amid the demands\nof our first sayeret operations on the Golan. Since I didn’t know which office to\ngo to, I asked a girl sitting at a desk near the entrance. She looked up with a\nwide smile. When she directed me to the second floor, it wasn’t just her voice\nthat struck me: multi-timbered, almost like a musical composition. It was her\neyes. Bright, radiant, green. Full of playful, unapologetic self-confidence.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, I invented a series of excuses to return to the\nkirya. I introduced myself to her, with as much composure as I could muster,\nand on each further visit chatted to her a bit more. I told her about growing up in\nMishmar Hasharon, about math and music, about Israel, and how, as a soldier in\nthe past few years, I’d walked almost every inch of the land — in short, about\neverything except our still-secret sayeret and our nighttime forays across the\nborder. She, too, opened up about her home and her family and her friends.\nThough there was another girl I’d been going out with — the younger sister of\nmy old kibbutz co-conspirator, Moshe — she was more a friend than a girlfriend.\nI’d never before felt anything like the connection I sensed with Nili, nor\nanything like the race in my heartbeat as I set out to see her.\n\nI also found myself gripped by an unexpected, and unfamiliar, lack of self-\nassurance. I was now 22, three years older than Nili. I had the inbred confidence\nof a kibbutznik, the quiet sense of specialness which, at least for another decade\nor so, would give the children of the kibbutzim a disproportionate place in\nIsrael’s government and army, media and the arts. The same confidence which\nhad convinced me as a raw recruit back in boot camp that I could lead a supply\nconvoy to the edge of the Sinai. Since then, I’d begun to make a mark in Sayeret\nMatkal as well, leading its first clandestine operation and receiving a citation\nfrom the chief-of-staff. Yet with Nili, I couldn’t help feeling unmoored, totally\nout of my depth. She was part of a different Israel. She was a Tel Avivit, born\nand raised in the largest and brashest city in our young state, a place which was\neverything the kibbutz was not. She had graduated from Alliance, a high school\n\n83\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027931\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Prince Naif’s official responsibilities imcluded\nmanaging Saudi relations with Osama bin Laden, see\nPrince Naif Mem. in Supp. Mot. to Dismiss at 2 (stating\nPrince Naif urged the Kingdom to strip bin Laden of his\nSaudi citizenship in 1994), and thus became a target of al\nQaeda himself (see, e.g., Bierstein Aff. in Opp’n to Prince\nSultan’s Mot. to Dismiss (fatwa issued by Osama bin\nLaden expressing extreme bitterness toward Saudi Royal\nfamily).) Therefore, Prince Naif’s administration of his\nresponsibilities was “clearly .... grounded in social,\neconomic, and political policy.” Burnett IT, 292 F.Supp.2d\nat 21 (citing Varig Airlines, 467 U.S. at 814, 104 S.Ct.\n2755)).\n\nThis Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Prince\nSalman and Prince Naif for their official acts. The FSIA\ndoes not immunize an official for his private tortious acts,\nhowever. See 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(5) (explaining torts\nexception is relevant to official’s official acts); Leutwyler,\n184 F.Supp.2d at 286-87 (explaming officials are\n“deemed foreign states when they are sued for actions\nundertaken within the scope of their official capacities’).\nAccordingly, the Court will consider the appropriateness\nof exercising personal jurisdiction over Prince Salman\nand Prince Naif for their alleged personal acts below.\n\nII. Personal Jurisdiction\n1121 To survive the motions to dismiss under Federal Rule\n\nWESTLAW\n\nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), Plaintiffs must make a prima\nfacie showing that personal jurisdiction exists over each\nmoving Defendant. PDK Labs, Inc. v. Friedlander, 103\nF.3d 1105, 1108 (Qd Cir.1997). The Court reviews the\ncomplaints and affidavits in a light most favorable to\nPlaintiffs, id., but it does not accept conclusory\nallegations or draw “argumentative inferences.” Mende v.\nMilestone Tech., Inc., 269 F.Supp.2d 246, 251\n(S.D.N.Y.2003) (citing Robinson v. Overseas Military\nSales Corp., 21 F.3d 502, 507 (2d Cir.1994)).\n\n131 Plaintiffs offer two bases for personal jurisdiction.\nFirst, New York’s long-arm statute, which the Court looks\nto in federal question cases in which no federal statute\nprovides for national service of process or when the Court\nis sitting in diversity. PDK Labs, 103 F.3d at 1108; Bank\nBrussels Lambert v. Fiddler Gonzalez & Rodriguez, 305\nF.3d 120, 124 (2d Cir.2002). *557 New York’s long-arm\nstatute, C.P.L.R. 302(a)(2), provides for personal\njurisdiction over a person who, personally or through an\nagent, “commits a tortious act within the state.” Because a\nco-conspirator can be considered an agent, see Chrysler\nCapital Corp. v. Century Power Corp., 778 F.Supp. 1260,\n1266 (S.D.N.Y.1991), Plaintiffs argue that Defendants are\nsubject to personal jurisdiction here based on the acts of\ntheir co-conspirators, the al Qaeda terrorists.\n\n4] 5] 16] As this Court has previously explained, to\nestablish personal jurisdiction on a conspiracy theory,\nPlaintiffs must make a prima facie showing of conspiracy\nand allege facts warranting an inference that the defendant\nwas a member of the conspiracy. Terrorist Attacks I, 349\nF.Supp.2d at 805. “To plead a valid cause of action for\nconspiracy ... a plaintiff must allege the primary tort and\nfour elements: ‘(a) a corrupt agreement between two or\nmore persons, (b) an overt act in furtherance of the\nagreement, (c) the parties’ intentional participation in the\nfurtherance of a plan or purpose, and (d) the resulting\ndamage or injury.’ ” Chrysler Capital Corp., 778 F.Supp.\nat 1267 (quoting Kashi v. Gratsos, 790 F.2d 1050, 1055\n(2d Cir.1986)). Further, “[t]o warrant the inference that a\ndefendant was a member of the conspiracy, Plaintiffs\nmust show that ‘(a) the defendant had an awareness of the\neffects in New York of its activity; (b) the activity of the\nco-conspirators in New York was to the benefit of the\nout-of-state conspirators; and (c) the co-conspirators\nacting in New York acted ‘at the direction or under the\ncontrol’ of or ‘at the request of or on behalf of? the\nout-of-state defendant.” Terrorist Attacks I, 349\nF.Supp.2d at 805 (quoting Chrysler Capital Corp., 778\nF.Supp. at 1268-69). The Court must resolve the question\nof whether a conspiracy exists “based upon an\nindependent examination of the factual allegations while\nmindful of its duty to draw all factual inferences in\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017920\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We might crowd our niche, like other\ncreatures, and leave neither consumption safe to spare nor room for capital\naccumulation before diminishing returns set in. But too little investment could seem\na tougher challenge. No thrift at all, meaning not even depreciation plowback, would\nmean no growth at all. Then consumption rate would vary inversely as capital\nacceleration, just as predicted in in thrift theory. And underinvestment, meaning\nplowback of less than current cost depreciation, ought to happen about as often as\noverinvestment. If each year of underinvestment tended to fit the predictions of\nthrift theory even a little, free growth indexes should average something less than\none in the end. But they don’t. The index varies, but averages more than one as often\n\nas less in every country and period.\n\nThe explanation | suggest is already implied in that insight of two centuries ago. Just\nas overinvestment and capital glut diminish returns, underinvestment and capital\nshortage augment them until supply of capital catches up to demand. Even if there\nwere no plowback at all in some years, higher returns to capital already in place\nwould help take up the slack. There would be real danger in sustained\nunderinvestment or overinvestment. The saving grace is in market forces restoring\n\nequilibrium as investors maximize return.\n\nSummary\n\nThis gives the outline of free growth theory.

Crown Prince Wilhelm, the Kaiser's eldest son, wrote that defensive\nthinking was, “utterly foreign to the German spirit.” Bismarck’s “Iron and Blood”\nnational motto became, finally, personal for many Germans, who were prouder to\nleave their universities with a hot-red dueling scar on their faces than a subtle\nownership of Goethe in their hearts.\n\n“During the decades before the First World War,” the political scientist Steven van\nEvera has observed, “a phenomenon which may be called a ‘cult of the offensive’\nswept through Europe.”225 Wars, it was believed, would run with the same swiftness\nof trains or the new industrial sewing machines or steam-fired printing presses. It\nwas this instinct that led German generals to assure the Kaiser in 1914 that a war\nbegun in August would be finished by Christmas. English university students\nsprinted to enlistment centers in the days after the war began, worried the fight\nmight end before they tasted blood. French farmers moving from their crops to the\ntrench lines of Flanders, Russian aristocracy crowding towards the Danube, the\npoliticians who led them all - they operated, mostly, with this same conviction.\nBritish Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey’s mournful meditation on the evening of\nAugust 3,1914, the first night of the war, was a lonely one: “The lamps are going out\nall over Europe,” he said. “We shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.”\n\nThe First World War was a kind of engineering tragedy. The disaster had deep roots:\ndomestic politics, the insecurity of kings, profound colonial greed. But alsoa\nfundamental miscalculation about the nature of war and peace in an age of industry.\nMachine guns - and all the tools of industrial war, from gas to battleships - were not\nmagic tricks of fast victory or permanent peace, as some had thought. A mechanized\nmodern army wasn’t, as much as it may have seemed in theory or drills or in\nmidnight massacres in the African bush, some steam-press built for cold rolling the\narmies Belgium and Prussia and France. In fact, the weapons encouraged battle as\nthey piled endlessly in national arsenals. They tickled fears of fast or surprise attack,\neven as they gratified that weird continental hunger for violence. Hilare Beloc’s\npoetic joke, the sly we’ve got the Maxim, and they've not took on an unexpected\ncharacter when both sides had ‘em. The machine gun reached the fiery acme of its\npurpose not as a spur to end wars altogether, as Gatling once hoped, but rather\nwhen it was married to barbed wire, to shovels and to gas - and then admixed with\nthe trigger-tugging fear of 20-year-old boys. So: Sixty thousand British casualties in\none day alone, July 1, 1916 at the Somme.\n\nThe rhymes changed.

A\ntall, heavy, long-tusked elephant bull has spent the time and energy to bulk up, and can throw this weight\naround in a fight. Added on to an animal’s RHP are dynamic properties, features that require energetic\ninvestment in the moment such as the loudness or duration of a vocalization, or the height of a jump\ndisplay. These dynamic properties form the foundation of competitive interactions, and the raw material\nfor assessments. When a resource is up for grabs, and no simple rule of thumb or RHP factor trumps,\nanimals assess each others’ displays, working out whether to flee or escalate. What, if anything in a\ndisplay, reflects the signaler’s true capacity and motivation?\n\nThe Israeli evolutionary biologist Amotz Zahavi provided a simple, yet far-reaching explanation\nof honest signaling. Honesty, in the animal world, is simply about prediction. When a kob standing on his\nterritorial mound charges toward another, to what extent does this display predict that he will continue the\nattack if the opponent doesn’t flee? Is he all smoke or does the display accurately predict the follow-\nthrough? When a mantis shrimp uses his powerful claw to thump the sand at an intruder, will he go\nfurther, thumping the intruder who continues to advance? Zahavi’s solution was based in economics:\nsignals are honest if and only if they are costly to produce, where cost is relative to current condition or\nhealth. If every kob can charge even if they are blowing smoke, the charge display carries no weight. It is\npure puffery and dishonest. If every mantis shrimp can thump with its appendage, and does so regardless\nof its current power, then sand thumping loses value. For a charging display or sand thumping to carry\nvalue, they have to be costly to produce and only those in good enough condition should be able to\ntolerate the costs. Numerous studies support Zahavi’s insight, including work on insects, crabs, birds, and\ngazelles, as well as hunter-gatherers and religious institutions. Hunter-gatherers do it by showing off and\nsharing their large prey capture, whereas religions do it by showing their commitment to long and\ninvolved ritual displays.\n\nThe vast majority of animal competition is settled by means of non-lethal aggression. Animals\nadopt different strategies, use rules of thumb, and engage in assessment in order to minimize the costs of\nbattle. This is version 1.0 of HARMING OTHERS. This version operates within every animal, humans\nincluded. Over time, some animals evolved hormonal and neural upgrades that changed how individuals\nexperienced the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat, as well as changes in their willingness to take\nrisks. These upgrades inched animals closer to lethal aggression, pushed some right into it, and others\n\nover the top.\n\nHauser Chapter 1.

One relevant metaphor here is chemistry.\nAnother is abstract algebra: for instance, if we combine a component f with its “inverse” com-\nponent f~', both components are eliminated. Thus, we may think about two stages in the\ninteraction of sets of components: combination, and reduction. Reduction may be thought of\nas algebraic simplification, governed by a set of rules that apply to a newly created compound\ncomponent, based on the components that are assembled within it.\n\nFormally, suppose C1, C2,... is the set of components present in a discrete-time component-\nsystem at time t. Then, the components present at time t+1 are a subset of the set of components\nof the form\n\nReduce( Join(C;(1), ...,Ci(r)))\n\nwhere Join is a joining operation, and Reduce is a reduction operator.

Alessi stated\nhe was employed for eleven years with Mr. Epstein, from approximately 1993 through 2004. Alessi stated he\nwas the house manager, driver and house maintenance person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for\nEpstein s arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they traveled with Epstein on his private\nplane. I asked Mr. Alessi about the massages that have occurred at Epstein’s home. Alessi stated Epstein\nreceives three massages a day. Each masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that towards\nthe end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi\nstated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would occur in Epstein's\nbedroom or bathroom. He knew this because he often set up the massage tables. I asked if there were things\ngoing on other than a massage. Alessi stated that there were times towards the end of his employment that he\nwould have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage.\nAdditionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made after the massage.\n\nOn January 4, 2006 I interviewed another former houseman, Mr Alfredo Rodriguez. During a sworn\ntaped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months, from\nNovember 2004 through May of 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included being the butler,\nchauffeur, chef, houseman, run errands for Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. I asked Rodriguez about\nmasseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated Epstein would have two massages a day. Epstein would have\none massage in the morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. Rodriguez stated\nhe would be informed to expect someone and make them comfortable until either (NJ or Epstein would\nmeet with them. Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them entry into the kitchen\narea and offer them something to drink or eat. They would then be encountered by either es 0:\nEpstein. They would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if any of the masseuses\nappeared young in age. Rodriguez stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be masseuses. b6\nHe stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered a dozen roses A bic\none of the girls that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high school and were of high\nschool age. I asked Rodriguez about the massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages.\nHe would often clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and would discover massagers/vibrators\nand sex toys scattered on the floor. He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put them\naway in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's\n\nThe foregoing instrument was sworn to or affirmed State of Florida\nbefore me this 1 day of May, 2006 by County of Palm Beach\nDet Joe Recarey, who is personally known to me.\n\nSignature/Arresting Officer\n\nSignature of Police Officer (F.S.S. 117.10) Date: 05/01/2006\n\nPage of 22\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018914\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The most popular way to consume cannabis historically has been\nto smoke the flower or “bud” from the cannabis plant, which can be done using a pipe, a hand-rolled\ncigarette (often referred to as a “joint”) or a water pipe (often referred to as a “bong”). Cannabis flower\ncan also be vaporized and inhaled (using a product known as a “vaporizer”). The active compounds\nin cannabis can be extracted and concentrated into oil or waxlike substances known as concentrates.\nConcentrates, in turn, can either be vaporized and inhaled or infused into products known as “infused\nproducts.” Infused products may be applied topically, such as lotions and creams, or consumed orally,\nsuch as food and drinks (known as “edibles”), capsules, pills and tinctures.\n\nWhen smoke or vapor from heated flower or a concentrate is inhaled, the active compounds travel\ndirectly to the central nervous system and the physiological effects typically begin within one to five\nminutes. When infused products are consumed orally, the active compounds are digested in the stom-\nach and metabolized by the liver before taking effect, typically in one to two hours. Compared. to\ninhaled products, infused products deliver a smaller relative amount of cannabinoids to the blood-\nstream, but they produce longer-lasting effects.\n\nInnovative companies continue to expand the universe of cannabis products, developing brands\nwith packaging that increasingly emphasizes education about the product’s effects and appeals to main-\nstream consumers. Cannabis flower is currently the most widely sold form of cannabis, but concen-\ntrates and infused products are gaining in popularity.\n\nThe following chart shows the combined relative sales by product category for Colorado, Oregon\n\nand Washington (three states with relatively mature recreational and medical cannabis markets) for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2017.\n\nProduct Sales by Category: Q3 2017\n\n14%\n\n12%\n\n51%\n\n23%\n\n@ Flower @ Concentrates @ Edibles § Other\n\nSource: BDS Analytics\n\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC 45\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024681\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Personally, I doubt that one could\nlearn much about any of these subjects by oneself in 8 hours (or even\n8 days.) Clearly, they are teaching vocabulary and a few facts. Most of\nit will be forgotten.\n\nNow suppose the insurance industry had come to me and asked\nmy company to build a course that covered these topics. What would\nI say? (Apart from: Are you nuts?—not in 8 hours.)\n\nI would start by asking what is hard about insurance adjusting. At\nthe same time, I would have already assumed that this was basically a\ndiagnosis task.\n\nDiagnosis is a complex cognitive process that has three important\nparts. The most important part is the end result. All successful diagno-\nses result in an answer (cancer, stopped up sewer line, misfiring spark\nplug, paranoia, etc.). These results are taken from a list of acceptable\nanswers and typically are not in any way inventive. The second part\nis the case. A prototypical case for all possible results typically is com-\npared with the current case. A match determines the result. The third\npart is the evidence. To construct a case, one must gather evidence.\nWhen more than one prototypical case matches the situation, more\nevidence needs to be gathered in order to differentiate the cases that\nmight match. Doctors call this differential diagnosis.\n\nHow does one learn to do diagnosis? One must know the pro-\ntotypical case, which often takes years for one to acquire naturally\nthrough experience. One must know how to gather evidence, and\nwhat constitutes evidence, and one must know the possible set of re-\nsults. All of this takes a long time to learn. But the process itself is very\nmuch the same no matter what you are diagnosing. So, one question\nwe would ask was whether the students in the course had any experi-\nence diagnosing anything. It is easier to teach diagnosis to people who\nhave done it before even if the subject matter is different this time.\nAnother question we would ask is how much the students knew about\nthe basics of the subject matter since it is easier to teach diagnosis to\nthose who already know the subject matter.\n\nSo when I ask what is hard about insurance adjusting, I have a\ngood idea of what the answer may be. It is probably in one of these\nthree things. Is it difficult to learn all the kinds of cases that there are\nand what differentiates one from another? This depends on how many\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023815\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We believe that companies with\nwell-executed strategies will emerge as the recognized voices of the industry and will be relied on by\nconsumers for a wealth of information from product recommendations to industry news. As regulatory\nconstraints relax, we expect the currently disparate and fragmented digital media services segment to\nconsolidate into integrated publishing, mobile and e-commerce offerings.

I said above that these are cognitive pro-\ncesses. So let’s look at them from that perspective. Let’s start with the\nanalytic processes.\n\nWhat does it mean to say that diagnosis is a cognitive process? It\nmeans that there are steps and these steps are based in thought rather\nthan in action. The first step may be to gather evidence, for example.\nWhile this seems like a physical act, and often it is, it is actually a\nmental act. Evidence can be gathered by asking questions, by looking\ncarefully at a scene, by listening to sounds, or by taking blood tests.\nThere are many ways to gather evidence and typically the physical\nmanifestations of evidence gathering bear no real relationship to one\nanother. Evidence gathering is a mental act, although physical actions\nmay be involved. It is a mental act that is part of a set of complex men-\ntal processes that, of course, include reasoning about the evidence,\nchecking the validity of the evidence, comparing known information\nwith previous cases that are similar, and so on. Diagnosis is a complex\nmental process. Teaching diagnosis matters because getting good at\ndiagnosis can make you a good mother, a good teacher, a good detec-\ntive, a good nearly anything you can think of. The process of diagnosis\nis constant in our mental lives.\n\nAre all 12 of the processes listed above like this? Clearly the oth-\ner analytic processes are very similar. Planning is a mental activity\nthat one gets better at by doing it. Whether you are planning a party\nor planning a career, the process involves thinking about steps and\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023801\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It was complicit in the spread of fake news\nand foreign interference in our elections, and is partly to blame for the rise of political\npolarisation through its echo chambers and filter bubbles. The company has been selling the\nprivate data of millions of users around the world to select companies — most notoriously\nCambridge Analytica, who used the information to meddle in the US presidential elections and\nBritain's EU referendum. And Facebook was accused of behaving like ‘digital gangsters’ by the\nHouse of Commons Digital Select Committee, led by Damian Collins MP, who claimed\nZuckerberg has willfully misled lawmakers over fake news and data malpractice. Facebook is\n\nbuilt on an essentially unethical business model, and the buck stops with Zuck.\n\nThat's the case against Mark Zuckerberg. But let’s keep things in perspective, say his\ndefenders. Facebook has done more than any other organisation in the world to connect people\nthrough technology, allowing more than 2.2 billion users so far — that’s 30 percent of the world’s\npopulation — to share their lives with friends and family around the world — all for free. And let’s\nnot forget that Facebook has been a vital tool for social and political organisation, from the Arab\nSpring to Obama's presidential campaign. The world is a complex and messy place and while\nit's convenient to scapegoat a single CEO for our polarised politics, the fact is there were\nmultiple causes for Brexit and Trump. Of course, there are problems at Facebook and Mark\nZuckerberg is keenly aware of them. In January 2018, he made a promise to fix Facebook,\nadmitting that the organisation makes too many errors and listing his priorities as ‘protecting our\ncommunity from abuse and hate, defending against interference by nation states, or making\nsure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent’. Much of what we are reading about\nFacebook is old news. Zuckerberg is essentially an idealist and we should at least give him the\n\nbenefit of the doubt as he seeks to rebuild the world’s trust in Facebook.\n\nThat's the argument of Zuckerberg’s defenders.

For me, it was a risk. He was a\nfamously combative questioner, a bit like Sam Donaldson at White House\nbriefings, or Jeremy Paxman and John Humphreys in Britain.\n\nOn the night of July 13, I drove to the television studio in Tel Aviv. Mishal\nconfronted me with Yedio?’s version of events. I was angry, and showed it.\n“This report was not some night editor’s mishap,” I said. “It was authorized by\nthe highest levels of a mass-circulation newspaper which 1s power-drunk,\ncorrupted by power, and manipulative. The so-called ‘story’ was an amateurish\nand distorted depiction of a chief-of-staff who sees wounded soldiers, turns his\nback, deserts them and flies away. That is an evil, vain falsehood.” As Mishal\npressed me about the allegation that I had fled, I cited, by name, other officers\nwho had been there with me and had confirmed precisely the opposite. I had left\nTze’elim, along with Amnon Lipkin, a full 50 minutes after the missiles struck,\nI said. And only after the helicopters had arrived, the injuries had been treated\nand the choppers were evacuating the wounded. “A chief of staffs job is not to\ntreat the wounded, when others are doing that already,” I added. My\nresponsibility was “to keep my head, and ensure a safe and speedy medical\nevacuation.” That was what I’d done. “I’ve given years of my life to serving this\ncountry,” I said. “I have been shot at. I have shot men dead from as close as I\nam to you now. How did the hand that wrote these things against me not\ntremble?”\n\nIt was certainly high drama. But it was not an act. The way that I’d gone\nafter Yediot prompted some pundits to suggest my skin was too thin. One\ncommentator even said I was obviously not suited to politics. Yet what mattered\nmost to me was what the rest of Israel felt: people who were not reporters or\neditors, commentators or politicians. Opinion polls the day afterwards showed\nthat something like 80 percent of Israelis believed what I’d said. I think this was\nonly partly due to the details of the argument I made. When you’re under such\nclose, direct scrutiny, I’m sure viewers have an innate sense of whether what\nthey are hearing is the truth.\n\nAlmost as soon as I’d got home from the interview, the phone rang. It was\nsomeone who, of course, already knew it was the truth: Yitzhak Rabin. “Ehud,”\nhe said, “you did well.

It is costly in two ways: the\npunisher loses money he could have kept, and the donor loses money that he unfairly kept in his previous\nexchange.\n\nWhen donors kept a significantly larger portion of the original sum, observers punished, paying\nthe costs. They also reported feeling good about taking down the cheapskates. Where was this honey hit\nto the brain coming from?\n\nTo figure this out, Fehr and his colleagues put people in a brain scanner and used a technique\ncalled Positron Emission Tomography or PET. This type of scanning provides a picture of how much\nglucose is used up by different brain areas during a task. Higher glucose consumption occurs when there\nis higher activity in a brain region. When punishers decided to punish a selfish donor, glucose\nconsumption increased in a region of the brain associated with reward: the dorsal striatum. This region is\nalso active when you eat ice cream, earn money, and solve an unexpected problem. Punishers incurred a\nfinancial cost, but gained emotional elation and internal reward. It turns out that giving someone his just\ndeserts feels like eating dessert, but without the caloric gain.\n\nWhen distinctively promiscuous punishment evolved, it transformed our capacity to cooperate\nand to maintain conformity to social norms. It provided us with the tools to not only repair a puncture in\nthe system of norms, but to feel good about the costs personally incurred. When we punish, we have\nserved justice and served ourselves a helping of the brain’s rewards. The fossil record doesn’t capture\nwhen we evolved the capacity to punish, as skulls and bones, stone tools, and even paintings are silent on\nwhy someone received a spear through the head — perhaps punished for a wrong doing or perhaps an\nenemy, a competitor interested in the same resources, or a suspected lover. No one will ever know. What\nwe do know is that other primates never punish cheaters who break the norms of cooperation, whereas\nhunter-gatherers dotting the continents do. Though people living today as hunter-gatherers are not perfect\nreplicas of what life was like way back when, they indicate that before we had sophisticated technology,\nagriculture, and permanent residences, we had the capacity to minimize the costs of the sucker’s problem.\nWhenever this capacity emerged in human evolution, it provided a critical part of the solution to the\nproblem of large-scale cooperation among unrelated strangers. With many eyes on the look out for\ncheaters, and a capacity to take out or ostracize the free riders, cooperation emerged as a stable solution to\nproblems that are unsolvable at an individual level, including group defense and the acquisition of costly\nresources. Punishment enabled humans to live in large, stable cooperative societies, many of whom are\nunrelated strangers.\n\nThis momentous event in the history of cooperation carried with it a serious cost, bringing\naggression and reward into closer proximity, with the costs of attacking others overshadowed by the\n\nbenefits. As I discuss in greater detail in the next chapter, this economic transformation created, as an\n\nHauser Chapter 1.

Poitras also\nasked the hacktavist Jacob Appelbaum to help her interview Snowden about the NSA’s\noperations. She later said that she needed someone with technical expertise in government\nsurveillance to test the bona fides of Citizen 4. She believed that Appelbaum, who had\nparticipated in her anti-NSA presentations in 2012, qualified for the position.\n\nAs it turns out, Appelbaum was already known to Snowden. Appelbaum had communicated\nwith Snowden under his Oahu Crypto party alias about an obscure piece of software just a few\nafter Snowden had met with Runa Sandvik in Hawaii in 2012. Appelbaum, after all, was\nSandvik’s long-time ally in developing the use of TOR software. However he learned about him,\nSnowden allowed Appelbaum to put to him detailed questions to concerning the secret operations\nof the NSA before he met with Poitras and Greenwald in Hong Kong. Indeed, Poitras joined him\nin asking Snowden via encrypted emails, such questions as: “What are some of the big\nsurveillance programs that are active today and how do international partners aid the NSA?”\n“Does the NSA partner with other nations, like Israel?” and “Do private companies help the\nNSA?” Snowden answered them all to the satisfaction of Appelbaum and Poitras. (The interview\nwas published on June16, 2013 with Snowden’s approval on the website of Der Spiegel, the\nGerman weekly, which had also published the Wikileaks documents.)\n\nEven though the days were ticking away while Snowden was waiting for him in Hong Kong,\nGreenwald still had to overcome a final hurdle at the Guardian. He needed to get a green light to\ngo to Hong Kong from Janine Gibson, the editor of the Guardian website, who was based in New\nYork. Under Gibson’s leadership, the Guardian's website effectively “gone into the business of\npublishing government secrets,” as Guardian columnist Michael Wolff pointed out. Most of\nthese secrets had been supplied by Manning via Wikileaks. Few, if any of these previous\ndocuments the Guardian published were highly-classified and none were SCI top secret\ndocuments. The NSA documents Greenwald had received from Citizen 4 were another matter.\nThey contained the sort of SCI communications intelligence data that no major newspaper had\never published before. Their disclosure could even result in journalists being imprisoned since\nboth U.S. and British law criminalized the disclosure by anyone of communications intelligence.\nAs a lawyer, Greenwald recognized this danger. On the other hand, the NSA documents were far\nmore explosive than the Wikileaks material, and promised an even greater spike in circulation. So\nGreenwald assumed that Gibson would be willing to authorize the publication of the\ndocuments—and provide the expenses for his trip to Hong Kong to meet the source.\n\nHe flew from Rio to New York on May 30, 2013 to meet in person with Gibson, who had\nconcerns about publishing what purported to be top secret documents that came from an\nanonymous source. For one thing, she was also not willing to go along with Citizen 4’s demand\nthat the Guardian publish his personal manifesto alongside the documents. Aside from its shrill\nand alarming tone, it sounded, as she told Greenwald, “a bit Ted Kaczynski-ish.” She was\nreferring to Ted Kaczinski, the deranged mathematician who had maimed or killed 23 people with\nanonymous mail bombs between 1978 and 1995. Like Citizen 4/Snowden, Kaczynski had\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020247\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But now, in an age where connection decides\nso much, control over gates has a unique leverage. When you finally can feel out the\ntopology of our age, when in anger or frustration or hope or wonder you are ready\nto act, then this is among the first questions you have to ask. I’m on the topology now,\nwhere are the gates.\n\nGates in an age of instant, everywhere, smart networks are, you can imagine,\ndifferent from the ones that girded Troy or the Tang dynasty. It’s not merely that\nthey’re made of bits and algorithms not bricks, it’s that the underlying nature of\ntheir power is different. The most visible evidence of this distinction was first\nobserved by economists a couple of decades ago, as they contemplated the fortunes\nof the information age, wealth that had been assembled at an eye-watering pace.\nUnlike traditional businesses which turned over time into competitive slugfests with\nvery low profits, many high-tech firms seemed to run with a new, nearly inverted\nlogic. “Our understanding of how markets and businesses operate was passed down\nto us more than a century ago by figures such as Alfred Marshall,” the economist\nBrian Arthur wrote in the Harvard Business Review in the summer of 1996. “It is an\nunderstanding based squarely upon the assumption of diminishing returns:\nproducts or companies that get ahead in a market eventually run into\nlimitations.”23! Marshall had been the first to name this phenomenon in the 1890s:\n“Diminishing Returns”. As any line of business gets more competitive, the profits -\nor “returns” to investment - shrink. Henry Ford invents a car, he has no competition\nat first and fairly prints money. But Ford doesn’t enjoy his monopoly for long. Pretty\nsoon the Dodge brothers follow him into business, as does Walter Chrysler and then\na cascade of new auto companies. They all take a piece of the pie; profits for every\ncarmaking firm diminish. Then the Japanese pile in. The Koreans show up. These\nnew companies compete with growing intensity. Marginal profits decline for\neveryone. Then the Chinese. And the Indians.\n\nAs he studied the balance sheets of infotech firms, Arthur noticed something\nstrange: Returns were increasing over time. As their markets matured some\ncompanies made more marginal money with each passing day, not less. Marshall’s\n19t Century industrial economics had never contemplated such a lucrative\narrangement. “Increasing returns,” Arthur explained, “are the tendency for that\nwhich is ahead to get farther ahead. They are mechanisms of positive feedback that\noperate—within markets, businesses, and industries—to reinforce that which gains\nsuccess or aggravate that which suffers loss.” In other words: Winner takes all. No\nsecond place. Arthur was thinking, as he wrote, about the then-nascent computer\nsoftware business. Say for instance, Arthur sent you a copy of his paper to read\nbefore publication as a Microsoft Word document. Well, if you wanted to see what\nhe had to say, you'd pretty much have to own a copy of Word yourself.

Breakeven rates of inflation narrowed following the Fed communications\ndue to tighter monetary conditions in the face of slowing US economic data, and risk\nasset bears responded in force, suggesting that Janet Yellen had “broken up” with\ninvestors and that it would be prudent to sell “before it’s too late”.\n\nWe agree that the changing reaction function of the Fed is likely not supportive of\nfurther substantial US equity upside and may be viewed as the Fed now providing a\nshort call option on the S&P 500. However, in our view, it is premature to conclude\nfrom last week’s developments that the “Yellen put” is dead. We see its strike as\ndeclining but would not underestimate Yellen’s dovish inclinations in a shock or the\ncapacity for the Fed to still remain credibly on hold as long as the US economy is not\n“running hot”.\n\nIn short, we see monetary policy as now providing a “collar” (long put / short call} on a\nUS equity market that has already shown a propensity over the past year for getting\ntrapped in record tight trading ranges.' Other factors may also conspire to create a\nsummer range-trade for US equities, namely (i) fiscal policy, where gridlock likely caps\nequity upside but lingering policy hope floors the downside, and (ii) positioning, where\nthe risk of continued “fragility events” (potentially exacerbated by stretched quant\nfund/short vol positioning) meets cashed-up investors still accustomed to buying dips.\n\nTug of war between fragile market/stretched positioning and cashed-up dip-buyers\nAs we have noted recently, US equities have displayed a historically unusual tendency to\njump rapidly from calm to stress and back (“fragility”), with the recent Tech sell-off and\nrebound the latest example. For example, in the past year, the S&P 500 has seen\n5sigma declines (3 in total—Brexit, Sep-16, May-17) occur 20x more frequently than\nover the prior 90 years or so. The increased frequency of these “fragility events” is in\npart due to vol failing to remain high post a spike as equity market participants continue\nto aggressively “buy the dip” and in the process reset vol lower.\n\nHistorically low vol alongside consistently upward trending equity markets and low cross\nasset correlations could be creating stretched positioning across markets. For example,\nupward trending equities on historically low vol may be pushing CTA equity positioning\nto near record levels (Chart 7). Risk parity portfolios could be increasing their leverage\ndue to low vol as well as low cross asset correlation (Chart 8). And lastly, inverse VIX\nETPs have seen increased open interest as performance has swelled on the back of\ncontinued declines in vol and attractive term structure risk premia (Chart 9).\n\nShould vol spike again alongside a reversal in equity price momentum and a rise in cross\nasset correlations, then unwinds from these strategies could exacerbate market fragility.\nHowever, this must be weighed against an investor base that has plenty of cash on hand\n(Chart 10) and their potentially fickle but still-intact tendency to view any equity market\ndip as an alpha opportunity.\n\n' For example, the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded in its tightest trading range in over\n110 years in Jan-17; this followed a record in the S&P 500 ending Sep-16 for the longest\nstretch of trading within a range of 1.77% since 1928.\n\nBankof America\n\n4 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 20 June 2017 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014975\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The most visible manifestation of this strategy is\nthe Party-state’s effort to influence Hollywood in a bid to advance China’s global soft\npower agenda.\n\nAmerican popular culture has enjoyed worldwide influence for decades and is a key element of\nthe country’s soft power. However, by the end of the Hu Jintao era, China’s leaders had begun\ncalling for their country, too, to become a soft power leader, a theme Xi Jinping has continued\nto stress. The subsequent surge in Chinese spending on entertainment, or its “cultural\nindustries,” as it calls this sector, amid flat revenues in the United States, has made China’s\nmarket a compelling one for Hollywood, despite continued quotas limiting the number\nforeign films that can be shown in China. In 2017, the Chinese box office reached $7.9 billion\non growth of 21 percent, whereas the US market grew just 2 percent to $11.1 billion.°° (Foreign\nfilms account for roughly half of China’s total, most of which is attributable to Hollywood.)\n\nIn the 2010s, in addition to investing in its domestic film industry and maintaining\n\na restrictive import regime, the Chinese government encouraged the country’s media\ncompanies to enter into alliances or attempt to acquire outright American entertainment\ncompanies. Collectively, these strategies have raised concerns about self-censorship, the\nco-opting of the American film industry to advance Chinese narratives, and ultimately, the\nrisk that the industry will lose its independence.\n\nHollywood, represented by the Motion Picture Association of America, has long cultivated\nclose ties to the American government, which it has used to open access to China. For\nexample, media scholar Aynne Kokas notes that in 2012, Vice President Joe Biden met with\nthen Chinese vice president Xi Jinping to discuss China’s quota on foreign films.*! During\nXi’s visit, Biden also helped broker an agreement between DreamWorks and a group of\nChinese investors. Ultimately, in response to these efforts and WTO action, China increased\nits annual quota of imported films from twenty to thirty-four.\n\nFilm studios can attempt to circumvent the import quota by coproducing films with Chinese\npartners. This can invite censorship directly into the production process, potentially\naffecting what global audiences see, as opposed to censorship that affects only what the\nChinese market sees.*? Examples abound of studios that have cast Chinese actors, developed\nand/or cut scenes specific to the Chinese market, or preemptively eliminated potentially\nobjectionable references to China from scripts even when source material has called for it.\n\nAware of the Chinese market’s growing centrality to the film industry, major studios are\nalso reluctant to produce any film that would upset China, even if that specific film was\n\nSection 7\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020570\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

DERSHOWITZ\nCOME NOW Jane Doe No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2 (the “current victims”), by and through\nundersigned counsel, to file this response to the Supplement to Reply in Support of Motion for\nLimited Intervention by Alan Dershowitz (DE 317-1). Dershowitz claims that an affidavit\nsubmitted by Jane Doe No. 3 in support of an unrelated pleading proves that she is “lying with\nrespect to her claims against [him].” DE 317-1 at 1. The affidavit proves nothing of the sort.\nIndeed, if recent pleadings show anything, it is that Dershowitz continues to hide the truth about\nhis activities.\nBefore turning to the specifics of what Dershowitz argues in his supplement, it is even\nmore important to consider what he fails to argue. In neither his original reply (DE 306) nor his\nrecent supplement (DE 317-1) has Dershowitz provided specific evidence to contest Jane Doe\nNo. 3’s allegations that he sexually molested her. This omission is revealing, because\nDershowitz has repeatedly claimed in the media that he has irrefutable proof that her allegations\nare false. For example, on January 7, 2015, on the Fox Business (Lou Dobbs) program,\nDershowitz stated: “I did the investigation in a day and was able to prove through all kinds of\n1\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 3 of 34\nrecords that I couldn’t have been in these places. The woman is a serial liar. If [Cassell and\nEdwards] had done that investigation, they would have come to the same conclusion.” 1\nSimilarly, on January 8, 2015, on the Greta van Susteren show on FOX, Dershowitz claimed:\n“Now I can prove through documentary evidence that I was never at the times and places she\n[Jane Doe No. 3] alleges she had sex with me.” 2\nYet despite having publicly claimed to have\n“all kinds of records” and “documentary evidence” that “prove” Jane Doe No. 3 is lying,\nDershowitz has yet to produce a single document to this Court. Dershowitz’s intransigence is\nnot limited to this case, as he has also refused to comply with discovery requests in a parallel\ndefamation action in state court. His refusal has led to a pending motion to compel. See\nPlaintiff’s Motion to Compel Production of Documents, Edwards v. Dershowitz, No. CACE 15-\n000072 (Feb. 23, 2015) (attached as Exhibit 1) (“despite having had 45 days to gather materials\nthat allegedly provide ‘absolute proof’ than he has never even met Jane Doe No. 3 – and despite\nhaving told numerous media sources that he had already collected such information –\nDershowitz has provided none of these documents . . . .”). 3\nThe Court should draw the obvious\ninference that Dershowitz, despite making broad claims to the media, has no such evidence to\nproduce – because Jane Doe No. 3’s allegations are true.\n1 http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/3976630676001/alan-dershowitz-the-woman-is-a-serialliar/?\n- sp=show-clips.\n2 http://radio.foxnews.com/2015/01/08/greta-alan-dershowitz-this-time-its-personal/.\n3 Jane Doe No. 3 explained in her earlier response that the Court should not allow\nDershowitz to intervene here because he can protect his (alleged) reputational interests in the\npending defamation action. DE 291 at 11-12). The Court may be interested to learn that\nDershowitz has recently filed a counterclaim against Edwards and Cassell for defaming him in\nthat action – suggesting he can litigate his reputational interests there, and thus has no need to do\nso here.\n2\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 4 of 34\nIn his most recent supplemental filing with this court (DE 317-1), Dershowitz twists the\nfacts and jumps to conclusions in service of his crusade against Jane Doe No. 3. For example,\nDershowitz notes that Jane Doe No. 3 told attorney Edwards before April 2011 that Dershowitz\nhad abused her, but then says “she and Edwards sat on this highly charged accusation for three\nyears and eight months before first using it in their [sic] pleading filed on December 30, 2014.\nThis constitutes laches that prejudiced . . . Dershowitz . . . .” DE 317-1 at 2. Dershowitz ignores\nthe key fact that in April 2011, attorney Edwards did not represent Jane Doe No. 3. Accordingly,\nhe could not “sit” on her claims against Dershowitz because he was not empowered, at that time,\nto pursue them. 4\nWith regard to the claim of laches, Dershowitz argues that he has been prejudiced\nbecause if the allegations had been filed earlier, “he would have been in a far better position to\nsecure travel and other records needed to disprove these charges.” DE 317-1 at 2. But, as noted\nabove, Dershowitz has already told worldwide news media that he has already collected all of the\nrecords and can provide irrefutable, documentary proof that Jane Doe No. 3 is lying. For\nexample, Dershowitz has told the Boston Globe that “he will use his travel and credit card\nrecords, which he said he has fastidiously saved, to refute the allegations against him.” 5\n4 Nor did Jane Doe No. 3 sit on any claims against Dershowitz, notably claims relating to\nthe CVRA case. In 2011, Jane Doe No. 3 lacked legal counsel regarding the CVRA claim. It\nwas not until her recent return from Australia to the United States that she understood the claims\ninvolved in the CVRA action and obtained legal counsel to pursue them. See DE 310-1 at 8, ¶\n57.\n5 “Dershowitz ‘thrilled’ to be sued for defamation,” Boston Globe (Jan. 7, 2015),\navailable at, http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/01/06/sued-for-defamation-dershowitzthrilled-chance-question-lawyers-sex-crime-accuser/21QibSrwNC343eKMadWNeL/story.html.\n3\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 5 of 34\nDershowitz can’t have it both ways – simultaneously claiming he has the records and that he is\nharmed in collecting them – and the Court should not credit his conflicting positions.\nCONCLUSION\nThe Court should deny Dershowitz’s motion to intervene.\nDATED: March 24, 2015\nRespectfully Submitted,\n/s/ Bradley J.

EDWARDS and PAUL G.\nCAS SELL,\nvs.\nPlaintiff(s),\nALAN M. DERSHOWITZ,\nDefendant(s).\nPLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO COMPEL PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS\nPlaintiffs, Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G. Cassell, by through their undersigned\nattorneys, move to compel production of documents relevant to this action that defendant Alan\nM. Dershowitz has refused to produce.\nDershowitz has told numerous media sources that he has collected documents that\nprovide \"absolute proof\" that he has not sexually abused a minor woman known as \"Jane Doe\nNo. 3.\" And yet despite having received a valid discovery request for these and other related\ndocuments more than 45 days ago, Dershowitz has refused to produce these documents to\nEdwards and Cassell. Indeed, he has refused to produce any documents to them. Accordingly,\nthe Court should direct Dershowitz to produce these materials forthwith, as well as order him to\npay reasonable costs and attorneys' fees necessitated by his refusal to make any appropriate\ndocument production.\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 9 of 34\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nPlaintiffs' Motion to Compel Production of Documents\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\nOn December 30, 2014, Jane Doe No. 3 filed a motion (and later a corrected motion)\nseeking to join a case in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Jane Doe\nNos. 1 and 2 v. United States, No. 9:08-cv-80736. She was represented by two attorneys who\nspecialize in (among other things) representing crime victims, Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G.\nCassell. The case involved an attempt to rescind a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) barring the\nprosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and his criminal associates on grounds that the victims' rights\nunder the Crime Victims Rights Act (CVRA) had been violated.\nIn her corrected motion, Docket Entry (DE) 280, Jane Doe No. 3 briefly proffered the\ncircumstances that would qualify her as a \"victim\" eligible to assert rights under the CVRA. See\n18 U.S.C. 3771(e) (defining a CVRA \"victim\"). Jane Doe No. 3 briefly explained that when she\nwas a minor, Jeffrey Epstein had trafficked her to Prince Andrew and Alan Dershowitz (among\nothers) for sexual purposes. The motion also provided specific reasons why Jane Doe No. 3's\nparticipation was relevant to the case, including the pending discovery issues regarding Prince\nAndrew and Dershowitz. See DE 280 at 9-10 (explaining several reasons participation of new\nvictims was relevant to existing issues).\nAfter the motion was filed, Dershowitz made numerous media statements about the filing\n— and defamatory statements about Edwards and Cassell. For example, on CNN on January 5,\n2015, Dershowitz stated that Edwards and Cassell are \"prepared to lie, cheat, and steal. These\nare unethical lawyers.\"\n2\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 10 of\n34\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nPlaintiffs' Motion to Compel Production of Documents\nhttp://www. cnn.com/videos/world/20 1 5/0 1 /0 5 /wrn-uk-sex-abuse- al legations-alan-dershowitzintv.\ncnn\nIn the course of defaming Edwards and Cassell, Dershowitz also made numerous\nrepresentations that he had collected documents proving that he had never even met Jane Doe\nNo. 3, much less sexually abused her. For example, on the same CNN program on January 5,\nDershowitz stated: \"No, never met her [Jane Doe No. 3], I didn't know what she looked like until\nI saw her photograph. . . . I have a superb memory. I have a memory of not having met her. I\ndid not meet her. And believe me, I remember everybody I've ever had sex with. . . . I can prove\nit by flight records. I can prove it by my travel records.\" Id. (emphasis added). Dershowitz\nwent on to say that disproving Jane Doe No. 3's allegations was a simple task requiring about\none hour of work: \"If they [Edwards and Cassell] had just done an hours' worth of work, they\nwould have seen she is lying through her teeth.\" Id.\nThat same day, on NBC's Today Show, Dershowitz repeated his claim that it was a\nsimple matter to collect documents disproving allegations made by Jane Doe No. 3:\nHer lawyers Paul Cassell, a former Federal judge and Brad Edwards, deliberately\nand willfully filed this pleading which they knew I had no opportunity to respond\nto in court, without doing any investigation, if they had simply investigated the\nmanifests of the airplanes, if they had checked my travel records, if they had\nasked me and I could have given the names of these people who are witnesses,\nthey would know the stories, totally, completely false.\nhttps://www.voutube.com/watch?v—ZXePKTwsOf0\n3\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 11 of\n34\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nPlaintiffs' Motion to Compel Production of Documents\nTwo days later, Dershowitz told Lou Dobbs on Fox Business, that he had already\ncompleted his investigation and had \"all kinds of records\" proving that Jane Doe No. 3 was a\nliar:\nThey [Edwards and Cassell] did it for crass financial and political reasons. More\nto the point is [what] they didn't do... I did the investigation in a day and was able\nto prove through all kinds of records that I couldn't have been in these places.\nThe woman is a serial liar. If they had done that investigation, they would have\ncome to the same conclusion.\nhttp://video.foxbusiness.com/v/3976630676001/alan-dershowitz-the-woman-is-a-serial-liar/?\nsp=show-clips.\nIn response to the CVRA motion that Edwards and Cassell had made for Jane Doe No. 3,\non January 5, 2015, Dershowitz filed a motion to intervene in the case to respond, along with an\naffidavit claiming that he had not sexually abused Jane Doe No. 3. In that affidavit, Dershowitz\nstated that \"[i]f [Edwards and Cassell] had done any reasonable investigation of their client's\nfalse allegations, they would have found absolute proof that I did not [sexually abuse her] ...\neven the most minimal of investigation would have proven conclusively that I could not have\nhad sex with their client on Mr Epstein's island, in New Mexico or on the airplanes; and that I\ndid not have sex with her in his New York or Palm Beach homes.\" DE 282-1 at ¶ 8.\nOn January 6, 2015, plaintiffs Edwards and Cassell filed their complaint in this action,\nalleging a massive public assault on their character by defendant Dershowitz. On January 9,\n2015, Edwards and Cassell filed their Initial Request for Production to Defendant Alan M.\nDershowitz. They requested production of documents along the lines that Dershowitz suggested\nhe had already collected. For example, Request for Production (RFP) No. 9 sought \"[copies of\n4\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 12 of\n34\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nPlaintiffs' Motion to Compel Production of Documents\nany and all 'absolute proof as described in paragraph 8 of the sworn declaration of Alan M.\nDershowitz.\"\nOn February 11, 2015, counsel for Edwards and Cassell sent an email to counsel for\nDershowitz, noting that discovery production was past due and inquiring as to whether a motion\nto compel would be necessary. That same day, a paralegal for Cole, Scott & Kissane confirmed\nthat appropriate production would be made by the end of the week. Shortly after, an attorney for\nDershowitz disavowed that commitment, and indicated that Dershowitz would make his\nproductions by February 23, 2015.\nOn February 23, 2015 — 45 days after the discovery requests had been served —\nDershowitz responded. With regard to the request for production of documents, Dershowitz\nproduced no documents whatsoever. Instead, he made a vague commitment to produce\nunspecified documents at some unspecified time in the future. Illustrative of Dershowitz's\nfailure to make any substantive production is the following request for production and\nDershowitz's answer:\n9. Copies of any and all \"absolute proof' as described in paragraph 8 of\nthe sworn Declaration of Alan M. Dershowitz.\nRESPONSE: Defendant objects to this Document Request to the extent\nthat Plaintiffs seek to alter or shift any burdens of proof as a matter of law in this\naction. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing specific objections and\nGeneral Objections, Defendant responds that he will produce all responsive, nonprivileged\ndocuments currently in his possession, custody or control.\nDershowitz made the same evasive response — \"Defendant responds that he will produce\"\nunspecified \"non-privileged documents\" — to multiple discovery requests. See Dershowitz\n5\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 13 of\n34\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nPlaintiffs' Motion to Compel Production of Documents\nResponse to Requests for Production 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23.\nTo permit the Court to review the extent of Dershowitz's evasions, a copy of his responses is\nattached to this pleading as Exhibit A.\nIn short, despite having had 45 days to gather materials that allegedly provide \"absolute\nproof' that he has never even met Jane Doe No. 3 — and despite having told numerous media\nsources that he had already collected such information — Dershowitz has produced none of these\ndocuments to Edwards and Cassell. He has also made blanket assertions of a variety of\nprivileges, but has produced no privilege logs.\nCONCLUSION\nAccordingly, Edwards and Cassell request:\n1. That Dershowitz be directed to produce all materials covered by the discovery\nrequests forthwith;\n2. That Dershowitz be held to have waived any and all otherwise applicable privileges as\na consequence of his failure to timely file a privilege log; and\n3. That Dershowitz be ordered to pay reasonable costs and attorneys' fees associated\nwith the need to file this motion to compel.\nCERTIFICATE OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO RESOLVE\nPlaintiffs have attempted in good faith to resolve the discovery issues presented in this\nmotion (and others) as evidenced by the letter attached as Exhibit B.

Copies of any and all documents evidencing the presence of \"members of Mr. Epstein's\nlegal team\", as described in paragraph 5 of the sworn Declaration of Alan M.

Paragraph 5 of\nthe sworn Declaration of Alan M. Dershowitz refers to plane travel by members of Mr. Epstein's\nlegal team after 2002 and therefore Defendant further objects because this Document Request\ndoes not seek documents relevant to this action or documents reasonably calculated to lead to the\ndiscovery of admissible evidence.\n8.

Copies of any and all documents tending to establish that President Clinton has never\nvisited Jeffrey Epstein's island, Little Saint James, as described in paragraph 8 of the sworn\nDeclaration of Alan M.

Dershowitz, which expressly states that \"on information and belief I\nhave been advised that Secret Service records would confirm that President Clinton has never set\nfoot on that island.\" (Emphasis added). Subject to and without waiving the foregoing specific\nobjections and the General Objections, Defendant responds that he has no responsive, nonprivileged\ndocuments.\n6\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 22 of\n34\n12. Copies of any and all documents evidencing that Jane Doe #3 \"has also told lies about\nmany world leaders\" as described in paragraph 8 of the sworn Declaration of Alan M.\nDershowitz.\nRESPONSE:\nDefendant objects to this Document Request because it misstates paragraph 8 of the sworn\nDeclaration of Alan M. Dershowitz, which expressly states that \"on information and belief [Jane\nDoe #3] has also told lies about many world leaders.\" (Emphasis added). Defendant further\nobjects to this Document Request because it seeks documents already in Plaintiffs' possession\nand/or that are publicly available. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing specific\nobjections and the General Objections, Defendant responds by reference to statements by Jane\nDoe #3 reflected in the media, which are equally available to Plaintiffs.\n13. Copies of any and all documents evidencing that \"the State Attorney in Palm Beach\nCounty dropped a case that she sought to bring based on an assessment by the investigating\ndetective regarding the 'victim's lack of credibility'\" including a copy of the letter reflecting this\ndecision as described in paragraph 8 of the sworn Declaration of Alan M.

Copies of all pages of Passports held by you at any time during the past 12 years.\nRESPONSE:\nDefendant objects to this Document Request as seeking sensitive personal information and\ndocuments that are not relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.\n8\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 24 of\n34\n18. Copies of any and all documents reflecting that Jane Doe #3 has ever willfully engaged in\nprostitution.\nRESPONSE:\nDefendant objects to this Document Request as vague because Defendant is not in a position to\ndetermine the willful nature of Jane Doe #3's prostitution. Defendant further objects to this\nDocument Request because Jane Doe #3 has repeatedly and publicly asserted that she gave her\nbody for sexual activity for hire after the age of 18 and agreed to secure other persons for the\npurpose of prostitution or for any other lewd or indecent act and therefore the Document Request\nis unduly burdensome.\n19. Copies of any and all documents reflecting that Jane Doe #3 is either a liar or has\nperjured herself in any way.\nRESPONSE:\nSubject to and without waiving the General Objections, Defendant responds that he will produce\nall responsive, non-privileged documents currently in his possession, custody or control.\n20.

Therefore Defendant objects to this Document Request to the extent that it\npurports to seek documents relating to any time before 1999 or after 2002.

When this occurs, even if responsive information is\nforthcoming, we have no guarantee that you have not unilaterally withheld information\nsubject to the stated objections or claims of privilege; in other words, it shields the very\nexistence of responsive matters from discovery without any ability to assess the merits\nof the objection or claim of privilege as applied to the ostensibly protected matters. A\nfederal court described the problem:\nThis Court has on several occasions \"disapproved [of] the practice of\nasserting a general objection 'to the extent' it may apply to particular\nrequests for discovery.\" This Court has characterized these types of\nobjections as \"worthless for anything beyond delay of the discovery.\" Such\nobjections are considered mere \"hypothetical or contingent possibilities,\"\nwhere the objecting party makes '\"no meaningful effort to show the\napplication of any such theoretical objection' to any request for discovery.\"\nc-reac\nEXHIBIT B\n111■\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 30 of\n34\nThomas E. Scott, Jr., Esq.\nRe: Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz\nFebruary 25, 2015\nPage 2\nThus, this Court has deemed such \"ostensible\" objections waived or [has]\ndeclined to consider them as objections.\nSonnino v. Univ. of Kan. Hosp. Auth., 221 F.R.D. 661, 666-67 (D. Kan. 2004) (citations\nomitted).\nOf course, where claims of privilege are involved, the response must include a privilege\nlog enabling us (and the court, if necessary) to assess the applicability of the privilege\nclaimed. See Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.280(b)(5). Under Florida law, \"the burden is upon the\nparty asserting a privilege to establish the existence of each element of the privilege in\nquestion.\" Fla. Sheriff's Self-Ins. Fund v. Escambia County, 585 So.2d 461, 463 (Fla. 1'1\nDCA 1991).\nGeneral or blanket objections are inappropriate in and of themselves: \"A 'blanket'\nobjection to interrogatories consisting of many, separate questions is insufficient.\nObjections in such a case should be addressed 'to a particular interrogatory or class of\ninterrogatories, not to the interrogatories in general.\" Twadell v. Twadell, 199 So. 2d\n501 (Fla. 4th DCA 1967) (quoting Carson v. City of Ft. Lauderdale, 173 So.2d 743 (Fla.\n2d DCA 1965)).\nThe same principles apply to the general objections you have raised to our production\nrequests.\nBoilerplate Objections\nA boilerplate objection such as \"overbroad, burdensome, and not reasonably calculated\nto lead to the discovery of admissible evidence,\" baldly asserted, is \"patently without\nmerit.\" Such \"stonewalling tactics\" constitute discovery abuse. First Healthcare Corp.\nv. Hamilton, 740 So.2d 1189, 1193 (Fla. 4th DCA 1999); see also First City Devs. Of\nFla., Inc. v. Hallmark of Holly Condo. Ass in, 545 So.2d 502, 503 (Fla. 41h DCA 1985)\n(noting that conclusory objections such as \"burdensome\" and \"not reasonably calculated\n...\" are \"words of the art [that] have little meaning without substantive support, ..\").\nEvery burdensome objection you have raised is required to be supported by an affidavit\ndetailing the extent of the burden claimed to preclude a substantive response.\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 31 of\n34\nThomas E. Scott, Jr., Esq.\nRe: Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz\nFebruary 25, 2015\nPage 3\nAsserting Privilege for Non-Existent Documents\nIt is inappropriate to assert a claim of privilege or immunity for non-existent materials.\nGreenleaf v. Amerada Hess Corp., 626 So.2d 263, 264 n.1 (Fla. 4th DCA 1993). We\nmust assume that the privilege is asserted for a reason, i.e., that responsive and\nostensibly privileged information in fact exists, else the privilege would not have been\nasserted. It follows that a privilege log must accompany all such responses.\nClaiming Undue Burden for Non-Existent Materials\nLikewise, objecting on basis of burdensomeness and later conceding an opponent's right\nto materials or later claiming materials do not exist constitute abusive discovery\npractices. First Healthcare Corp. v. Hamilton, 740 So.2d 1189, 1194 (Fla. 4th DCA\n1999).\nCustody, Possession & Control\nFla. R. Civ. P. reaches all documents (broadly defined and specifically including\nelectronic data) in your client's \"custody, possession, or control.\" Custody and\npossession are self-explanatory. \"Control\" is broader; it \"means the legal right to obtain,\neven from nonparties. The concept of 'control' generally has been held to mean the legal\nright to obtain the requested documents. Parties thus can be requested to produce\ndocuments in the hands of their attorney, insurer, subsidiary, or another person outside\nthe jurisdiction of the court.\" Lawrence M. Watson, Jr. & Michael S. Orfinger, Fla.\nCivil Practice Before Trial , 16.60 (1993 ed) (citing 8 Wright & Miller, Fed. Practice\n& Procedure £16-10 (1998 ed.). A recent federal court case construing Fed. R. Civ. P.\n41 (on which Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.350 is patterned), explained:\nThe term \"control\" comprehends not only possession but also the right,\nauthority, or ability to obtain the documents. Accordingly, Rule 34(a)\nallows a party seeking discovery to require production of documents\nbeyond the actual possession of the opposing party if such party has\nretained \"any right or ability to influence the person in whose possession\nthe documents lie.\" [A] party is deemed to have control over documents\nheld on its behalf by its attorneys. A party is also deemed to have control\nover financial records of the party that are in the possession of the party's\naccountant.\nMGP Ingredients, Inc. v. Mars, Inc., 2007 WL 3353401 (D. Kan. 2007) (citation\nomitted); see also In Re Ski Train Fire of November 11, 2000 Kaprun Austria, 2006\nsiSistas,\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 32 of\n34\nThomas E. Scott, Jr., Esq.\nRe: Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz\nFebruary 25, 2015\nPage 4\nWL 1328259, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (\"Courts have long construed the term 'control' as\nmeaning more than simple 'possession.' Control has been construed broadly by the\ncourts as the legal right, authority, or practical ability to obtain the materials sought\nupon demand.'\"). See also Frantz v. Golebiewski, 407 So.2d 283, 285 n.4 (Fla. 3 DCA\n1981) (\"Interpretations of the federal rule are persuasive in considering its Florida\nequivalent.\").\nWhile your responses purport to recognize the obligation to produce documents subject\nto Mr. Dershowitz's \"contra', there are qualifications in the responses that would\nappear to contradict that recognition. Your objection to the production of metadata has\nno legal foundation.\nWord Play and Gamesmanship\nYou will note that we do not include page after page of definitions. I believe that any\nlawyer reasonably fluent in English can carry out his or her duty to construe\ninterrogatories and requests for production in the broad and liberal manner intended by\nthe rules. Florida courts frown on parsing and gamesmanship. See, e.g. First Healthcare\nCorp. v. Hamilton, 740 So.2d 1189, 1194 (Fla. 4th DCA 1999) (chastising counsel who\ndid not turn over \"event\" reports because plaintiff requested \"incident\" reports as\nengaged in \"little more than a semantic shell game.\").\nRepeated assertions that statements were made by Mr. Dershowitz \"upon information\nand belief' is an example of prohibited \"word play.\" That qualification has no bearing\non the Defendant's discovery obligations.\n\"Will Produce\"\nThe Rules of Civil Procedure require production and not just a commitment of\nproduction at some unspecified future date. If the documents you intend to produce are\navailable for inspection and copying now as they are required to be, we are prepared to\npick them up immediately. If they are not immediately available, when will they be?\nTimeframe Objections\nYour repeated attempts to restrict discovery to a narrow timeframe, fail to account for\nthe fact that this is a defamation action arising out of broad defamatory statements made\nby Mr. Dershowitz impugning the honesty and integrity of the Plaintiffs without any\nlimitations as to a specific time or circumstance. Mr. Dershowitz has also made broad\npublic denials of misconduct unrestricted to any specific timeframe. We are entitled to\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 33 of\n34\nThomas E. Scott, Jr., Esq.\nRe: Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz\nFebruary 25, 2015\nPage 5\ntest the accuracy of those statements and to explore the full extent of the personal\nrelationship he has had with Jeffrey Epstein.\nEvasive Answers\nThe response to Interrogatory #2 is a typical example of an evasive response. Rather\nthan address the substance of the questions posed, the Defendant engages in a four page\ndiatribe about the alleged impropriety of naming him in a CVRA filing on behalf of\nJane Doe #3. If that is the only improper conduct in which the Defendant contends\nBradley Edwards has engaged, then the Defendant is obliged to say so.\nInterrogatory #3 asks for the specific content of statements and the names of every\nwitness to the making of the statements. We get a vague reference to \"such comments\"\nand references to the inability to \"recall all of the people.\" Not a single witness' name\nis disclosed. If the Defendant is unable to identify a single person he is obliged to\nunequivocally say so.\nRefusing to Provide Substantive Responses Until Jane Doe #3 is Deposed\nThis objection has absolutely no legal basis and fails to recognize that this is a\ndefamation action against Dershowitz and not Mr. Dershowitz's defamation action\nagainst Jane Doe #3. This action is absolutely not dependent on the accuracy of the\nstatements made by Jane Doe #3, although the Plaintiffs were and are confident of the\naccuracy of those statements.\nObjecting Because You Think We Already Know the Answers\nSee for example the Response to Interrogatory #13. There is no legal basis for refusing\nto provide information because the Defendant believes the Plaintiff already knows the\nanswer or has alternative sources to ascertain some or all of the information requested.\nAn admission from an opposing party carries legal significance that other evidence does\nnot have. We are entitled to Dershowitz's sworn responses regardless of what flight\nlogs purport to show.\nIncomplete Answers\nSee, for example, Interrogatory #15. A question that asks for names, addresses, and\ntelephone numbers, is not properly responded to if all we get is, \"Thomas and Joanne\nAshe, as well as Defendant's wife and daughter.\"\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 34 of\n34\nThomas E.

If they were\nunder the new Code, they would not be before the Board today and may not have\na fine at all. He realizes a mistake was made, he realizes something has to be paid\nbut he thinks $35,000 is a significant fine. The Board has gotten their attention\nand they would ask for a significant reduction in the fine.\n\nMr. Fried asked how long it took to get the final inspection after the 22 months\nhad run. Mr. Walton said they had been given 23 months due to the hurricanes\nand they were 5 months and 9 days beyond that. Mr. Ballentine asked how far out\nthey would be under the new rules. Mr. Walton said they would be given 24\nmonths which with the hurricane would be 25 months. Mr. Lynch said that at the\nend of that 24 month period, if they had not sought an extension of time within the\nrequired time period, no earlier than 6 months and no later than 45 days, before the\nexpiration of that 24 months, their project would have been shut down. Mr.\nWagner’s lack of knowledge of this particular situation would have become\nirrelevant because they would have been red tagged on the next day after the 24\nmonth period. Mr. Lynch said Mr. Wagner did not know because he has been a\ngood corporate citizen and had never been before the Board except on one\noccasion which was beyond his control; it was a maintenance item on the Glazer\nhouse. Mr. Walton said that situation was not due to Mr. Wagner’s fault, that he\nwas just representing the owner.\n\nMr. Ballentine asked how Mr. Wagner did not know the Code requirement if he\nhad built so many homes in the area and said he had difficulty with the ignorance\nof that.\n\nMr. Fried said he agreed with Mr. Ballentine and found it hard to believe that Mr.\nWagner did not know the time limits. He said some reduction should be considered\nbut he was not sure on what basis.\n\nMr. Ochstein remarked that the fine was around $35,000 and the house was on the\nmarket for $10.6 million dollars so he did not see the hardship. Mr. Lynch said he\ndid not know the price but he would accept Mr. Ochstein’s statement on that. Mr.\nLynch said the hardship was in the imposition of the fine itself, there were mistakes\nmade and he believed that Council would have given them a significant extension\nof time if Mr. Wagner had been aware of the situation and filed the proper notice\nwith Town Council.\n\nMr. Lynch said if some sort of arrangement could be reached today, his client\nwould be in a position to pay within the next two weeks. Mr. Hoffman said he\nwas concerned because he believed that when the case was originally heard, they\nhad the option of fining $250.00 a day and they gave them a fine reduction at the\ntime they initiated the fine of $125.00 a day. Mr. Walton corrected Mr. Hoffman,\nadvising there was a motion for a fine of $125.00 a day which failed and the fine\nthat was in effect was $250.00 a day.

We also feel that symbolism is critical to the notion of AGI\ndevelopment — and even more broadly, to the systems theory of development in general.\n\nAs a broad conceptual perspective on development, we suggest that one may view the de-\nvelopment of a complex information processing system, embedded in an environment, in terms\nof the stages:\n\ne automatic: the system interacts with the environment by “instinct”, according to its innate\nprogramming\n\ne adaptive: the system internally adapts to the environment, then interacting with the en-\nvironment in a more appropriate way\n\ne symbolic: the system creates internal symbolic representations of itself and the environ-\nment, which in the case of a complex, appropriately structured environment, allows it to\ninteract with the environment more intelligently\n\ne reflexive: the system creates internal symbolic representations of its own internal symbolic\nrepresentations, thus achieving an even higher degree of intelligence\n\nSketched so broadly, these are not precisely defined categories but rather heuristic, intuitive\ncategories. Formalizing them would be possible but would lead us too far astray here.\n\nOne can interpret these stages in a variety of different contexts. Here our focus is the cognitive\ndevelopment of humans and human-like AGI systems, but in Table 11.1 we present them in\na slightly more general context, using two examples: the Piagetan example of the human (or\nhumanlike) mind as it develops from infancy to maturity; and also the example of the “origin\nof life’ and the development of life from proto-life up into its modern form. In any event, we\nallude to this more general perspective on development here mainly to indicate our view that\nthe Piagetan perspective is not something ad hoc and arbitrary, but rather can plausibly be seen\nas a specific manifestation of more fundamental principles of complex systems development.\n\n11.3 Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development\n\nThe ghost of Jean Piaget hangs over modern developmental psychology in a yet unresolved\nway. Piaget’s theories provide a cogent overarching perspective on human cognitive develop-\nment, coordinating broad theoretical ideas and diverse experimental results into a unified whole\n[Pia55]. Modern experimental work has shown Piaget’s ideas to be often oversimplified and in-\ncorrect. However, what has replaced the Piagetan understanding is not an alternative unified\nand coherent theory, but a variety of microtheories addressing particular aspects of cognitive\ndevelopment. For this reason a number of contemporary theorists taking a computer science\n[Shu03] or dynamical systems [Wit07| approach to developmental psychology have chosen to\nadopt the Piagetan framework in spite of its demonstrated shortcomings, both because of its\nconceptual strengths and for lack of a coherent, more rigorously grounded alternative.\n\nOur own position is that the Piagetan view of development has some fundamental truth to it,\nwhich is reflected via how nicely it fits with a broader view of development in complex systems.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013104\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

These co-conveners\nhave also been assisted, financially and logistically, by The Annenberg Foundation Trust\nat Sunnylands. We are grateful to each of these institutions for their support of our work,\nand to Thomas Gilligan, Director of the Hoover Institution, and Ambassador David Lane,\nPresident of The Annenberg Foundation Trust at Sunnylands, for their personal support\nof this project. We also thank the latter two institutions, as well as the China Policy\nProgram of the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University, for\nsupporting and hosting meetings of the Working Group.\nThis report has been a collaborative effort among a group of American scholars and policy\npractitioners who have spent long careers studying and engaging China, Asia more broadly,\nand a wide variety of political systems around the world. Each participant also has an\nabiding interest in protecting and strengthening democratic institutions in the United\nStates and elsewhere in the world. While different participants took the lead in drafting\nparticular sections of the report, each section was reviewed and contributed to by a number\nof participants in what became a truly collective and collaborative research effort. Our\ngeneral findings and policy principles represent a broad—though not necessarily complete—\nconsensus of the Working Group Participants.\nThis Working Group grew out of the Task Force on US-China Relations (chaired by Susan\nShirk and Orville Schell), and we thank the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the\nHenry Luce Foundation for their support of the Task Force. Although the two efforts share\nmany members in common, they are separate and distinct endeavors.\nWe present this report as the collective product of discussions and research among a group\nof distinguished American specialists on China and US foreign affairs. It analyzes the\ngrowing challenge posed by China’s influence-seeking activities in the United States across\na number of important sectors of American public life. However, as we note throughout the\nreport, these influence activities are not confined to the US. Indeed, they appear in different\nforms and to different degrees in a large number of other democratic societies around the\nworld (in some cases more deeply than in the US). We therefore have opted to include in an\nAppendix short summary reports on China’s influence activities (and the resulting national\nresponses) in eight other countries.\nWe owe a particular debt of thanks to Kyle Hutzler, an MBA student at Stanford University\nwith significant experience in China.

To this end, and in light of growing evidence of China’s interference\nin various sectors of American government and society, we propose three broad principles\nthat should serve as the basis for protecting the integrity of American institutions inside the\nUnited States while also protecting basic core American values, norms, and laws.\nTransparency\nTransparency is a fundamental tenet and asset of democracy, and the best protection against\nthe manipulation of American entities by outside actors.\n• American NGOs should play an important role in investigating and monitoring\nillicit activities by China and other foreign actors. They should as well seek to inform\nthemselves about the full range of Chinese influence activities and the distinctions\nbetween legitimate and illegitimate influence efforts.\n• Congress should perform its constitutional role by continuing to investigate, report\non, and recommend appropriate action concerning Chinese influence activities in\nthe United States. It should update relevant laws and regulations regarding foreign\ninfluence, and adopt new ones, to strengthen transparency in foreign efforts to\nexert influence.\n• Executive branch agencies should similarly investigate and publicize, when\nappropriate, findings concerning these activities, with a view to promoting healthy\nand responsible vigilance among American governmental and nongovernmental\nactors.\n• The US media should undertake careful, fact-based investigative reporting of Chinese\ninfluence activities, and it should enhance its knowledge base for undertaking\nresponsible reporting.\n• Faculty governance is the key to preserving academic freedom in American\nuniversities. All gifts, grants, endowments, and cooperative programs, including\nx\nConfucius Institutes, should be subjected to the usual procedures of faculty\noversight.\n• US governmental and nongovernmental sectors should disclose financial and other\nrelationships that may be subject to foreign influence.\nIntegrity\nForeign funding can undermine the independence of American institutions, and various\ntypes of coercive and covert activities by China (and other countries) directly contradict\ncore democratic values and freedoms, which must be protected by institutional vigilance\nand effective governance.\n• Openness and freedom are fundamental elements of American democracy and\nintrinsic strengths of the United States and its way of life. These values must be\nprotected against corrosive actions by China and other countries.\n• Various institutions—but notably universities and think tanks—need to\nenhance sharing and pooling of information concerning Chinese activities,\nand they should promote more closely coordinated collective action to counter\nChina’s inappropriate activities and pressures. This report recommends that\nAmerican institutions within each of the above two sectors (and possibly others)\nformulate and agree to a “Code of Conduct” to guide their exchanges with Chinese\ncounterparts.\n• When they believe that efforts to exert influence have violated US laws or\nthe rights of American citizens and foreign residents in the United States, US\ninstitutions should refer such activities to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.\n• Rigorous efforts should be undertaken to inform the Chinese American community\nabout potentially inappropriate activities carried out by China. At the same time,\nutmost efforts must be taken to protect the rights of the Chinese American\ncommunity, as well as protecting the rights of Chinese citizens living or studying in\nthe United States.\n• Consideration should be given to establishing a federal government office that\nAmerican state and local governments and nongovernmental institutions could\napproach—on a strictly voluntary basis—for advice on how best to manage Chinese\nrequests for engagement and partnership. This office could also provide confidential\nbackground on the affiliations of Chinese individuals and organizations to party and\nstate institutions.\nPolicy Principles for Constructive Vigilance\nxi\n• All American institutions—governmental and nongovernmental—that deal with\nChinese actors (and other potential sources of inappropriate foreign influence) should\nreview their oversight and governance practices and codify and exemplify best\nstandards of practice and due diligence.\nReciprocity\nAmerican institutions are deflected from their purpose of increasing US-China\nunderstanding, and become distorted as one-way channels of Chinese influence, when they\nare denied access to China on a basis that is reciprocal with the access Chinese institutions\nare granted here.\n• The asymmetry of scholarly research access is the most glaring example of the lack of\nreciprocity. A whole variety of normal scholarly activities—including access to archives\nand certain libraries, fieldwork, conducting surveys, and interviewing officials or\naverage citizens—have been cut off for American researchers in China while Chinese\nenjoy all of these academic opportunities in the United States. Individually and\ncollectively, universities and other sectors of American democratic life should insist on\ngreater reciprocity of access.\n• US government public diplomacy activities are heavily circumscribed in China,\nwhile nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have encountered an increasingly\ndifficult environment to carry out their work. More reasonable reciprocity for US\npublic diplomacy efforts in China, relative to China’s activities in the United States,\nshould be addressed in negotiations between the two countries. In addition, this\nreport recommends enhanced American efforts to promote independent news and\ninformation, and democratic ideas, through US global broadcasting and efforts to\ncounter disinformation.\n• The US government should actively promote and protect opportunities for American\nactors to operate in China.\nPolicy Principles for Constructive Vigilance\nxii\nPolicy Principles for Constructive Vigilance\nIntroduction\nFor three and a half decades following the end of the Maoist era, China adhered to\nDeng Xiaoping’s policies of “reform and opening to the outside world” and “peaceful\ndevelopment.” After Deng retired as paramount leader, these principles continued to\nguide China’s international behavior in the leadership eras of Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao.\nAdmonishing Chinese to “keep your heads down and bide your time,” these Party leaders\nsought to emphasize that China’s rapid economic development and its accession to “great\npower” status need not be threatening to either the existing global order or the interests\nof its Asian neighbors. However, since Party general secretary Xi Jinping came to power in\n2012, the situation has changed. Under his leadership, China has significantly expanded\nthe more assertive set of policies initiated by his predecessor Hu Jintao. These policies not\nonly seek to redefine China’s place in the world as a global player, but they also have put\nforward the notion of a “China option” ( 中国方案 ) that is claimed to be a more efficient\ndevelopmental model than liberal democracy.\nWhile Americans are well acquainted with China’s quest for influence through the projection\nof diplomatic, economic, and military power, we are less aware of the myriad ways Beijing\nhas more recently been seeking cultural and informational influence, some of which could\nundermine our democratic processes. These include efforts to penetrate and sway—through\nvarious methods that former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull summarized as\n“covert, coercive or corrupting”—a range of groups and institutions, including the Chinese\nAmerican community, Chinese students in the United States, and American civil society\norganizations, academic institutions, think tanks, and media. 1\nSome of these efforts fall into the category of normal public diplomacy as pursued by many\nother countries. But others involve the use of coercive or corrupting methods to pressure\nindividuals and groups and thereby interfere in the functioning of American civil and\npolitical life.\nIt is important not to exaggerate the threat of these new Chinese initiatives. China has not\nsought to interfere in a national election in the United States or to sow confusion or inflame\npolarization in our democratic discourse the way Russia has done. For all the tensions in the\nrelationship, there are deep historical bonds of friendship, cultural exchange, and mutual\ninspiration between the two societies, which we celebrate and wish to nurture. And it is\nimperative that Chinese Americans—who feel the same pride in American citizenship as do\nother American ethnic communities—not be subjected to the kind of generalized suspicion\nor stigmatization that could lead to racial profiling or a new era of McCarthyism. However,\n2\nwith increased challenges in the diplomatic, economic, and security domains, China’s\ninfluence activities have collectively helped throw the crucial relationship between the\nPeople’s Republic of China and the United States into a worrisome state of imbalance and\nantagonism. (Throughout the report, “China” refers to the Chinese Communist Party and the\ngovernment apparatus of the People’s Republic of China, and not to Chinese society at large\nor the Chinese people as a whole.) Not only are the values of China’s authoritarian system\nanathema to those held by most Americans, but there is also a growing body of evidence\nthat the Chinese Communist Party views the American ideals of freedom of speech, press,\nassembly, religion, and association as direct challenges to its defense of its own form of oneparty\nrule. 2\nBoth the US and China have derived substantial benefit as the two nations have become\nmore economically and socially intertwined. The value of combined US-China trade\n($635.4 billion, with a $335.4 US deficit) far surpasses that between any other pair of\ncountries. 3 More than 350,000 Chinese students currently study in US universities (plus\n80,000 more in secondary schools). Moreover, millions of Chinese have immigrated to\nthe United States seeking to build their lives with more economic, religious, and political\nfreedom, and their presence has been an enormous asset to American life.\nHowever, these virtues cannot eclipse the reality that in certain key ways China is\nexploiting America’s openness in order to advance its aims on a competitive playing field\nthat is hardly level. For at the same time that China’s authoritarian system takes advantage\nof the openness of American society to seek influence, it impedes legitimate efforts by\nAmerican counterpart institutions to engage Chinese society on a reciprocal basis. This\ndisparity lies at the heart of this project’s concerns.\nChina’s influence activities have moved beyond their traditional United Front focus\non diaspora communities to target a far broader range of sectors in Western societies,\nranging from think tanks, universities, and media to state, local, and national government\ninstitutions. China seeks to promote views sympathetic to the Chinese Government,\npolicies, society, and culture; suppress alternative views; and co-opt key American players to\nsupport China’s foreign policy goals and economic interests.\nNormal public diplomacy, such as visitor programs, cultural and educational exchanges,\npaid media inserts, and government lobbying are accepted methods used by many\ngovernments to project soft power. They are legitimate in large measure because they are\ntransparent. But this report details a range of more assertive and opaque “sharp power”\nactivities that China has stepped up within the United States in an increasingly active\nmanner. 4 These exploit the openness of our democratic society to challenge, and sometimes\neven undermine, core American freedoms, norms, and laws.\nIntroduction\n3\nExcept for Russia, no other country’s efforts to influence American politics and society\nis as extensive and well-funded as China’s. The ambition of Chinese activity in terms of\nthe breadth, depth of investment of financial resources, and intensity requires far greater\nscrutiny than it has been getting, because China is intervening more resourcefully and\nforcefully across a wider range of sectors than Russia. By undertaking activities that have\nbecome more organically embedded in the pluralistic fabric of American life, it has gained a\nfar wider and potentially longer-term impact.\nSummary of Findings\nThis report, written and endorsed by a group of this country’s leading China specialists and\nstudents of one-party systems is the result of more than a year of research and represents\nan attempt to document the extent of China’s expanding influence operations inside the\nUnited States. While there have been many excellent reports documenting specific examples\nof Chinese influence seeking, 5 this effort attempts to come to grips with the issue as a whole\nand features an overview of the Chinese party-state United Front apparatus responsible for\nguiding overseas influence activities. It also includes individual sections on different sectors\nof American society that have been targeted by China. The appendices survey China’s quite\ndiverse influence activities in other democratic countries around the world.\nAmong the report’s findings:\n• The Chinese Communist party-state leverages a broad range of party, state, and non-state\nactors to advance its influence-seeking objectives, and in recent years it has significantly\naccelerated both its investment and the intensity of these efforts. While many of the\nactivities described in this report are state-directed, there is no single institution in China’s\nparty-state that is wholly responsible, even though the “United Front Work Department”\nhas become a synecdoche for China’s influence activities, and the State Council\nInformation Office and CCP 6 Central Committee Foreign Affairs Commission have\noversight responsibilities (see Appendix: “China’s Influence Operations Bureaucracy”).\nBecause of the pervasiveness of the party-state, many nominally independent actors—\nincluding Chinese civil society, academia, corporations, and even religious institutions—\nare also ultimately beholden to the government and are frequently pressured into service\nto advance state interests. The main agencies responsible for foreign influence operations\ninclude the Party’s United Front Work Department, the Central Propaganda Department,\nthe International Liaison Department, the State Council Information Office, the All-China\nFederation of Overseas Chinese, and the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with\nForeign Countries. These organizations and others are bolstered by various state agencies\nsuch as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the\nState Council, which in March 2018 was merged into the United Front Work Department,\nreflecting that department’s increasing power.\nIntroduction\n4\n• In American federal and state politics, China seeks to identify and cultivate rising\npoliticians. Like many other countries, Chinese entities employ prominent lobbying\nand public relations firms and cooperate with influential civil society groups. These\nactivities complement China’s long-standing support of visits to China by members\nof Congress and their staffs. In some rare instances China has used private citizens\nand/or companies to exploit loopholes in US regulations that prohibit direct foreign\ncontributions to elections.\n• On university campuses, Confucius Institutes (CIs) provide the Chinese government\naccess to US student bodies. Because CIs have had positive value in exposing students\nand communities to Chinese language and culture, the report does not generally oppose\nthem. But it does recommend that more rigorous university oversight and standards\nof academic freedom and transparency be exercised over CIs. With the direct support\nof the Chinese embassy and consulates, Chinese Students and Scholars Associations\n(CSSAs) sometimes report on and compromise the academic freedom of other Chinese\nstudents and American faculty on American campuses. American universities that host\nevents deemed politically offensive by the Chinese Communist Party and government\nhave been subject to increasing pressure, and sometimes even to retaliation, by\ndiplomats in the Chinese embassy and its six consulates as well as by CSSA branches.\nAlthough the United States is open to Chinese scholars studying American politics or\nhistory, China restricts access to American scholars and researchers seeking to study\npolitically sensitive areas of China’s political system, society, and history in country.\n• At think tanks, researchers, scholars, and other staffers report regular attempts by\nChinese diplomats and other intermediaries to influence their activities within the\nUnited States. At the same time that China has begun to establish its own network\nof think tanks in the United States, it has been constraining the number and scale of\nAmerican think tanks operations in China. It also restricts the access to China and to\nChinese officials of American think-tank researchers and delegations.\n• In business, China often uses its companies to advance strategic objectives abroad,\ngaining political influence and access to critical infrastructure and technology. China\nhas made foreign companies’ continued access to its domestic market conditional on\ntheir compliance with Beijing’s stance on Taiwan and Tibet. This report documents\nhow China has supported the formation of dozens of local Chinese chambers of\ncommerce in the United States that appear to have ties to the Chinese government.\n• In the American media, China has all but eliminated the plethora of independent\nChinese-language media outlets that once served Chinese American communities. It\nhas co-opted existing Chinese-language outlets and established its own new outlets.\nState-owned Chinese media companies have also established a significant foothold\nIntroduction\n5\nin the English-language market, in print, radio, television, and online. At the same\ntime, the Chinese government has severely limited the ability of US and other Western\nmedia outlets to conduct normal news gathering activities within China, much less\nto provide news feeds directly to Chinese listeners, viewers, and readers in China, by\nlimiting and blocking their Chinese-language websites and forbidding distribution of\ntheir output within China itself.\n• Among the Chinese American community, China has long sought to influence—\neven silence—voices critical of the PRC or supportive of Taiwan by dispatching\npersonnel to the United States to pressure these individuals and while also pressuring\ntheir relatives in China. Beijing also views Chinese Americans as members of a\nworldwide Chinese diaspora that presumes them to retain not only an interest in the\nwelfare of China but also a loosely defined cultural, and even political, allegiance to\nthe so-called Motherland. Such activities not only interfere with freedom of speech\nwithin the United States but they also risk generating suspicion of Chinese Americans\neven though those who accept Beijing’s directives are a very small minority.\n• In the technology sector, China is engaged in a multifaceted effort to misappropriate\ntechnologies it deems critical to its economic and military success. Beyond economic\nespionage, theft, and the forced technology transfers that are required of many joint\nventure partnerships, China also captures much valuable new technology through its\ninvestments in US high-tech companies and through its exploitation of the openness\nof American university labs. This goes well beyond influence-seeking to a deeper\nand more disabling form of penetration. The economic and strategic losses for the\nUnited States are increasingly unsustainable, threatening not only to help China gain\nglobal dominance of a number of the leading technologies of the future, but also to\nundermine America’s commercial and military advantages.\n• Around the world, China’s influence-seeking activities in the United States are\nmirrored in different forms in many other countries. To give readers a sense of\nthe variation in China’s influence-seeking efforts abroad, this report also includes\nsummaries of the experiences of eight other countries, including Australia, Canada,\nFrance, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and the UK.\nToward Constructive Vigilance\nIn weighing policy responses to influence seeking in a wide variety of American\ninstitutions, the Working Group has sought to strike a balance between passivity and\noverreaction, confidence in our foundations and alarm about their possible subversion,\nand the imperative to sustain openness while addressing the unfairness of contending\non a series of uneven playing fields. Achieving this balance requires that we differentiate\nconstructive from harmful forms of interaction and carefully gauge the challenge, lest we\nIntroduction\n6\nsee threats everywhere and overreact in ways that both undermine our own principles and\nunnecessarily damage the US-China relationship.\nThe sections that follow lodge recommendations under three broad headings. The first\ntwo, promoting “transparency” and “integrity,” are hardly controversial in the face of the\nexisting challenge, and they elicited little debate. Sunshine is the best disinfectant against\nany manipulation of American entities by outside actors and we should shine as much light\nas possible on Chinese influence seeking over organizations and individuals if it is covert,\ncoercive, or corrupting. We should also shore up the vitality of our institutions and our own\nsolidarity against Chinese divide-and-conquer tactics. Defending the integrity of American\ndemocratic institutions requires standing up for our principles of openness and freedom,\nmore closely coordinating responses within institutional sectors, and also better informing\nboth governmental and nongovernmental actors about the potentially harmful influence\nactivities of China and other foreign actors.\nIt was in the third category, promoting “reciprocity,” where the Working Group confronted\nthe most difficult choices. In a wide range of fields, the Chinese government severely\nrestricts American platforms and access while Chinese counterparts are given free rein in\nour society. Can this playing field be leveled and greater reciprocity be attained without\nlowering our own standards of openness and fairness? Since complaints and demarches by\nthe US government and private institutions have not produced adequate results, is it possible\nto get Chinese attention by imposing reciprocal restrictions that do not undermine our own\nprinciples of openness?\nThe Working Group, not always in unanimity, settled on a selective approach. We believe\nthat in certain areas the only practical leverage resides in tit-for-tat retaliation. This\nwould not be an end in itself, but a means to compel a greater reciprocity. The Chinese\ngovernment respects firmness, fairness summons it, and American opinion compels it.\nEach section of this report offers its own recommendations for responding to China’s\ninfluence seeking activities in ways that will enhance the transparency of relationships,\ndefend the integrity of American democratic institutions, and grant American individuals\nand institutions greater access in China that equates with the degree of access afforded\nChinese counterparts in the United States.\nOur recommendations urge responses to China’s challenge that will promote greater\ntransparency, integrity, and reciprocity. We believe that a new emphasis on such\n“constructive vigilance” is the best way to begin to protect our democratic traditions,\ninstitutions, and nation, and to create a fairer and more reciprocal relationship that will be\nthe best guarantor of healthier ties between the United States and China.\nIntroduction\n7\nNOTES\n1 Malcolm Turnbull, “Speech Introducing the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and\nForeign Interference) Bill 2017,” December 7, 2017, https://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/speechintroducing-the-national-security-legislation-amendment-espionage-an.\n2 See CCP Central Committee Document No. 9: http://www.chinafile.com/document-9-chinafile-translation.\n3 https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/china-mongolia-taiwan/peoples-republic-china.\n4 National Endowment for Democracy, Sharp Power: Rising Authoritarian Influence, Washington, DC,\nDecember 2017, https://www.ned.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Sharp-Power-Rising-Authoritarian-\nInfluence-Full-Report.pdf.\n5 Several other studies have recently been published concerning China’s influence activities and united\nfront work abroad, including: Bowe, Alexander. “China’s Overseas United Front Work.” US-China Economic\nand Security Review Commission.

It is\nsometimes also referred to as the Communist Party of China (CPC).\nIntroduction\n8\nIntroduction\nSECTION 1\nCongress\nDuring past presidential administrations, the US Congress has generally served as a brake\non executive initiatives to “engage” China at the expense of other US interests that\nmembers have historically valued, such as maintaining good relations with Taiwan,\ninteracting with the Tibetan government in exile, and expressing support for human\nrights. When President Donald Trump assumed office in 2017 and actively began courting\nChinese President Xi Jinping, first at Mar-a-Lago and then at the Beijing summit, Congress\ntook a wait-and-see posture. But as his own ardor for a partnership with Xi cooled and his\nadministration became disenchanted with the idea of finding an easy new “engagement”\npolicy, momentum began to shift. Soon Congress was working toward one of the most\nsignificant reevaluations of American-China policy since the start of normalization fifty\nyears ago. And with the White House increasingly skeptical about the prospects of winning\nPresident Xi ‘s cooperation, a series of new initiatives began issuing forth from both the\nadministration and the Congress, suggesting a rapidly changing landscape for US-China\nrelations. What was telling was that this tidal shift now emanated not from Congress\nalone—where it had strong bipartisan support—but from the White House and National\nSecurity Council, the Pentagon, the Office of the US Trade Representative, the Department\nof the Treasury, and even the Department of State. As sentiment shifted away from hopes of\nfinding common ways to collaborate, a spate of new US policy initiatives began appearing\nthat suggested a sea change. Congress passed the 2019 National Defense Authorization\nAct, which sought to bolster US defenses against both Chinese military threats and\nChina’s influence-seeking operations inside the United States. Congress also passed the\nForeign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRMMA), which empowered\nCFIUS (the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) to expand its oversight\nof foreign direct investment (FDI) from China. At the same time, members of Congress also\nbegan expressing ever more strenuous opposition to Chinese nonreciprocal practices in\ntrade and investment, such as: putting whole sectors of the Chinese economy out-of-bounds\nto American investors; using Chinese companies to buy into sensitive high-tech areas of\nthe US economy through mergers and acquisitions; and making the transfer of American\nadvanced technology to Chinese partners the price of American companies being given\naccess to Chinese markets. Congressional concern rose over Beijing’s continued expansion\ninto and militarization of the South China Sea; the predatory lending practices that can be\ninvolved in President Xi Jinping’s signature Belt and Road Initiative; and Beijing’s continued\npersecution of Taiwan and opposition to US support for the island.\nThis section reviews highlights of Chinese government’s efforts to influence the US Congress\nsince the start of the normalization process in 1972. As suggested above, because it has\n10\nviewed such “engagement” as too often taking place at the expense of more important\ninterests, the Congress has usually been more wary than the White House of allowing hopes\nfor a more positive US-China relations to determine our policy. At times, such as during\nthe passage of the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979 and in reaction to the Chinese crackdown\naround Tiananmen Square in 1989, Congress has actively resisted the White House and\nsought to turn American policy in directions both the Chinese leadership and the US\nadministration have opposed. However, often Congress has played a somewhat passive role,\nespecially in recent years. Still, the control it formally exercises over US government budget\noutlays, legislation, and the approval of appointments of senior administration officials\nmakes Congress not only important in the formation of US-China policy but also a prime\ntarget for Chinese influence efforts.\nBy providing historical background, the review that follows informs contemporary US\nconcerns about Chinese government efforts to influence American leaders and public\nopinion. The record over the past four decades shows some success in Chinese efforts to\nwin influence over congressional opinion. However, more often than not, whatever positive\nresults they have won have not lasted in the face of enduring differences between the two\ncountries.\nCongressional Visits to China, 1972–1977\nPresident Nixon’s second term featured the Watergate scandal, which forced his resignation\nin 1974 and resulted in a lull in high-level communication with China. This circumstance\ngave more prominence to the reports issued by the approximately eighty members of\nCongress who traveled to China in the period between President Nixon’s visit in 1972\nand the start of the Carter administration in January 1977. The visits of these congressional\ndelegations—including (repeatedly) top leaders from both parties—were by far the most\nactive channel of high-level communications between the United States and the PRC during\nthis time. And most of the members who went to China wrote reports that were published\nas official documents. At the time, these congressional reports, as well as the media’s\ncoverage of their visits, became important vehicles through which American congressional\nleaders voiced their views and opinions on domestic Chinese politics and on Sino-American\nrelations, both of which were having an increasingly important impact on American\ninterests in Asia and the world.\nBy and large, these American visitors were pleased by the post-1972 developments in\nUS-China relations, seeing them as likely to be both a source of strategic leverage against\nthe Soviet Union and a stabilizing influence in Asian affairs. The government in Beijing\nwas seen as preoccupied with domestic affairs, no longer opposed to the presence of\nAmerican forces in East Asia, and anxious to work with the United States and other\nnoncommunist countries to offset Soviet pressure against China. The Americans saw the\nTaiwan question as the main impediment to improved bilateral relations, but they differed\nCongress\n11\non how the United States should deal with the problem. Although most members of\nCongress accepted the Ford administration’s cautious approach to China as wise, many were\ncircumspect about the merits of China’s political, economic, social, and value systems, then\nexperiencing the last turmoil of the Cultural Revolution and the decline and death of Mao\nZedong in 1976.\nThese congressional visits to China seemed to help the Chinese government improve its\nstanding with Congress and favorably influence American public opinion. The resulting\nreports show how granting these delegations access to China’s leaders and elements of\nChinese society that Beijing wished to highlight proved an effective strategy of calming\ntensions. And the costs for Beijing were limited to modest in-country expenses, since\nthe members usually traveled as official congressional delegations on US government\naircraft.\nOne notable feature of this historical episode was the remarkable role played by Senate\nMajority Leader Mike Mansfield (D-MT). Senator Mansfield was widely consulted in\nWashington as an Asian affairs expert, meaning his observations arguably had more\ninfluence than those of other members. He visited China three times during this period,\npublishing separate reports with detailed assessments of various issues of concern to\nAmericans at the time. In the main, his reports conveyed information and opinions that\nconformed with Chinese interests. Unlike many other members favoring a more cautious\npace of normalization with China and sustained ties with Taiwan, Senator Mansfield urged\nthe United States to promptly end ties with Taiwan and accept Beijing’s conditions for\nnormal diplomatic relations, warning that to do otherwise would lead to dangerous friction\nin Sino-American relations and instability in Asia. Senator Mansfield portrayed China as a\npower with fundamentally peaceful motives in international affairs and placed much of the\nblame on the United States for past Sino-American conflicts in Asia. He also contradicted\nthose members who worried that China’s leadership change could lead to internal struggles\naffecting China’s international and domestic policies. He insisted that such skepticism was\nunwarranted, because what he called the Maoist system had been effectively inculcated\namong the Chinese people. Some members complained that the limited itinerary for\ncongressional visits that was furnished by Chinese hosts did not provide a basis for any\nmeaningful assessment of conditions there. Despite the fact that many congressional\nvisitors questioned how durable China’s Maoist regime was and how lasting China’s\ncooperation with the United States would actually prove to be, Mansfield countered that\nhe had had enough opportunity during his three visits to the PRC to move about and\nobtain enough information through on-the-spot observation and talks with PRC leaders\nto conclude that it was no passing phenomenon. So, while many members thought the\nPRC’s system of indoctrination and control to be repressive politically, economically, and\nsocially—an affront to the human rights and dignity of its people—voices like Mansfield’s\nserved to mute the criticism, maintaining that the country’s political, economic, and social\nsystem was uniquely well suited to the Chinese people.\nSection 1\n12\nInfluence Efforts after Establishing Official Relations, 1979–1988\nAs the Carter administration began moving toward full diplomatic recognition of the\nPRC, it withheld many of the details about its plans from Congress. One of the largest\nunresolved issues was the fate of Taiwan, in which Congress took a special interest. The\nUnited States had already dropped recognition of Taiwan at the United Nations, and now\nmany in Congress worried that the United States would move to completely abandon the\nisland. In response, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, which underlined\nthe importance of the United States keeping an ongoing relationship with Taiwan and\ncontinuing to provide weapons for its defense.\nAfter formal diplomatic relations were reestablished, China responded in the 1980s by\nexpanding the size and capacity of its Washington embassy staff dedicated to dealing with\nCongress. Chinese officials lobbying Congress viewed with dismay the rise of pro-Taiwan\nindependence groups among Taiwanese Americans, such as the Formosan Association\nfor Public Affairs, which demonstrated an ability to promote their agenda despite the\nfact that the United States had broken ties with Taiwan. Beijing would go on to borrow a\npage from the Nationalist government’s playbook by beefing up a diplomatic arm capable\nof building closer relations with important congressional members and staffers. 1 Since\nthen, the Chinese government has welcomed numerous US delegations composed of both\ncongressional members and staffers. The main host in China for such delegations has been\nthe Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs (CPIFA). 2 Founded in December 1949, this\norganization focuses on international issues and foreign policy research and on conducting\ninternational exchanges of officials and expanding people-to-people diplomatic activities.\nThis institute also works to establish contacts with foreign political activists, diplomats,\nand other distinguished individuals while organizing public lectures and symposiums on\nacademic subjects and international policy affairs.\nCPIFA is a so-called united front organization, similar to those found in the former Soviet\nUnion and other Leninist states that seek to opportunistically build alliances wherever\nthey can. Such organizations, or GONGOs (“government-organized non-governmental\norganizations”), carry out government-directed policies and cooperative initiatives with\ninfluential foreigners without being perceived as a formal part of the Chinese government.\nCPIFA’s experience in dealing with foreign visitors is broad. Between 1972 and 2002, it\nhosted more than four thousand leading Americans in China. Being well connected with\nthe Chinese government’s State Council and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is positioned\nto organize meetings with high-level officials when the Party deems it in its interest to do\nso. The funding arrangements for congressional staff delegations visiting China usually\nprovide for their travel to be paid by the US side, so as to avoid falling victim to ethics\ncommittees and overseers or violating rules regarding conflicts of interest and foreign\nlobbying. CPIFA often assumed in-country expenses.\nCongress\n13\nThe staff delegation trips to China were welcomed and sought after by congressional staff\nand congressional support agency personnel, mainly from the Congressional Research\nService of the Library of Congress, which had a growing interest in China and the issues\nit posed for US policy. The trips generally came twice per year and involved meetings with\nChinese government officials and others responsible for key foreign affairs and domestic\nissues of interest to the Congress. The exchanges in these meetings were generally cordial\nand substantive, although the trips also included sightseeing and visits to parts of China of\ninterest to the Congress.\nIn the United States, there have been a number of counterpart groups that have facilitated\ncongressional exchanges. Among them are the Washington, DC-based US-Asia Institute\n(USAI), which has played a leading role in managing the congressional staff delegations\nside since 1985. 3 The National Committee on US-China Relations did a pilot congressional\nstaff delegation visit to China in 1976 and resumed involvement with such exchanges\nagain during the past decade. 4 In the 1980s, the Asia-Pacific Exchange Foundation (also\nknown as the Far East Studies Institute) also managed a number of congressional staff\ndelegations to China, while the US-Asia Institute has, since 1985, coordinated over\n120 such delegations and exchanges to China. These visits have been done in cooperation\nwith the Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs (CPIFA) and the Better Hong Kong\nFoundation (BHKF). But the National People’s Congress (NPC) has perhaps hosted the\nmost trips, taking over a thousand congressional staff members to China. In these trips,\nmembers have traveled to nearly every corner of China, including Xinjiang and Tibet. In\ntheir discussions, they have covered a wide range of themes important to the US-China\nrelationship. Staffers participating in such trips have clearly advanced their understanding\nof Chinese developments.\nCongress and Turmoil in US-China Relations, 1989–2001\nThe number of the congressional staff delegations to China slowed following the collapse\nof congressional support for engagement with China after the Tiananmen crackdown in\n1989. Congressional anger and the impulse to punish the Chinese government overrode\npast interest in constructive engagement. As a result, Beijing began relying more heavily on\nthe US business community and its organizations, notably the Emergency Committee for\nAmerican Trade, to persuade Congress not to end the most-favored nation tariff treatment\nfor Chinese imports. The Chinese embassy and various lobbyists who were, or at least\nclaimed to be, supported by the Chinese government also tried to limit the damage by\nseeking to convince congressional members that conditions in China were much better\nthere than were depicted in American media at the time. 5\nBased on the reputation of its past efforts, the US-Asia Institute, presumably with\nthe encouragement of its Chinese counterparts, strove to resume the staff dialogues\nand attracted a wide range of senior staff and support personnel, including some of\nSection 1\n14\nthose working for the harshest congressional critics of China’s crackdown. One trip in\nDecember 1989 featured very heated debates with Chinese officials, especially after it\nwas announced that National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of\nState Lawrence Eagleburger were also in Beijing for talks with Chinese leaders and that\nthe two had made an earlier secret trip in July, soon after the crackdown. As the Bush\nadministration had publicly promised Congress that all such contacts would end, the staff\ndelegates’ anger at and criticism of China’s repression was compounded by their harsh\nreaction to the Bush administration’s actions.\nAs US-China relations continued during a tumultuous post-Tiananmen crackdown period,\nCongress played important roles on such key issues as the debate over most-favored nation\ntariff treatment, the visit of Taiwan’s president to the United States in 1995, and the decision\nto approve China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. The Chinese government\nendeavored to build influence with and gain access to Congress by encouraging US\nbusinesses to lobby Congress on China’s behalf and by continuing to receive member and\nstaff delegations in China.\nOther entities in the Chinese official structure, including the Chinese Communist Party\nand the Chinese military, at times attempted to gain access to Congress. The International\nDepartment of the Chinese Communist Party engaged in growing exchanges with the\nmajor American political parties on a party-to-party basis. A Chinese “united front”\norganization, the Chinese Association for International Understanding (CAIFU), managed\nsome of these ensuing trips. Also involved was the China Association for International\nFriendly Contact (CAIFC). This “united front” organization’s link to the Chinese\ngovernment was not then well known, though in recent years it has been publicly linked\nto the People’s Liberation Army’s Political Warfare Department, which has intelligence\nresponsibilities. 6 Meanwhile, other exchanges with US congressional specialists on China\nwere promoted by a mysterious “united front” operative with excellent official contacts\nin China named Jimmy Wong. In this troubled decade, Wong made himself known to a\nwide range of Americans playing a role in China policy as having the ability to set up visits\nto China and meetings with key officials very quickly. He occasionally even opened his\nspacious Beijing home to congressional staffers. His precise affiliation with the Chinese\nauthorities remains obscure. 7\nThe approaches of the Chinese government to gain influence and gather information\nabroad differ from the tradecraft of Russia and the former Soviet Union. 8 Notably, the\nChinese focus more on individuals rather than effects, and on shaping the personal\ncontext rather than operational tricks. It is person-to-person relationships that carry the\nweight of Chinese information operations. Working on these personal ties, the Chinese\nauthorities focus on facilitating meetings and contacts that may or may not result in\nopportunities to influence foreign targets. Still, because Chinese influence seeking is\nlargely a governmental undertaking, it is hardly surprising that the Chinese mix influence\nCongress\n15\noperations with espionage. In one instance, after a visit to China supported by CAIFC, an\nAmerican congressional official was asked by two employees at CAIFC who facilitated his\ntrip to host them during a return visit to Washington. He obliged, and they were seemingly\nsatisfied, having shopped extensively during their stay. Subsequently, the Chinese embassy\nofficers who had arranged the congressional official’s visit to China with CAIFC were\narrested and expelled for trying to steal US weapons technology, causing the US official to\nend all contact with CAIFC.\nCurrent Era\nTensions in US-China relations subsided after the terrorist attack on America in September\n2001 and subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq preoccupied the Bush administration\nand Congress. Chinese and American leaders also proved to be sufficiently pragmatic to\nreach common ground on advancing relations in mutually agreeable ways and managing\ndifferences through a wide range of dialogues. Such exchanges only catalyzed visits by\nmore congressional members and staff delegations visits to China. At this time, members\noften traveled to China in US government–funded trips as guests of the US embassy. Some\nmember trips and very frequent staff delegation visits were authorized under provisions\nof the Mutual Education and Cultural Exchange Act (MECEA) that were in line with the\nguidance of congressional ethics committees. 9 In addition to the work of the US-Asia\nInstitute, those organizing and facilitating staff delegations grew to include the Aspen\nInstitute, the National Committee on US-China Relations, and the US-China Policy\nFoundation. 10\nChina also increased its own capacity to engage Congress beyond trips. Having moved into\na new embassy in Washington in 2009, the Chinese embassy increased its congressional\naffairs staff to twelve (as of 2011), while also retaining the lobbying services of the firm\nPatton Boggs. 11 During his time as ambassador, Zhou Wenzhong boasted that he had visited\nsome one hundred members of Congress in their home districts. When certain measures,\nsuch as a bill that would have penalized China for being a “currency manipulator,” came\nbefore Congress, the embassy’s in-house team’s efforts reflected what some US officials\ncalled a much more “nuanced” and “sophisticated” understanding of the body. Whether or\nnot Chinese officials or lobbyists interacting with congressional offices endeavored to exert\ninfluence by means beyond persuasion—such as by offering material benefits or threatening\nto withdraw Chinese investments or other tangible benefits to the congressional district—\nremained hard to discern given the very limited public reporting on such matters. 12\nCongress, for its part, had already formalized efforts to better understand China through\na variety of working groups. By 2006, both the House and the Senate had formed a\nUS-China Inter-Parliamentary Exchange Group, which conducted periodic exchanges with\nChina’s National People’s Congress. Also showing stronger American interest in China at\nthat time were the Congressional China Caucus (led by members tending to be critical\nSection 1\n16\nof China); the China Working Group (led by members supportive of closer engagement\nwith China); and the Senate China Working Group (led by members supportive of closer\nrelations). Earlier legislation had established the Congressional-Executive Commission\non China, focused on human rights conditions in China (a perennial negative aspect\nin US‐China relations), and the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission,\nwhich was known for its annual report listing a variety of developments in China seen\nas adverse to US interests and values. While the latter two commissions continue to be\nactive, are robust, and have growing impact, many of the other exchange mechanisms\nhave proven less than durable. Once the leading members who founded such groups leave\nCongress, interest usually wanes. The National People’s Congress became even more active\nin supporting the growing number of congressional staff delegations to China during\nthis period. In 2018, the House China Working Group remained active, but the House\nCongressional China Caucus and the Senate China Working Group were inactive.\nMost recently, the 115th Congress has actively embraced the Trump administration’s view\nthat China has benefited more from the bilateral relationship than has the United States.\nIn fact, amidst all the partisan warfare currently dividing Republicans and Democrats in\nWashington, a skepticism about China’s intentions and reliability and a willingness to\npush back in a bipartisan manner against its un-reciprocal, and sometimes even predatory,\npolicies, is one of the most surprising phenomena. In 2018, for example, the Congress\nunanimously passed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages the Trump administration to\nhost more high-ranking officials from Taiwan, a move that angered Beijing. Still, Congress is\nhardly united, even on trade. Some members have objected to the adverse impacts punitive\ntariffs are having on their constituencies, or they have opposed imposing tariffs on allies\nat the same time tariffs are imposed on China. And some members criticized President\nTrump’s decision in May 2018 to ease harsh sanctions against the prominent Chinese\nhigh-technology firm ZTE, in response to a personal plea from the Chinese president.\nNevertheless, President Trump’s dominance in the Republican Party means that few in the\nRepublican ranks controlling Congress are inclined to oppose him, especially on China.\nIndeed, Congress is generally endorsing the most significant reevaluation of American-\nChina policy since the start of normalization fifty years ago. As such, it can be said that\nChinese influence on Capitol Hill has reached a low point.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nCongress is in the midst of a major reevaluation of the very assumptions underlying\nthe decades-old American policy of “engagement” with China. Because of this increasingly\ncompetitive, even adversarial, new climate, Chinese influence and information operations\nare widely coming to be seen as expressions of a political system whose values are\nantithetical to those of the United States and as a threat to the integrity of Congress and\nour democracy. Arguing, as many have done as far back as Majority Leader Mike Mansfield,\nthat Congress should move forward with positive engagement with China while seeking to\nCongress\n17\npragmatically manage our differences now seems, in the current environment, both naïve\nand quixotic.\nPromote Transparency\nFollow-on congressional oversight will go far toward educating the Congress, the media,\nand the public about these important topics. The issues are complicated and have no simple\nsolutions. Various specialists within and outside the US government should be consulted\nin determining the full scope of the problem and what should be done.\nPromote Integrity\nCongress needs also to distinguish between issues that present a real threat to the United\nStates, such as Chinese espionage and Chinese-directed monitoring of Chinese students\non US campuses, and institutions such as Confucius Institutes, which, as we have noted\nelsewhere in this report, can be better regulated by universities themselves.\nPromote Reciprocity\nIn coming up with remedial steps, Congress must consider the broader bilateral relationship.\nIt is asked to weigh carefully the continued important positive elements in the US-China\nrelationship, the negative consequences that might arise from a confrontational approach\nto China, and America’s need to protect and foster its strengths and interests.\nNOTES\n1 ​Sources for the information and judgments in this section include: United States Congress.

The American partner city was home\nto a large number of national security professionals and university and government\nscientists, including many of PRC origin. The partnership was proposed and\nshepherded by the manager of a for-profit Chinese “exchanges” company—a woman\nof PRC origin. She was assisted by an American citizen of PRC origin who was running\nfor a position on the local school board.\nIn a briefing, an American China expert told the local sister city committee that there\nwas no reason not to explore a partnership, provided the American side had defined\ngoals and was aware of Beijing’s increasingly repressive domestic policies, its growing\nsuspicions of US influence, and its well-funded efforts to increase its influence overseas.\nThe man running for the local school board objected to this characterization and\npointed out that China’s constitution gives the CCP paramount authority in China.\nAfter a long debate, the new sister city agreement was signed in the fall of 2018.\nSome Americans involved objected to China’s insistence that all sister city activities\nbe carried out “in accordance with the principles on the establishment of diplomatic\nrelations between the United States of America and the People’s Republic of China\n( 根据中美两国建交原则 ),” because this seemed to be a reference to the One China\nPrinciple, which might be invoked to preclude exchanges with Taiwan. Despite these\nobjections, the phrase appeared in the signed agreement because the Chinese side said\nthat the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries required\nthat all sister city agreements include such language and the US side did not want to\nderail the agreement by insisting otherwise.\nThe story of this sister city agreement illustrates the challenges and opportunities\n“sub-national entities” (local governments, cities, and states) face in the United States\nwhen dealing with a China intent on maximizing its influence in America and across\nthe globe. As this report details in other sections, the age of innocent engagement\nis over, and this is now true for American local officials as well as for representatives\n20\nof the US federal government. Because most PRC attempts to influence American\nopinion and practices occur at the local level, and because local media, universities,\ncompanies, and advocacy agencies are often involved in these efforts, knowingly and\nunknowingly, local leaders, just as much as national leaders, need an understanding\nof PRC goals and strategies.\n“We Have Friends All Over the World”\nChina pursues sister city relationships under an organization called the Chinese\nPeople’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, which is part of China’s\nunited front bureaucratic structure (See Appendix: Chinese Influence Operations\nBureaucracy) that aims to strengthen the rule of the Chinese Communist Party and\nincrease China’s influence overseas. With its long-standing Maoist slogan, “We Have\nFriends All Over the World,” the association had its heyday in the 1950s, when China\nwas isolated and the group became a bridge between China and overseas supporters.\nIt was marginalized in the 1980s, as China opened to the West and established\ndiplomatic relations with hundreds of countries. However, under the administration of\nCommunist Party leader Xi Jinping, the association has been revitalized as China seeks\nto groom local business, political, and media leaders in countries around the world. Its\nnew standing is exemplified by the splendor of its headquarters located in the elegant\nold Italian Embassy compound near Tiananmen Square.\nThe way the association and other Chinese organizations cultivate relationships\nwith local officials follows a general pattern. First, in the United States, China\ndemands that sister city relationships and state-to-province sister relations be carried\nout under “principles” on which Sino-US relations were established in the 1970s\n(as interpreted by the Chinese side). This means that China’s representatives will\nlikely protest should local officials seek to maintain ties with representatives of Taiwan\nor with other individuals, such as the Dalai Lama, whom China regards as hostile\nforces. Second, it is important to understand why China seeks a relationship with\nlocalities, especially during times of tension with the federal government: China\nseeks to build alternative networks of interaction and support, while using these new\nrelationships to help gain new traction back in Washington. Local American expertise,\ninformation, and opinion are also of more than passing political interest to Beijing,\neven if on paper an exchange relationship is only to “enhance people’s friendship,\nfurther international cooperation, safeguard world peace and promote common\ndevelopment,” 1 for Beijing understands clearly that local leaders today become the\nState and Local Governments\n21\nnational leaders of tomorrow. For China, all exchanges have a political character and\nhopefully a political harvest.\nThird, it is important for local officials to understand that local American “exchange”\ncompanies that bring Chinese delegations to the United States and promote\nprofessional interactions between the United States and China all depend on official\nPRC sanction and have received approval to receive Chinese delegations. The business\nmodel of such companies is, of necessity, as much political as financial. Even if they\nconduct high-quality programs, they should not be viewed as disinterested actors.\nThey, too, are subject to rules made by the Chinese Communist Party, its united front\nbureaucracy, and united front strategic imperatives.\nFinally, American citizens of PRC origin have played a key role in promoting mutually\nbeneficial engagement over the past forty years. As US-China relations grow more\ncontentious, however, and as Beijing calls more aggressively for diaspora Chinese to\nserve the “motherland,” it will be necessary for citizen diplomats (including those who\nare not of PRC origin) to better educate themselves about American national interests\nin the US-China competition and the areas in which the nation’s values, institutional\npractices, and strategic goals are incompatible. Such awareness is even more vital for\nChinese Americans who seek political office and whose abilities to navigate these\nshoals will depend on their knowledge of this complex system of interaction.\nAmerican Communities as Engines of Engagement\nThe American federal system allows sub-national governments considerable leeway\nto pursue local interests generally regardless of Washington’s security concerns. Free\nfrom geostrategic worries, state, county, and municipal leaders who have formed\ncommercial and people-to-people relationships with the PRC have been a bulwark\nof better US‐China relations since the early 1970s, and their efforts to build mutual\nunderstanding and solve joint problems formed the bedrock of bilateral relations over\nfour decades. However, as China becomes more reliant on its old Leninist system and\n“united front” tactics ( 统战战略 ), Sino-US relations become more contentious, and\nthe CCP seeks to more forcefully build influence in American communities through\nchannels detailed in this study, local leaders will be called upon to give greater\nweight to national interests when forming exchange relationships with PRC actors.\nConversely, as Beijing’s relations with Washington worsen, China will likely seek to\nuse tried-and-true “divide and conquer” tactics by cultivating new relations with more\nstate and local-level officials.\nSection 2\n22\nBeginning in the early 1970s, China and the United States built trust and common\nprosperity through cooperation at the local level. The work of two hundred sister city\npairs and over forty sister state/province partnerships was reinforced by state and city\ntrade and investment promotion offices, chambers of commerce, Chinese American\nand traditional clan associations, Chinatown cultural centers, and various and sundry\nactivities at US colleges and universities, secondary schools, church groups, and\nmuseums. Following the establishment of the pioneering Washington State China\nRelations Council in 1979, 2 centers for joint innovation and entrepreneurship, such as\nthe Michigan China Innovation Center 3 and the Maryland China Business Council 4\nwere set up in nearly every state. Twenty-seven states now maintain trade offices in\nChina—more than in any other nation. 5 Americans of Mainland, Taiwanese, and\nHong Kong ancestry have founded cultural centers like the Asia Institute–Crane House\nin Louisville, Kentucky, 6 and the China Institute in New York. 7 After forty years of\nengagement, the US-China focused foundations, educational and exchange programs,\nresearch institutes, and arts and entertainment initiatives throughout the country\nare too many and various to be cataloged. American mayors, county executives, and\ngovernors—many of whom travel to China often and host an unending stream of\nChinese visitors—have leveraged the work of these groups to enrich local coffers and\nlocal culture.\nAmerican Communities as Targets\nWhile American local governments value such “exchanges” for financial and cultural\nreasons, “exchange” ( 交流 ) has always been viewed as a practical political tool by\nBeijing, 8 and all of China’s “exchange” organizations have been assigned political\nmissions. The US-China People’s Friendship Association, for example, has over thirty\nsections across the United States that promote “positive ties.” While its activities\nare not usually overtly political, the USCPFA Statement of Principles includes the\nfollowing: “We recognize that friendship between our two peoples must be based on the\nknowledge of and respect for the sovereignty of each country; therefore, we respect\nthe declaration by the United States of America and the People’s Republic of China that\nthe resolution of the status of Taiwan is the internal affair of the Chinese on both sides\nof the Taiwan Straits.” 9 Some 190 Chinese Students and Scholars Associations 10 (CSSA)\nat American colleges and universities (see the section on “Universities”) also promote\nlocal exchanges and, in some cases, political activities, 11 as do the 110 Confucius\nInstitutes in America. The China General Chamber of Commerce–USA was founded\nin 2005 to build stronger investment environments for Chinese companies through\nlocal corporate citizenship programs planned by its six regional offices and municipal\nState and Local Governments\n23\naffiliates. 12 These and other organizations maintain close ties to China’s diplomatic\nmissions in the United States and are often in contact with training or “cultural\nexchange” companies that bring delegations of PRC experts and Communist Party\nmembers to US cities and states for so-called study tours.\nUS and Chinese groups promoting exchanges and investment have often been a\nvaluable resource for American local leaders—see, for example, the Virginia Museum of\nFine Arts annual China Fest 13 or the Chinese investment program in Greenville, South\nCarolina 14 —but there have been other instances in which American politicians working\nwith Chinese organizations have been drawn into schemes that cost them their jobs.\nPerhaps the most telling case is that of four officials in Ypsilanti, Michigan, who, in\n2017, accepted a trip to China that they had been told was paid for by the Wayne State\nCSSA. The trip was eventually revealed as a boondoggle funded by a developer, Amy\nXue Foster, who hoped to build a $300 million “Chinatown” in the area. 15 The four\nofficials, including the mayor, were fired.\nThis is not to suggest that shady Chinese nationals are always plotting to corrupt\notherwise innocent American leaders; US politicians have a long history of willingly\naccepting free trips, gifts, and other favors from the PRC or its fronts. As other\nsections of this study make clear, however, Beijing-directed activities such as the secret\npurchase of American Chinese-language newspapers and radio stations, harassment of\nlocal Chinese American dissidents, and the operation of CCP cells in local American\nbusinesses and universities do require heightened vigilance by US sub-national\nauthorities, regardless of how much investment, how many tuition-paying students,\nor how many tourists China is able to produce.\nChina Exchanges and Chinese Leverage\nThe over forty years of engagement with China has created for American cities\nand states, as it has for American corporations and universities, deep interests and\ntraditions with regard to China. However, the local policies that have guided these\nrelationships are sometimes at odds with Washington’s policies, even our larger\nnational interest. Although the United States has pulled out of the Paris Agreement, the\nseventeen governors who have joined the United States Climate Alliance, for example,\ncontinue to work with Beijing, which many would agree is a very salutary thing. But\nsometimes sub-national solidarity with China can become overexuberant, as it did\non a July 2018 trip to Hong Kong by Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who declared\nSection 2\n24\nhis city’s independence from the looming Sino-US trade war. Garcetti stated that Los\nAngeles and China “have closely integrated economies, closely integrated cultures and\nclosely integrated geography. . . . ​We hope to be the leading Chinese city in America\nfor investment, tourism and students.” 17\nSometimes federalism, in the form of local leaders’ independent China policies,\nis a good thing and may, during times of upheaval in Washington, DC, help to\noffset unwise national policies. But if US-China relations continue on their current\ndownward trajectory, there will be an increased danger that independent state and\nmunicipal China policies will sometimes conflict with national interest and hinder the\nUnited States in its competition with China to shape global norms\nand practices. As China’s wealth and ambition grow and as Beijing is becoming more\nadept at turning local American “China interests” into Chinese leverage, sub-national\nAmerican governmental entities that formed their China policies in the Era of\nEngagement must become mindful that a new era will require them to develop new\nstrategies for a new Era of Competition.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nThe following practices can foster the kind of constructive vigilance that local\ngovernments will need to exercise in their continued cooperation with China.\nPromote Transparency\nSub-national governments should:\n• Not have secret agreements with Chinese entities, including foundations,\ncorporations, or individuals. All MOUs and contracts should be transparent\nand public. All cooperative proposals should be subject to public hearings.\nAll potential projects should receive the same due diligence that partnerships\nwith American entities would demand. No exceptions to American laws or best\npractices should be made to placate allegedly “Chinese” customs. And in no way\nshould China be allowed to have a veto over potential exchanges with other\ncountries, entities, or individuals such as Taiwan or the Dalai Lama.\n• Share experiences and concerns with peers through the National Conference of\nMayors, the National Governors Association, the National Council of County\nAssociation Executives, and the National Conference of State Legislatures. Best\nState and Local Governments\n25\npractices for cooperating with China in ways that do not undermine national\ninterests should be a regular topic at annual meetings.\n• Meet with stakeholders across sectors—local leaders of industry, academia,\nthe arts, religious groups, Chinese American organizations, and professional\nassociations—to discuss issues emerging from cooperation with China, because a\ncommunity-wide approach is required.\n• Celebrate successes and share best practices. In the era of US-China competition,\nthere is more reason than ever to publicize cooperative projects that enrich local\ncommunities, build understanding, and solve common problems, while always\nbeing mindful of the larger framework of China’s goal and American interests.\nPromote Integrity\nSub-national governments should:\n• Educate themselves and other stakeholders on the goals and methods of\nChinese influence operations. While Americans are quick to label any\nwariness of communist parties as McCarthyism, and while the potential for\nracial stereotyping is real, the Chinese Communist Party’s United Front Work\nDepartment and International Liaison Department—two of the main bodies\noverseeing such exchanges—are in fact active and well resourced and determined.\nNo mainland Chinese organization in the United States—corporate, academic, or\npeople-to-people—is free of Beijing’s control, even if it is not formally part of the\nUnited Front.\n• Keep abreast of Washington’s China policies and improve political risk\nanalysis capabilities. American China policy is evolving rapidly and cannot be\nincorporated into local practice without expert counsel and advice. China’s\nresponses to US actions are also fast-moving, as are Chinese domestic events\nthat have an impact on local American interests. The 2018 sell-off of Chineseowned\nproperties in the United States was instructive in this regard. 18 State and\nmunicipal governments should therefore improve their political risk analysis\ncapabilities and continually reassess their cooperative relationships with China.\nIn effect, to successfully play in the China arena, sub-nationals need to develop\ntheir own sources of expertise.\nSection 2\n26\n• Communicate regularly with federal agencies like the FBI whenever doubts arise\nabout a cooperative proposal or the Chinese institutions promoting it. Pay attention\nto who is on Chinese delegations. Get name lists beforehand and do due diligence\non them.\nPromote Reciprocity\nSub-national governments should:\n• Follow the money, and the power. In any cooperative venture, US local\ngovernments should determine exactly where Chinese investments originate and\nknow which Beijing ministry has final decision-making authority related to the\nproject. They should also check lists of funders and organizations against lists of\nknown United Front agencies and registered foreign agents.\n• Not treat other stakeholders—other countries, Taiwan, or companies—in a\nprejudiced manner to win favor in Beijing.\nNOTES\n1 ​As promised in the referenced sister cities agreement.\n2 ​Washington State China Relations Council. https://www​.wscrc​.org.\n3 ​Michigan-China Innovation Center. https:// www​. michiganchina​. org.\n4 ​Maryland-China Business Council. http://www​.mcbc​.net.\n5 ​Burnett, Jennifer. “State Overseas Trade Offices, 2015.” Council of State Governments.

Although they form a vital strand in the social fabric of the United\nStates, Beijing also views Chinese Americans as members of a worldwide Chinese diaspora\nthat, whatever the actual citizenship of individuals may be, presumes them to retain\nnot only an interest in the welfare of China but also a loosely defined cultural, and even\npolitical, allegiance to the so-called Motherland ( 祖国 ). Under Xi Jinping’s leadership,\ndiaspora Chinese have been called on to help achieve the Rejuvenation of the Chinese\nNation—a summons that places growing pressure on ethnic Chinese around the world to\nserve the “China Dream” ( 中国梦 ). While many overseas Chinese do feel pride in China as a\ncountry and the Chinese as a race, Beijing’s claims on their loyalty can have the untoward\neffect of calling into question their devotion to their own home nations.\nUnder both the Nationalist and Communist parties, overseas Chinese have played an\nimportant role in modern Chinese politics as well as in China’s relations with the outside\nworld. Diaspora communities worldwide have been key sources of legitimacy and support\nfor whatever government held power in Beijing, but just as often they have been centers of\nantigovernment agitation. With PRC influence-seeking activities now expanding, China’s\nlong-standing focus on diaspora communities has also intensified to become an important\nelement in overall US-China relations. Such trends demand not only greater societal\nattention and understanding but also an appropriate response from the US government\nas well as non-governmental institutions.\nAs the Chinese Communist Party seeks to encourage, even entice, ethnic-Chinese\ncommunities and individuals overseas to more fully support its interests, the Chinese\nAmericans in the United States and other free societies need to better inform themselves\nas to the nature of this dynamic, and our governmental institutions may need to do more\nto defend their freedoms against harmfully intrusive and coercive activities. At the same\ntime, it is essential that we not allow overseas Chinese as an ethnic group to fall under\nany kind indiscriminate cloud of suspicion. Above all, it is important to bear in mind\nthat while ethnic Chinese can be quite naturally expected to take an interest in things\nChinese, it is the Chinese Communist Party that puts a target on their backs through its\npresumption that they are all somehow the “sons and daughters of the Yellow Emperor”\n( 炎黄子孙 ) and thus owe some measure of loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party.\n30\nOrigins and Structure\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, when the United States maintained an alliance with the\nregime of Chiang Kai-shek on Taiwan, pro-PRC organizations faced challenges gaining\ntraction in the United States. During the 1950s, the FBI, aided by pro-Kuomintang security\norganizations, closely monitored their activities and participants. This antagonistic state\nof affairs began to change after President Nixon’s historic trip to China in 1972. 1 On\nFebruary 24, 1973, more than forty Chinese on the East Coast, most of them immigrants\nfrom Taiwan, established the Washington Association to Promote China Unification to\nhelp advocate for Beijing’s official positions. One of the founders was a professor at the\nUniversity of Maryland who was actively involved in organizations that already supported\nChina’s position on Taiwan and Tibet. 2 However, a more beneficial contribution came\nin the form of advancing US-China scientific, educational, and cultural exchanges that\nstarted to be promoted by a growing number of preeminent Chinese American scientists,\nengineers, and academics who were also advising the Chinese government to launch\nreforms in science and education. These Chinese Americans were also personally helping\nthem establish various programs to bring thousands of talented Chinese students to\nAmerican institutions of learning.\nRecognizing the achievements, influence, and growth of the Chinese diaspora, Beijing\nundertook a systematic program designed to target and exploit overseas Chinese\ncommunities as a means of furthering its own political, economic, and security interests.\nThe Beijing government used specialized bureaucracies to manage what it called “united\nfront” activities abroad. Organizations such as the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office inside\nthe Communist Party Central Committee’s United Front Work Department 3 and the State\nCouncil’s Taiwan Affairs Office led the charge. Almost all of these agencies have established\nnongovernmental fronts overseas, including the China Council for the Promotion of\nPeaceful National Reunification, the China Overseas Exchange Association, and the China\nOverseas Friendship Association. 4 Other “united front” organizations, such as the Chinese\nEnterprise Association and other Chinese chambers of commerce, are almost always linked\nboth to the United Front Work Department and to the Ministry of Commerce.\nFollowing the violent crackdown on the prodemocracy movement in Beijing on June 4,\n1989, the Chinese Communist Party redoubled its efforts to reach out to overseas Chinese.\nMany members of these communities had supported the student democracy movement,\nproviding funds and safe havens for fleeing dissidents. But senior Chinese leader Deng\nXiaoping was not dissuaded. In 1989 and again in 1993, he spoke of the “unique\nopportunity” overseas Chinese offered the PRC. Deng insisted that by drawing on their\nhelp, China could break out of international isolation and improve its international\npolitical standing. Gaining influence over overseas Chinese groups in order to “turn them\ninto propaganda bases for China” became an important task of overseas Chinese united\nfront work. 5\nThe Chinese American Community\n31\nIn China, all of the organizations involved in outreach to the overseas Chinese community\nare led by senior members of the Chinese Communist Party. Sun Chunlan, the former\nhead of the United Front Work Department, is listed as the president of the China Overseas\nFriendship Association and the executive vice president of the China Council to Promote\nPeaceful Reunification. The head of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, Qiu Yuanping,\nalso leads the China Overseas Exchange Association. Madame Qiu has a career background\nwith the Party’s International Liaison Department. The president of the China Council for\nthe Promotion of Peaceful Reunification is none other than Yu Zhengsheng, the former\nchairman of the Chinese People’s Consultative Conference and a former member of the\nStanding Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party’s Central Committee. 6\nGoals and Methods\nThe key goal of the Party’s united front work with overseas Chinese is to gain support for\nthe Communist Party’s efforts to modernize the country by convincing members of overseas\nChinese communities that the Party is the sole representative of China and to isolate\ncompeting forces that the Party perceives to be adversarial, or even hostile. For example,\nas part of a massive campaign to monitor, control, and even intimidate China’s ethnic\nminorities (no matter where in the world they are), Chinese authorities are creating a global\nregistry of Uighurs who live outside of China. Chinese authorities threatening to detain\nUighur relatives who remain in China if they do not provide personal information of their\nrelatives living abroad to the Chinese police. This campaign has particularly targeted Uighurs\nliving in Germany but is now reaching Uighurs in the United States as well. 7 Uighurs are not\nalone; Tibetan exiles living in the United States have long reported similar campaigns against\nmembers of their families and community. Chinese security officials have even been known\nto travel to America on tourist visas to exert pressure on Chinese dissidents living here. 8 FBI\nagents have contacted prominent Chinese exiles in the United States offering them protection\nfrom Chinese agents who might travel to the United States to menace them. 9\nFor most Chinese Americans, however, China’s efforts to influence them are far more\nanodyne. The official description of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office (OCAO) states\nits purpose as: “to enhance unity and friendship in overseas Chinese communities; to\nmaintain contact with and support overseas Chinese media and Chinese language schools;\n[and] to increase cooperation and exchanges between overseas Chinese and China related\nto the economy, science, culture and education.” Over the past three decades, the OCAO\nhas dispatched former reporters and editors from the OCAO-run China News Service to\nestablish pro-Beijing Chinese media organizations in the West. (Chinese officials have\ndescribed such Chinese-language media outlets, schools, and other kinds of organizations as\nthe “three treasures” ( 三宝 ) of united front work overseas.) 10\nOfficials from Beijing have stated clearly that they do not view overseas Chinese as simple\ncitizens of foreign countries, but rather as “overseas compatriots” ( 华侨同胞们 ) who have both\nSection 3\n32\nhistorical connections and responsibilities as “sons and daughters of the Yellow Emperor”\nto support the PRC’s goals and the “China Dream.” As Xi Jinping 11 described it in a 2014\nspeech to the Seventh Conference of Overseas Chinese Associations, “The Rejuvenation of\nthe Chinese Nation is a Dream shared by all Chinese” [emphasis added]. In January 2018,\nPolitburo member and former state counselor and foreign minister Yang Jiechi made this\npresumption even clearer when he called upon the government to expand and strengthen\n“Overseas Chinese Patriotic Friendly Forces” in the service of the “Great Rejuvenation” of\nthe Chinese nation.\nIn addition to appealing to the cultural affinities of Chinese Americans, the Chinese\ngovernment has also implemented a wide range of programs to strengthen ties with\nelite members of this community. China has appointed hundreds of Chinese Americans\nto positions in its united front organizations and provided thousands with free trips to\nChina, during which they have been feted by senior united front officials. In some cases,\nChinese Americans are offered senior positions in united front organizations. For example,\nin 2013, one Chinese American, a native of Guangdong Province, became the first and\nonly foreigner to become a vice president of the Chinese Overseas Friendship Association\n(COFA). 12\nChina has used this tactic of handing out what one senior Chinese American called\n“honors” to Chinese Americans as a way for united front departments, and even\nespionage agencies, to cultivate contacts in the United States, often to the detriment of\nother groups—such as Tibetans, Taiwanese independence supporters, supporters of the\nRepublic of China, Uighurs, prodemocracy activists, and other independent Chinese\nvoices with which the Party does not agree. Chinese Americans appointed to such\npositions in organizations established by the Communist Party have subsequently led\nprotests against Taiwan and Tibet and participated in campaigns to silence Chinese\ndissidents, such as the exiled billionaire Guo Wengui. For example, a Chinese American\nwho is a vice president of COFA spearheaded a campaign against Guo that was encouraged\nby officials from the PRC. On a video posted to YouTube, this individual is seen railing\nagainst Guo, vowing that he will “not rest” until Guo is returned to China to answer\ncharges against him. 13\nUnited Front organizations in China have been surprisingly aggressive and transparent\nin their public tasking of Chinese Americans to carry out activities that support the PRC\npolicies. One example occurred after the 19th Party congress in October 2017. The stateowned\nFujian Daily reported on November 24, 2017, that representatives of local Chinese\ncommunity associations based in the United States, Australia, the Philippines, and Europe\nhad gathered in Fujian and received letters of appointment from local provincial and city\nUnited Front agencies in China to serve officially as “overseas propaganda agents” on their\nreturn to their home countries. These commissions obliged them to accept responsibility for\npromoting the decisions of the Party’s recent national congress in their home countries. The\nThe Chinese American Community\n33\narticle noted that this practice of offering Party commissions to overseas Chinese to work\noverseas on united front tasks was not new. The president of the United Fujianese American\nAssociation ( 美国福建公所 ) told reporters: “I have received quite a few letters of appointment\non previous occasions, but none for which I have felt such deep significance as the one\ntoday. It’s a heavy responsibility.” 14\nPeaceful Reunification Councils\nA key goal of PRC overseas activities is to convince, and sometimes pressure, Chinese in\nthe United States to accept that the PRC government in Beijing is the sole representative\nof China and Chinese, and that the Republic of China on Taiwan is an illegitimate\ngovernment. To this end, in 1988, the Party’s United Front Work Department founded the\nChina Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification, and the Washington,\nDC, Association to Promote China Unification was folded into the council. The DC\nchapter’s assignment was to organize concerts, demonstrations, and other gatherings\nto support the PRC. 15 Other chapters soon opened, so that by 2018, the council had\nestablished thirty-three in the United States and more than two hundred branches overseas.\nIn America, these organizations are generally registered as domestic nonprofit community\norganizations, even though their leadership in Beijing includes senior members of the\nChinese Communist Party. Indeed, an article in the People’s Daily, the mouthpiece of\nthe Chinese Communist Party, spoke in glowing terms about how useful the Peaceful\nReunification Councils were in furthering China’s goals of taking over Taiwan, noting\nthat while chapters of the Peaceful Reunification Council complied with US law by\nregistering as nonprofits, they were established to support Chinese government policies\nand coordinate activities with PRC consulates in the United States. 16 “Over the years, the\nChina Peaceful Reunification Council in Northern California has actively cooperated\nwith the local Chinese consulate to work against ‘Taiwan independence’ and promote\nnational reunification activities, and has some influence in San Francisco’s overseas Chinese\ncommunity,” the Northern California Council candidly notes on its website. 17\nAround the United States, the councils count numerous prominent Chinese Americans as\nmembers. For example, one successful California businesswoman was for years the honorary\nchairwoman of the council in Northern California. 18 While helping promote US-China\neducational exchanges, this individual has also consistently advocated on behalf of PRC\npolicies in the United States, including China’s claims on Taiwan, and has helped to organize\ndemonstrations against “Taiwan independence.” She is listed as an advisor to the China\nOverseas Exchange Association, which is part of the United Front Work Department. 19\nThe Chinese government has also sought to co-opt local Chinese American community\nassociations to serve its goals. 20 In the past, organizations such as regional associations,\nknown as Tongs ( 同乡会 ), had generally been close to the Nationalist government of Taiwan.\nIn San Francisco, however, that began to change as early as the 1980s when Soon Suey\nSection 3\n34\nSing, one of San Francisco’s six major community organizations representing Chinese\nimmigrants, became the first major Chinese group to fly the flag of the PRC on its building.\nThen a second Tong declared its fealty to Beijing, and a competition broke out between the\nPRC and Taiwan in San Francisco’s Chinatown to see which side could fly the most flags.\nThis competition can be vividly seen from the seventeenth floor of a public housing project\noverlooking Chinatown, where PRC and Republic of China flags sit atop adjacent buildings\nstretching into the horizon. The value of these associations to Beijing can be seen in this\nexample: When China’s president Xi Jinping visited the United States in September 2015,\none of the leaders of San Francisco’s local Chinese American community associations\nwas listed as first among twenty prominent Chinese Americans honored by the Chinese\npresident. 21\nChinese Americans and the Chinese People’s Consultative Conference\nSeveral Chinese Americans are so trusted by Beijing that they are direct participants in\nChina’s most prominent national united front body, the Chinese People’s Consultative\nConference (CPPCC). The preamble of China’s constitution defines the Chinese People’s\nPolitical Consultative Conference as “a broadly based representative organization of the\nunited front which . . . ​will play a still more important role in the country’s political and\nsocial life, in promoting friendship with other countries and in the struggle for socialist\nmodernization and for the reunification and unity of the country.” In practice, the CPPCC\nhas served as an important advisory committee to help legitimize Chinese Communist\nParty’s rule both domestically and abroad.\nBeijing has been appointing Chinese Americans to the CPPCC for years. In some cases,\nauthorities in Beijing seem to have had problems finding appropriately influential\nAmericans to take seats on the committee, such as in 2017, when a Chinese property\ndeveloper and educator (who appears to still be a Chinese citizen) was one of seven\n“Americans” listed as CPPCC members. 22\nIn doling out prestigious positions on the CPPCC, China seeks to show overseas\nChinese that prominent members of their community want to be connected with\nChina’s government. The American contingent to the thirteenth CPPCC (announced in\nMarch 2018) was no exception. Perhaps the most remarkable in years, the list of thirtyfive\noverseas representatives included four highly successful Chinese American academics,\nscientists, and businessmen. 23\nThe appointment of Chinese Americans to positions on this advisory body to the Chinese\nCommunist Party raises difficult questions of divided national loyalty. Americans should,\nof course, be free to participate in whatever organizations they see fit, since freedom of\nassociation is hardwired into the constitutional DNA of the United States. However, the\nCPPCC is not an independent civil society NGO, but an organization controlled, managed,\nThe Chinese American Community\n35\nand dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. Members are expected to adhere to the\ndisciplines and goals of the Party and work to strengthen China and the Party’s rule of\nChina. Members of the CPPCC are expected to write reports about how their activities have\naligned with China’s interests and to detail their work on China’s behalf. 24 The potential\nexploitation of Chinese American members in this body by the Chinese government not\nonly risks harming the interests of the United States but also has the potential to harm the\nsecurity, reputation, and welfare of these Chinese Americans.\nA similar quandary could present itself to those Chinese Americans who have chosen\nto accept positions as consultants for another united front organization, the All-China\nFederation of Returned Overseas Chinese, which also serves the Party’s interests. In 2018,\ntwelve representatives from the United States, including wealthy businessmen and civic\nleaders, were listed as advisors of the Federation’s 10 th congress. The Chinese government\npicked them in recognition of their prominence and efforts in advocating positions friendly\nto Beijing. 25\nTo engender a sense of close support, state-owned Chinese media outlets routinely report\nabout such contacts made between prominent Chinese Americans and senior Chinese\nofficials. There are literally hundreds of such reports in the Chinese-language press\nabout prominent Chinese Americans escorting leading figures from China’s united front\nbureaucracy in the United States or being hosted by them in China. 26 In May 2017, Li\nKexin, the deputy chief of mission at the Chinese embassy in Washington, praised the\nPeaceful Reunification Council’s DC chapter for holding a “peaceful reunification forum”\nin Washington and for opposing Taiwan’s independence. 27 Officials from China have also\ntraveled freely to the United States to take part in conferences and activities designed\nto further China’s influence operations in the United States. For example, United Front\nofficials traveled to the United States in November 2016 for the council’s annual executive\nmeeting, during which the council pledged to renew its efforts to “oppose Taiwan’s\nindependence.” 28\nConclusion and Recommendations\nAs US citizens, Chinese Americans enjoy the same constitutional rights of freedom of speech,\nassociation, and political participation as everyone else, and their exercise of these rights is\nfully legitimate and protected by the Constitution and law. What’s more, it is incumbent\non the United States government and American society as a whole not to demonize\nChinese Americans for their feelings for and pride in China. However, it is also important\nthat all American citizens be aware that such feelings can sometimes be exploited by an\nauthoritarian regime to advance its goals and interests. Here it is not Chinese Americans who\nare at fault for having an attachment to their “motherland,” but it is the Chinese Communist\nParty for cynically attempting to use Chinese Americans to further its own interests in the\nprocess making overseas Chinese communities vulnerable to distrust.\nSection 3\n36\nWhile the US government needs to adopt a no-tolerance policy toward attempts by Chinese\nsecurity forces to travel to the United States to secretly harass, manipulate, intimidate, and\nmonitor China’s perceived enemies in the United States, the best antidote to such intrusion\nis for federal and local governments to do more to strengthen ties to Chinese American\ncommunities and to give greater visibility into the various inducements and pressures\nBeijing exerts on these communities. That the FBI has begun to reach out to prominent\nChinese in the United States, offering protection, is a good beginning.\nA sustained education campaign is also urgently needed to inform the members of the\nChinese American community of the potential adverse consequences of involvement with\nChina’s united front activities. Chinese American organizations also need to do a better job\nof informing themselves about the underlying goals of PRC’s united front organizations\nas there are potential reputational costs of allying with them and losing independence. It\ncan be taken as a positive sign that, for example, the Committee of 100, an organization\nfounded by many illustrious Chinese Americans, has begun to debate the possibility of\nbarring its leading members from accepting positions with PRC united front organizations\nofficially aligned with the Chinese Communist Party. 29\nChina’s activities in the United States can also be made more transparent by requiring\nspin-off groups from united front organizations in Beijing to register under the Foreign\nAgent Registration Act as agents of a foreign power. This would include all of the bureaus\nof the Peaceful Reunification Council, the China Overseas Exchange Association, and the\nChina Overseas Friendship Association, among others that are, in fact, influence-seeking\norganizations with political implications run by a foreign state. In addition, Chinese\nAmericans who accept positions in united front structures—such as the Chinese People’s\nPolitical Consultative Conference—should also be required to register as agents of a foreign\npower seeking influence in the United States. China has tried to sell these “honors” to\nthe Chinese American community as a costfree way of expressing their sincere feelings\nof pride in China. However, the reality is that once a person accepts such “honors,” along\nwith free travel to China and other emoluments, the Chinese Communist Party will always\nseek to exact a further price. And where that price creates divided loyalties and results in\nactions harmful to American interests and values, the US government must respond with\nappropriate legal and regulatory measures.\nNotes\n1 ​For a broad take on the issue of Chinese influence operations, see Mattis, Peter, “An American Lens on China’s\nInterference and Influence-Building Abroad.” The Asan Forum.

Ever since the Carter administration first explored the possibility\nwith Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese counterparts of sending Chinese students to\nthe United States in 1977–78, 1 PRC government authorities (like their Republican-era\npredecessors) have seen American universities as integral to China’s economic and\nscientific development. For the first two decades after normalization, the Chinese\ngovernment placed a priority on sending students in STEM subjects (Science,\nTechnology, Engineering, Mathematics). Over time, however, fields of study broadened\ninto the humanities, social sciences, and the arts, a change that has mirrored the shift\nin educational exchange from primarily a state-directed to a private consumer-driven\nphenomenon that saw an increasing number of middle-class Chinese parents opting\nto send their children to the United States for liberal arts undergraduate university,\nand even secondary school education. The net result has been that several million\nChinese students have now successfully matriculated through the US higher education\nsystem. During the 2017–2018 academic year, for instance, a record 350,755 Chinese\nstudents were enrolled in American universities (with an additional 80,000 in high\nschools), 2 out of a total of 1.5 million Chinese students studying worldwide in the\nsame year. 3 (Altogether, since the late 1970s, an estimated 5.2 million Chinese have\nattended foreign universities.) 4 Unlike the early years of this epic exchange, a majority\nof Chinese students have become able to pay full tuition, creating an extremely\nsignificant source of revenue for financially stressed American universities and colleges.\n(Chinese pay tuition worth an estimated $12 billion per year, according to the US\nDepartment of Commerce.) 5\nUS universities and American society have benefited significantly from this exchange,\nand from the presence of international students generally. Chinese students have\nhelped to diversify the makeup of US student bodies, they often contribute positively\nin the classroom, and they have made a real contribution in joint research projects\nwith university faculty. Many have remained in the United States postgraduation to\npursue professional careers, build their lives, and become American citizens—a sizable\ncontribution to American society, to the US economy, and to technological innovation\nand the knowledge base in numerous fields. The engineering, medical, and hard\nsciences have benefited particularly, but so have the humanities and social sciences.\nIndeed, those who negotiated the initial educational and scientific exchange accords\nback in 1978–1979 could never have envisioned how much of a success story US-China\nhigher educational exchanges would become over the next four decades.\n40\nFor their part, American universities and US scholars have also engaged in China during\nthis period, although in far fewer—but not insignificant—numbers. (For example, in\n2015–2016, 11,688 American students and scholars were studying in China.) 6 For those\nin the field of Chinese studies, it is de rigueur to study and do research in Chinese\nuniversities. Professional collaboration among faculty—mainly in the sciences and\nmedicine—has also flourished. Some US universities—notably Johns Hopkins School\nof Advanced International Studies (Hopkins-Nanjing Center), New York University\n(NYU-Shanghai), and Duke University (Duke-Kunshan)—have gone so far as to\nestablish campuses in China, while others have opened centers (e.g., Stanford, Virginia,\nChicago, Yale, Harvard, Columbia). Many more American universities have forged\ncollaborative exchange programs with Chinese counterparts.\nWhile US-China exchanges in higher education have primarily been a success\nstory, as in many other dimensions of the Sino-American relationship, clouds have\nappeared on the horizon. 7 American students have become less keen than in the past\nto study in China due to concerns about pollution, lack of open internet access, and\nexpanding political controls. American scholars trying to conduct research in China\nhave run into an increasing number of restrictions and impediments since 2010, due\nto a broad campaign against “foreign hostile forces” and an increasingly draconian\npolitical atmosphere that has cast a shadow across Chinese society, especially over\nhigher education. Whole subject areas and regions of the country are now off-limits\nto American and other foreign scholars for fieldwork; previously normal interactions\nwith Chinese scholars are now often heavily circumscribed; many Chinese scholars\nhave become reluctant to meet with American counterparts; a growing number of\nlibraries are off-limits; central-level archives have been closed, and provincial; municipal\narchives are increasingly restricted; interviews with government officials (at all levels)\nare more difficult to arrange; public opinion surveys must be carried out with Chinese\npartners, if they can be conducted at all; simple eyewitness social research in rural and,\neven some urban areas, is considerably more limited than previously. In short, normal\nscholarly research practices permitted elsewhere in the world are regularly proscribed\nin China. These restrictions also include the inability to hold open and uncensored\npublic scholarly discussions, conferences, and other kinds of events. Meanwhile,\nChinese students and scholars enjoy unimpeded access to all of these activities in the\nUnited States, resulting in a severe asymmetry in Sino-American scholarly exchange.\nThis contravenes the spirit of the bilateral US-China educational exchange accords.\nAt the same time, storm clouds are also gathering on American campuses with respect\nto another aspect of this important relationship, namely, growing concerns about\nunfair Chinese “influence-seeking activities” in the United States.\nUniversities\n41\nConfucius Institutes\nOne of the most controversial aspects of the whole US-China educational exchange\nis the Confucius Institutes (CI), of which there are now 110 (plus 501 Confucius\nClassrooms in secondary schools) across the United States. 8 For secondary schools and\ncolleges that have no or little other coverage of China on campus, CIs are an important\nresource. Sponsored by the Hanban, an organization directly under the Ministry of\nEducation in Beijing, but also with ties to the External Propaganda Leading Group of\nthe CCP Central Committee, the primary mission of CIs is to teach Chinese language\nand culture abroad. However, faculty and other watchdogs have warned that they may\npresent risks to intellectual freedom by using American universities as vehicles through\nwhich to advance Chinese Communist Party propaganda. Accusations leveled at CIs\nrevolve mainly around the exclusive use of PRC materials that promote PRC Chinese\nviewpoints, terminology, and simplified characters; the avoidance of discussion\non controversial topics such as Tibet, Tiananmen, Xinjiang, the Falun Gong, and\nhuman rights in American classrooms and programs; and potential infringement on\ntheoretically independent studies curricula on American campuses.\nAlthough proponents of CIs like to compare them with branches of France’s L’Alliance\nFrancaise, Germany’s Goethe Instituts, and Spain’s Cervantes Institute, they are\ndifferent in important ways. Unlike these other institutions, CIs are joint operations\nlocated inside—and co-funded by—a host university or secondary school for which\nthe Hanban arranges a Chinese university to supply teachers, textbooks, and other\nmaterials. The teachers are paid by the Chinese university (and hence do not hold\ngreen cards or pay US taxes). Typically, the Hanban provides a $150,000 start-up grant\nwith $100,000–$200,000 per year follow-on funding (depending on the institution)\ndirectly to the American university. Secondary schools normally receive $50,000 in\ninitial funding and $15,000 subsequently per annum. Most troublesome are two\nprovisions in the Hanban contracts with US host institutions: One forbids the CIs\nfrom conducting any activities that contravene Chinese law while the other requires\nthat the enabling contract remain confidential, making oversight by the academic\ncommunity difficult.\nSome participating American institutions have belatedly had second thoughts about\ntheir partnerships. In 2014, the University of Chicago terminated its CI contract\nwith the Hanban after months of controversy among faculty, spurred by a highprofile\ncritical article by an emeritus member. 9 Since that time, at least two additional\nAmerican universities have also closed their branches (Pennsylvania State University\nand University of West Florida), 10 and Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), a leading critic of\nalleged Chinese “influence activities,” has written letters to a number of other Florida\ninstitutions hosting CIs requesting that they also be closed. 11 Representatives Michael\nMcCaul (R-TX) and Henry Cuellar (D-TX) called for the same termination in their own\nSection 4\n42\nstate, stating in a letter addressed to their state’s universities that these organizations\n“are a threat to our nation’s security by serving as a platform for China’s intelligence\ncollection and political agenda.” They added that, “We have a responsibility to uphold\nour American values of free expression, and to do whatever is necessary to counter any\nbehavior that poses a threat to our democracy.” The Texas A&M system complied with\nthis request by ordering the closure of all CIs. 12 Then, in August 2018, the University\nof North Florida announced the closure of its CI. 13\nSimilar calls have been made in other states, and the 2019 National Defense\nAuthorization Act restricts Department of Defense language study funding if a\nuniversity hosts a Confucius Institute. 14 Several other universities (including Dickinson\nState University in Pennsylvania, the University of Pennsylvania, and Princeton\nUniversity) that had been contemplated opening CIs, have now decided not to do so.\nAt the same time, Columbia University (and elsewhere) has come under criticism, more\nfor lack of transparency than for its specific violative activities. 15 That said, the majority\nof CIs have so far carried out their mission of language and cultural education without\ncontroversy.\nIn 2014, both the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) and the\nAmerican Association of University Professors (AAUP) called on universities to\nterminate CIs unless their agreements with Hanban were renegotiated to provide for\ntotal transparency and compliance with norms of academic freedom. 16 In 2017, the\nNational Association of Scholars (NAS), a politically conservative nonprofit advocacy\ngroup, 17 undertook an exhaustive study of CIs in the United States and produced a\n183-page report. 18 Echoing the AAUP’s recommendations, the NAS urged closing all\nCIs on the basis of four areas of concern: a restriction of intellectual freedom; lack\nof transparency; “entanglement” (with Chinese party–controlled institutions); and\nworries about them being used for Chinese “soft power” or pro-PRC propaganda.\nIn addition to the above concerns, some have argued that the fact that CI language\nprograms exclusively use PRC textbooks with “simplified” (or mainland-style) Chinese\ncharacters biases the contribution CIs make to Chinese language instruction on\nAmerican campuses. In our view, this is not a serious problem, since students should\nlearn this vocabulary and this form of written characters, so long as the university\nalso provides the opportunity for students to learn traditional “complex” characters\n(used in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and many diaspora communities) and to learn\nnon-mainland vocabulary. A review of the entire set of Hanban textbooks used by CIs\nundertaken for this report finds they contain no overt political content. Only in one\nof six levels of textbook was there a single lesson on US-China relations, and it was a\nspeech by former president Barack Obama, in which he asserted that the United States\ndoes not seek to “contain” China. Nor have we found any evidence of interference by\nUniversities\n43\nCIs in the mainstream Chinese studies curricula on US campuses to date. (See below\nfor our recommendations concerning CIs.)\nChinese Students and Scholars Associations\nChinese Students and Scholars Associations (CSSA) on American campuses maintain\nregular contact with China’s diplomatic missions in the US. Even when these contacts\nare purely for cultural purposes, the CSSA provides a ready channel or entry point\nfor the political departments of China’s embassy and consulates in the US to gather\ninformation and coordinate action, which in some cases includes pressuring the\nbehavior of Chinese students. Sometimes pressure is even applied by China’s security\nservices on the family members of those students it finds speaking out in unacceptable\nways back in China. What is more, Chinese scholars and diplomats have sought to\ninfluence on-campus debates in China’s favors and have even protested when American\nuniversities have exercised their right to invite speakers whom China identifies as\nunfriendly. Finally, some Chinese students and scholars have exploited the collaborative\nresearch environment on US campuses to obtain sensitive American technologies.\nChinese Students and Scholars Associations now exist on approximately 150 US\ncampuses. 19 A second type of on-campus association has also recently started up,\nthe China Development Student Think Tank (CDSTT), with chapters at Syracuse\nUniversity, Boston University, and George Washington University. As voluntary\nassociations of Chinese citizens on campus, these groups perform many appropriate\nsocial functions, such as orienting new students to life in the United States and\narranging networking get-togethers. Nonetheless, their links with Chinese diplomatic\nmissions and some of their activities, because of their attempts to interfere with\nother campus activities and broader political discourse and debate, present cause for\nconcern. CSSAs at Washington, DC, universities make no secret of their ties to the\nChinese embassy and receive small amounts of operating funds directly from it. CSSAs\nelsewhere have similar ties to nearby Chinese consulates, which also provide them\nwith funding, other kinds of support, and surveillance. It has also been reported that\nChinese Communist Party cells have been established on several US campuses. 20\nCSSAs often alert PRC diplomatic missions about events on campus that offend official\nPRC political sensitivities, e.g., speeches or discussions on Tibet, Taiwan, Xinjiang, human\nrights, and Chinese elite politics. Once notified, the local PRC mission has sometimes\ncontacted university faculty or staff members to prevent such events from proceeding.\nIn some instances, it is difficult to know whether opposition to events originates with\na CSSA or the local PRC mission. In 2017, the CSSA at the University of California San\nDiego mobilized opposition to the chancellor’s invitation to the Dalai Lama to be the\ncommencement speaker, which at least some CSSA members ultimately coordinated with\nthe PRC consulate in Los Angeles. 21 After the event finally took place anyway as planned,\nSection 4\n44\nthe Chinese government retaliated by banning students and scholars with funding from\nthe Chinese government’s China Scholarship Council from attending UCSD. Other US\nuniversities have come under similar pressure when they have contemplated inviting\nthe Dalai Lama or his associates to campus. Academic authorities at one Washington,\nDC, university were even warned by the Chinese embassy that if an event concerning\nXinjiang went ahead, they risked losing their Confucius Institute.\nCSSAs also serve as a channel of political “peer monitoring” of Chinese students,\nconstraining the academic freedom of Chinese students on campus—and thereby\nalso undermining core principles of free speech and academic freedom. This issue has\nbecome more serious over the past several years, as the political environment in China\nhas tightened and Chinese students widely fear that things they say on campus (even\nin class, at other campus activities, or in private conversations) that contradict official\nPRC policies are liable to be reported to the Chinese authorities and risk putting their\nfamilies into jeopardy back home.\nA very public example of this kind took place during the commencement ceremonies\nat the University of Maryland in May 2017, after a Chinese student was selected as the\ncommencement speaker. When Yang Shuping praised the “fresh air of free speech” and\ncontrasted what she had found in the United States with China—and her comments\nwent viral on the internet and social media in China—she received an avalanche of\nemail threats, and her family in China was harassed. 22 Another well-reported incident\noccurred at Duke University in 2008 when a twenty-year-old female undergraduate\nstudent became caught up in a pro-Tibetan independence demonstration. She was\nvilified online, and her parents were harassed back in China. 23 In other cases, Chinese\ngovernment authorities have visited students’ families in China and warned them\nabout their children’s allegedly subversive statements abroad.\nIn Australia, another kind of disturbing phenomenon has occurred: Several instances\nhave occurred in which Chinese students have recorded professors’ lectures that were\ndeemed critical of the PRC and then uploaded them onto the internet, thereby\nprompting harassment of the lecturers on social media. 24 There is no evidence that this\nhas occurred on American campuses to date. But the presence on campus of a student\norganization linked to the Chinese government creates an understandable concern\nthat faculty lecturing on politically sensitive topics might fear that their lectures are\nbeing monitored and thus self-censor themselves. This prospect is especially concerning\nwhen it involves a faculty member who, because he or she needs to travel to China for\nresearch or other professional purposes, feels under duress.\nGifts and Grants\nThanks to growing wealth accumulation in China, prosperous Chinese are beginning\nto develop the practice of philanthropy and to exercise giving both at home and\nUniversities\n45\nabroad. 25 This is potentially a good thing for American universities. Indeed, since 2011,\nChinese sources have participated in at least 1,186 donations or contracts worth more\nthan $426 million to seventy-seven American universities, according to disclosures\nmade to the US Department of Education, making China the fifth most active country\nby number of gifts, and fourth, behind Qatar, England, and Saudi Arabia, in total\nmonetary value of gifts. (These disclosures are only required of universities that accept\nfederal aid, and the figures also include funds from Taiwanese sources.) 26\nAll US institutions of higher education cultivate lifetime giving from both graduates\nand their families. Given the numbers of Chinese students matriculating from\nAmerican universities and the wealth of many of their families back in China as well\nas their own potential career earnings, Chinese students have become a growing\npriority for university development officers. Indeed, some Chinese families also\nseem to believe that they can ensure, or at least enhance, their children’s chances\nof acceptance into top colleges through charitable gifts. 27\nGiven the government’s extensive role in China’s economy, acceptance of all Chinese\ngifts and grants requires due diligence that should be above and beyond the standard\npractices currently employed by universities for other charitable giving. This is\nobviously the case when funding comes from the Chinese government itself, for\nexample via the Hanban (the oversight body of the Confucius Institutes), which doles\nout research grants via its Confucius China Studies Program, 28 the “Young Sinologists”\nprogram of the Chinese Ministry of Culture and Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 29\nand, in one instance, the endowing of a faculty position at Stanford University.\nChinese corporate and private donors are now also starting to pour millions of\ndollars into the US educational system, think tanks, and nonprofit organizations.\nGiven that privately owned companies in China exist and prosper at the sufferance\nof political authorities there, even seemingly independent actors are often likely to\nact at government direction or in ways that they believe will please the government.\nMajor mainland Chinese and Hong Kong companies and individuals with active\nbusiness ventures in China have now pledged or donated substantial funds to\nUS universities.\nThis is also the case with some Hong Kong-based or US-based foundations that are\nlinked directly or indirectly to the Chinese government or to enterprises and families\nthat have prospered with the help of the Beijing government. The most notable case is\nthe China-United States Exchange Foundation. 30 CUSEF was established in 2008 on the\ninitiative of former Hong Kong chief executive and shipping magnate Tung Chee Hwa\n(C.H. Tung) who continues to be the chairman of the foundation. Tung is also the vice\nchairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China’s\nhighest-level “united front” organization 31 and he attended the Communist Party’s\n19 th Congress in October 2017. Moreover, the number of mainland-based members of\nSection 4\n46\nthe foundation’s official advisors and the foundation’s easy connections with Chinese\ngovernment organs belie the foundation’s assertion that it is independent of the\nChinese Communist Party and the PRC government.\nCUSEF undertakes a range of programs aimed at Americans that can accurately be\ndescribed as “influence-seeking activities”; as such, it has registered in the United\nStates under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA). Its lobbying activities include\nsponsoring all-expense-paid tours of China for delegations composed of what the\nfoundation’s website refers to as “thought leaders,” including journalists and editors,\nthink-tank specialists, and city and state officials. 32 CUSEF has not often collaborated\nwith American universities and think tanks, but it recently offered funding to the\nUniversity of Texas at Austin for its China Public Policy Center. However, after receiving\ncriticism from Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) and others, the university declined the grant. 33\nCUSEF grants have generally gone to leading US think tanks, such as the Brookings\nInstitution, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and the Asia Society.\nThere have not yet been many offers by Chinese donors—private, corporate, or\ngovernment—to fund faculty positions or centers for Chinese studies on US campuses,\nalthough many universities are believed to be seeking such gifts. In one instance in\n2014, a leading Washington, DC, university was approached by a Chinese university\nwith a proposal for a $500,000 annual grant to establish a Center for Chinese studies in\npartnership with the Chinese university. 34 The Chinese side had three main conditions\nfor the grant: (1) that a series of Chinese officials and other visitors would be given public\nplatforms for frequent speeches; (2) that faculty from the Chinese partner university\ncould teach China courses on the US university campus; and (3) that new Chinese\nStudies courses would be added to the university curriculum. The Washington-based\nuniversity turned down the lucrative offer, on the advice of its Chinese studies faculty.\nIn August 2017, the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International\nStudies (SAIS) announced that it had received a substantial gift from CUSEF for\nan endowed junior faculty position, as well as program funding for a “Pacific\nCommunity Initiative.” SAIS administrators stated that there were no political or\nother strings attached to these grants, despite media insinuations to the contrary. 35\nAt Yale Law School, the China Law Center founded in 1999 was renamed the Paul\nTsai China Center after receiving a $30 million endowment from Joseph C. Tsai, a\nTaiwanese Canadian billionaire who is a cofounder and executive vice chairman of the\nChina-based Alibaba Group. 36 Tsai, an alumnus of Yale College and Yale Law School,\nmade the gift in honor of his father, also an alumnus of Yale Law School.\nChina is not the only authoritarian government that has given or facilitated gifts\nto American academic institutions or think tanks, but it is the wealthiest. There\nis no evidence so far that any of these gifts has compromised the independence\nof the recipient institution. But the trend toward large gifts from Chinese sources,\nUniversities\n47\nmany with some kind of government linkage underscores the need for vigilance in\nenforcing a stricter code of due diligence and transparency on the part of university\nadministrations and faculties.\nPressure on University Administrations\nThere are a large number of successful exchange programs between American and\nChinese universities. Three US universities have developed campuses in China (Johns\nHopkins, Duke, NYU), more than one hundred universities participate in cooperativeeducation\nprograms in China, and countless US faculty members participate in\ncollaborative projects with Chinese colleagues (principally in the sciences). These\nrelationships have not been easy to establish or maintain, but they have generally\nbeen successful. A 2016 report by the Government Accounting Office, which reviewed\nthe cooperative programs of twelve American universities, found that the universities\n“generally indicated that they experienced academic freedom,” while noting that\nself- and internet censorship remains a problem.\nIn recent years, the outlook for these collaborations has deteriorated in line with\nbroader restrictions on academic freedom on Chinese campuses. In 2013, and\ncommensurate with CCP Central Committee Document No. 9, universities were\nreportedly instructed to avoid discussing topics including “universal values” and civil\nrights, 37 and admonitions against teaching of Western values have continued. Since\n2017, foreign university collaborative institutions have been required to institute\nCommunist Party committees and place a Party secretary on their management\nboards. 38 In July 2018, the Ministry of Education ended 234, or one-fifth, of its\ninternational university partnerships. More than twenty-five programs with\nAmerican universities were among them. 39\nThe Chinese government has demonstrated a penchant for turning to these\ncollaborations as points of leverage when US universities have hosted the Dalai\nLama or held other events deemed politically sensitive or offensive to the Chinese\ngovernment. In such instances, existing collaborative exchange programs have been\nsuspended or put on hold, planned visits of university administrators have been\ncanceled, programs between university institutes and centers have been suspended,\nand Chinese students wishing to study at these US institutions have been counseled\nto go elsewhere. Such punitive actions resulting from campus visits by the Dalai Lama\nhave been taken against Emory University, the University of Maryland, the University\nof California–San Diego, and others. In the case of the University of Maryland, which\nhosted the Dalai Lama in 2013, there was temporary fallout, and then following the\n2017 graduation incident the Chinese government again halted cooperation, seriously\ndamaging one of the most extensive exchange programs with China.\nSection 4\n48\nSuch cases establish a worrying precedent of Chinese intrusion into American\nacademic life. The message from China to US universities is clear: Do not transgress the\npolitical no-go zones of the Chinese Communist Party or government, or you will pay\na price. Sometimes the pressure is overt; other times it is more subtle and indirect, but\nno less alarming. Some American faculty members report troubling conversations with\nuniversity administrators who continue to view Chinese students as such a lucrative\nrevenue stream that it should not be endangered by “needlessly irritating Chinese\nauthorities.”\nCensorship and Self-Censorship\nThe final category of troubling Chinese influence on American campuses involves the\nvexing issue of self-censorship among faculty and students in Chinese studies. 40 In a\nmuch-quoted essay, Perry Link described censorship within China as the use of vague\nthreats to induce academics, writers, and others to self-limit what they say; he called\nthis “the anaconda in the chandelier” syndrome. 41 More recently, the phenomenon\nhas begun to loom over scholars working outside China, and the Chinese government\nhas started deploying a variety of techniques to also encourage self-censorship beyond\nChina’s borders, including in the United States. In some cases, this syndrome has led to\noutright self-censorship of academic work. To cite some of the most egregious examples:\n• Denial of visas to qualified scholars and students seeking access to China for\nresearch or training purposes. The State Department estimates that fifteen to\ntwenty individuals are on an outright “black list,” while scores of others appear\nto be on a “gray” list, where denials are less absolute and sometimes temporary\nor limited only to certain categories of visa. But being cast into the “gray” status\nhelps create exactly the kind of uncertainty about what behavior might lead to\nvisa denial, thus inducing self-censorship in the hopes of not offending anyone\nfurther, much less turning one’s status from “gray” to “black.” In other words,\nthe power to withhold or deny access through the issuance of visas affords the\nChinese government a full spectrum of powerful control mechanisms over\nscholars.\n• Denial of access to interviewees, archives, libraries, and research institutes, even\nwhen visas are granted.\n• Restriction of visiting scholar status for American researchers to a few institutes\nunder the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and\nsome universities. Other think tanks and research institutes do not permit foreign\nresident researchers. At the same time, it should be noted, Chinese researchers\nfrom a wide variety of institutes are free to regularly come to US universities and\nthink tanks for short- and long-term stays.\nUniversities\n49\n• Attempts to control the agendas, participant name lists, what is written, and\nwhat is said at joint scholarly conferences held in China, and now sometimes\neven in the United States. (A recent technique is to require that a talk or paper\nby an American participant in a Chinese organized event be handed over to the\norganizing group for vetting well before the event itself, so a participant can be\ndisinvited, if necessary.)\n• Restriction of internet and email communications when in China.\n• Monitoring, even following, some American scholars by security services while\nin China.\n• Demands for censorship by foreign publishers of their digital content as a\ncondition for allowing it to be made available online in China.\n• Insistence on censorship of Chinese-language editions of foreign books by the\nState Press & Publishing Administration. This places foreign authors in the\ndifficult position of having to acquiesce to such censorship in order to have\ntranslations of their books published in China.\n• Censorship of online archives of PRC journals and publications, such as\nthe China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database. American\nuniversities each pay tens of thousands of dollars annually for access to these\nelectronic databases. However, recent research has shown that CNKI in particular\nis now “curating” its catalogs and holdings by deleting articles the current\ngovernment appears not to wish to see remaining in the historical record. 42 Since\nAmerican universities have started to dispose of paper copies of many of the\njournals carried in CNKI (China National Knowledge Information) periodical\nindex, this amounts to PRC distorting the historical record, not just for China\nbut for the entire world.\nIn addition to these specific restrictions affecting American scholars, the PRC\ngovernment also influences the field of Chinese studies in the United States (and\nelsewhere) via controls over key regions of their country (especially minority areas\nsuch as Tibet and Xinjiang) and by putting no-go zones around a wide variety of\nresearch subjects within the broader areas of politics, religion, ethnography, and civil\nsociety that cannot be researched in-country. As a result, American professors cannot\nthemselves work in these areas, nor can they in good conscience advise their graduate\nstudents to work on these subjects either because of risk to the researcher’s career, as\nwell as to the human subjects whom researchers would be observing or interviewing.\nSuch restrictions have real consequences for the open future of Chinese studies around\nthe world.\nSection 4\n50\nConclusion and Recommendations\nUS-China academic exchanges are valuable to both China and the United States and\nshould be maintained and developed. However, in doing so, universities must be alert\nto the risks of engaging with the Chinese government, institutions, and funders and\nbe proactive in applying a higher level of due diligence and vigilance as a defense of\nthe core principle of academic freedom, especially when conflicts take place at home\nin their own universities.\nPromote Transparency\nConfucius Institutes We do not endorse calls for Confucius Institutes to be closed,\nas long as several conditions are met. US institutions should make their CI agreements\npublic to facilitate oversight by members of the university community and other\nconcerned parties. Those agreements, in turn, must grant full managerial authority\nto the host institution (not on a shared basis with the Hanban), so the university has\nfull control over what a CI teaches, the activities it undertakes, the research grants it\nmakes, and whom it employs. The clause in all Hanban contracts that CIs must operate\n“according to China’s laws” must be deleted.\nIf these standards cannot be attained, then the CI agreements should be terminated.\nFurthermore, universities should prevent any intervention by CIs in curricular\nrequirements and course content in their overall Chinese studies curricula or other\nareas of study by maintaining a clear administrative separation between academic\ncenters and departments on the one hand, and CIs on the other. Finally, universities\nmust ensure that all public programming offered by their CIs conform to academic\nstandards of balance and diversity and do not cross the line to become a platform\nfor PRC propaganda, or even a circumscribed view of a controversial issue. In fact,\nthis report would suggest that universities not permit Confucius Institutes to become\ninvolved in public programming that goes beyond the CI core mission of education\nabout Chinese language and culture. To go beyond these two categories invites\nopportunities for politicized propaganda.\nApply Due Diligence To minimize the risks just identified, universities must rigorously\napply far stricter due-diligence procedures to scrutinize the sources and purposes of\ngifts and contracts from China to ensure that they do not interfere with academic\nfreedom. Universities accepting gifts from Chinese nationals, corporations, or\nfoundations must insist that there be no restrictions on academic freedom. Foreign\ndonations should continue to be welcomed, but universities must ensure that the\nconditions of acceptance are reasonable, consonant with their principles, subject to\noversight, and do not allow the program to become a beachhead for inappropriate\ninfluence. It is important that all universities exercise high standards of due diligence\nand not only scrutinize the source of the gift but consider the implications of such\nUniversities\n51\nthings as naming rights. Above all, they must insist that the terms of each gift\nimpose no restrictions on academic freedom. The activities of all chairs, centers,\nand projects funded by Chinese support need to be fully transparent and supervised\nby independent faculty committees and university administrators, who must bear\nin mind that even when a joint project, research grant, or gift has undergone due\ndiligence and has no explicit or evident strings attached, it can still produce a natural\nsense of obligation because no institution wants to offend a generous donor. This is a\nproblem, not restricted to grants from China, but one that is deeply entrenched in the\nfund-raising structure on which American institutions of higher education depend for\ntheir well-being.\nDefend Academic Freedom Faculty governance is the core technique for protecting\nacademic freedom in American universities and is the key to their leading role in\nresearch and teaching. It takes various forms in various institutions, but its key\nprinciples must be applied consistently to interactions involving China. Transparency\nmust be maintained in the terms of a university’s contracts with all outside actors,\nwhether individuals, foundations, donors, or collaborating institutions such as the\nHanban, which funds Confucius Institutes. Such actors must be subject to regular\noversight by faculty bodies and by administrators answerable to faculty bodies so that\nfaculty, students, visiting scholars, and others associated with the university in an\nacademic capacity will have uncompromised freedom of speech, research, teaching,\nand programmatic activities.\nUniversities and their associated institutions—such as university presses—must\nrefuse all forms of censorship of—or interference in—their publications, conferences,\ncurricula, participants in events, and other academic activities. Some universities have\nformal rules barring such censorship, but they need to increase awareness, training,\nand enforcement. Other universities may need to enact or update such rules. While\nmaintaining the openness of US universities to Chinese students, scholars, and\nresearchers, universities should push for reciprocity from Chinese partner institutions\nwith respect to various forms of research access.\nIn short, universities should enhance protection for faculty and students—especially\ninternational students—from interference in their academic freedom, and campuses\nwith large numbers of international students from authoritarian countries should\nintroduce training for students on their academic rights in the American educational\nsystem, and on the proper distance that independent student organizations should\nmaintain from government actors. Finally, universities should provide a confidential\ncomplaint procedure for students who feel they have come under pressure that\nthreatens their academic freedom, and university advisors should stand prepared to\ncounsel and assist these students to deal appropriately with such pressures.\nSection 4\n52\nPromote Integrity\nBe Alert to Risks The primary risk is of inappropriate influence over admissions,\ncourse content, and program activities stemming from the influence of Chinese\ngovernment-linked donors, diplomatic missions, student groups, and institutions.\nThis is not a new challenge for US university administrators and development officers.\nThey have dealt with political quid pro quos from donors from South Korea, Taiwan,\nJapan, Israel, Russia, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and other countries in the past and\ncurrently, and American universities have long learned how to refuse donations with\nstrings attached. This historical experience and the existing safeguards should also\nhelp inform and guide US universities when it comes to dealing with this new wave of\nChinese money. Faculty and administrators must continue to protect the open debate,\ndiversity of opinion, freedom of expression, faculty autonomy, and transparency on\nwhich the health and reputation of their institutions are based. Funding from Chinese\nsources should be as welcome as funding from other sources, but only to the extent\nthat fundamental academic values can be maintained and protected.\nA second risk is a loss of sensitive or proprietary technology through academic\ninstruction of cooperation. There are indications that the US government is now\nstrengthening measures to protect the theft of sensitive technology and intellectual\nproperty that is being developed on US campuses. These measures may require\nheightened screening and, in some cases, outright denial of visas to individuals from\ncertain state-run institutions or even from certain sensitive research fields. Such\ncalls have understandably prompted concern from the academic community fearing\nthat this will undermine the principles of academic freedom, hinder collaboration,\nand deny American universities access to a rich talent pool. These reservations are\nmerited and require that any tightening of visa categories be as narrow as possible.\nFor their part, universities will of course have to comply with whatever regulations are\nimposed. They should, additionally, proactively review and update their procedures\nfor protecting both proprietary and classified research. They should also enter into\nfar closer collegial discussions with one another, relevant professional associations,\nand government agencies to collectively refine solutions to the difficult problem of\nbalancing the pursuit of innovation and academic freedom with preventing the theft\nof technology and other IP.\nTo meet these challenges, American universities may need to update their rules and\nintensify faculty and researcher training and institutional oversight for protection of\nproprietary research information. Some US universities refuse to accept contracts for\nclassified research. Those that do accept such contracts must comply with government\nregulations for the protection of research findings. But all research universities\nconduct research that produces valuable intellectual property, which is proprietary\nin various proportions to the funder. And so, it is necessary for the university and\nUniversities\n53\nresearchers to intensify efforts to protect their proprietary intellectual property\nfrom loss.\nPromote Reciprocity\nThe academic community nationwide should work toward a common set of principles\nand practices for protecting academic freedom and promote greater reciprocity.\nTo prevent influencers from using divide-and-conquer strategies (by rewarding\nsome institutions while punishing others), it is important for the national academic\ncommunity as a whole to come together to formulate and implement these principles.\nUS universities should not only work together but they should also work with other\nuniversities around the world to develop a “Code of Conduct” for acceptable and\nunacceptable practices in academic exchanges with Chinese institutions and funders.\n(The section on think tanks in this section recommends similar measures.) The\nacademic community and government should also monitor instances where Chinese\nentities may acquire financially challenged American colleges outright, ensuring that\ntheir academic integrity is not compromised. 43\nUniversities can and must continue to play a positive role in the US-China relationship.\nIndeed, by introducing international students to American life and values, and\nconnecting them to new personal and professional relationships, universities are\narguably the important means by which the United States exercises its soft power.\nGenerally—but not always—individuals undergoing such an experience take a more\npositive view of the country. Unfortunately, as Chinese students contribute much, not\nleast monetarily, to American universities, universities have been too slow to help them\nintegrate themselves more organically into campus life. As a result, Chinese students\nreport unacceptably high levels of depression and isolation or simply clubbing up with\neach other. 44 While acting to mitigate the risks of improper interference, universities\nmust not forget their obligations to these students nor lose sight of the far greater\nopportunity to advance cooperation and understanding.\nNOTES\n1 ​This process is well documented in Li, Cheng (ed.).

For this reason, they are high-value targets for\nlobbying and influence activities by foreign governments and nongovernmental actors,\nincluding those from the People’s Republic of China.\nThink tanks in the United States date to the early twentieth century, when industrial\ncapital and private philanthropy (led by the likes of Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller,\nAndrew W. Mellon, and Henry Ford) began to endow private nonprofit research\ninstitutions at a time when there was increasing government demand for expertise on\na growing range of public policy issues. Over the past century, think tanks have come\nto play ever more vital roles in the American public policy process, and they contribute\nboth directly and indirectly to public education, a richer public dialogue via the\nmedia, greater civic engagement, and better-informed government policy formulation.\nOf the approximately 1,800 think tanks in the United States today, about half are\nresearch institutions located within US universities. For the purpose of this section,\nhowever, only those think tanks located in nonuniversity private sector settings are\nconsidered. Most of these think tanks and research institutions enjoy tax-exempt\nstatus under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, which stipulates that\nthey are restricted from legislative lobbying as “action organizations.” Institutions that\nreceive this tax-exempt status must either be charitable philanthropic organizations or\nresearch organizations (think thanks) that operate in a supposedly nonpartisan way\nand in the general public interest. Because they are largely privately funded through\ndonor contributions, US think tanks compete tenaciously for support, professional\nexpertise, and public impact.\nRoles of Think Tanks in American Society\nThe universe of think tanks in the United States is very diverse, and each think tank\nperforms different missions for different audiences and clients through different means\nof output. Four roles are especially relevant to discussions of Chinese interest and\npotential influence seeking.\nThe first and most important role is educating the public and better informing the\n“policy community.” The majority of mainstream think tanks consciously perform\nthese functions through a variety of mechanisms: publishing books, articles in\n58\njournals, shorter “policy briefs,” or “op-eds,” and by contributing to policy “task\nforce” reports on specific issues; holding public seminars, briefings, and conferences;\nspeaking to the print, television, radio, and electronic media; and maintaining\ninformational websites that disseminate publications of the think-tank videos of\nevents on a worldwide basis.\nThe second role is to influence government policy. This is done through face-toface\nmeetings with government officials, providing testimony before congressional\ncommittees, track-two discussions, emails and other communications aimed at\ntargeted audiences, and a wide variety of publications.\nThe third role, undertaken by some, but not all, US policy think tanks, is to provide\nspecific research on a contractual basis for government agencies that is generally not\nfor public consumption.\nThe fourth role is to provide personnel to go into government service for fixed periods\nof time through the famous American “revolving door,” whereby think tanks become\n“governments in waiting” for ex- and would-be officials until just after an election,\nwhen there is usually a large-scale turnover of personnel in Washington as each new\nadministration is formed.\nIn American think tanks, selection of general research topics can be influenced by\noutside sources (management, external funding agencies, or government policy\nshifts). But the final selection is usually subject to mutual agreement, and the findings\nof research are not supposed to be dictated by outside pressures. At the same time,\nboth US think tanks and university research institutes are expected to maintain\nanalytical independence from their funders. If the funding body does seek to interfere\nwith a research project or promote its own agenda, there is an established expectation\nthat its funding should be rejected. More often than not, there is a process of\nmutual consultation between researcher, think tank, and potential external\nfunding bodies—through which interests are de-conflicted and grants are negotiated\nto the mutual satisfaction of all parties. While this is the optimal scenario, there have\nbeen cases revealed in the US media in recent years in which such principles were\nabridged.\nThe Role of China in American Think Tanks\nIt is against this general backdrop that the role of expanding Chinese influence on\nAmerican think tanks needs to be considered. What follows are the findings gleaned\nthrough interviews with seventeen think-tank analysts from eleven Washington- and\nNew York–based think tanks 1 that explore the nature of interactions that US think-tank\nspecialists have recently been having with Chinese counterparts. The analysts are all\nThink Tanks\n59\nrecognized China experts (with the exception of one who is more broadly an Asia\nexpert but has extensive experience with China-related projects) who have served as\ndirectors of programs or centers in their respective institutions. About half have served\nin the US government. One directs a think tank that is partially supported by Chinese\ngovernment funds. The interviews were all conducted in 2018.\nChina has become a priority field for US think tanks concerned with international\nrelations, and most now have staff members (often several) devoted to researching and\npublishing on China. Many possess PhD degrees, Chinese language skills, and have\nlived in or visited China over many years with some originally from the PRC. Some\nstay on staff for many years, while others work on short-term (two- or three‐year)\ncontracts. Most think tanks also employ student research assistants and interns\n(including those from China).\nThere is significant interaction between American and Chinese think tanks—as\nthink-tank researchers need to visit China as well as host and receive visitors in the United\nStates to be well informed and to perform their own research work. Most interviewees\nreported hosting or participating in ad hoc meetings in their home institutions with\nvisiting Chinese officials or scholars on a regular basis; although two do not host any\nmeetings with Chinese, they will attend such events if hosted by others. All but one\nof the interviewees travel to China for their work: to deliver lectures, to participate in\nconferences or Track 1.5 or Track 2 dialogues, and to do research for articles, books,\nand reports.\nA number of scholars noted a marked shift in the nature of their interactions with\nChinese colleagues and research projects over the past few years. While longstanding\nTrack 2 dialogues continue on issues such as cyber policy, nuclear policy,\nand US-China interactions in third countries and regions, overall they seem not as\nopen, robust, and productive as in the past. Indeed, several long-standing Track 2\ndialogues have been curtailed or stopped altogether—with scholars reporting that\nit is increasingly difficult to establish sustained dialogues that are meaningful with\nChinese think tanks because of new rules, restrictions, and uncertainties. For instance,\nChinese institutions (both think tanks and universities) must now obtain central-level\ngovernment approval, such as vetting dialogue topics and foreign participants, before\nbeing able to host foreign participants in China. New Chinese government regulations\ngenerally limit Chinese think-tank scholars and university professors to one foreign\ntrip per year, and even go so far as to hold passports to make even personal travel more\ndifficult.\nWhen dialogues do occur, another noticeable recent trend has been a decline in\ncandor and greater uniformity in what Chinese interlocutors say. One US think tanker\nnoted, “The conversations have declined in productivity,” while another commented\nSection 5\n60\nthat he had “moved away from Track 2 because China does not have much to say\nbeyond the Xi Catechism. Even in private conversations, we are not getting anything\ninteresting.” And yet another indicated that he no longer participates in many joint\nevents because they need to be “framed in a way to fit the Chinese narrative, including\nthe speakers, agenda, topics and writing.” Achieving true candor in such dialogues\nwith the Chinese side has long been difficult, as Chinese interlocutors routinely stick\nto “talking points” and stock slogans, stay strictly “on message,” and are afraid to say\nanything in front of their peers that might subsequently get them in political trouble\nback home.\nOne US analyst commented that at a recent conference in Beijing, Chinese scholars\ndemonstrated little interest in putting forth ideas for cooperation, a marked change\nfrom earlier meetings. This individual believes that tensions in the US-China\nrelationship are at least partially responsible. And it is not only the Americans who\nsee less utility in such dialogues. One Track 2 initiated by the Chinese side concerning\nglobal norm cooperation ended abruptly when the Chinese said they did not see any\nproductive benefits, despite the willingness of the US side to move forward with the\nproject.\nWhile these are long-standing problems, they have gotten demonstratively worse\nduring the Xi Jinping era. As one think tank scholar commented, “Collaboration\nhas become much more difficult, more authoritarian, and finding a common\ndefinition of a program is more difficult. We could usually find areas on which to\nwork collaboratively, but there is a gap in worldview.” One US think tank analyst who\ndirects an innovative program to foster dialogue among rising American and Chinese\nstrategic thinkers, which used to be hosted alternately in both China and the United\nStates, has moved the program entirely out of China because of the repressive political\natmosphere. Another institution has transitioned away from cooperative projects with\nChina to emphasize bolstering the capacity of other countries in their dealings with\nChina.\nMany US think tank scholars have also become concerned that the relationship\nbetween Chinese and American scholars has regressed into a one-way street—with\nAmericans providing intelligence to Chinese interlocutors, whose main purpose is to\ntake the information back to their government. Indeed, some Chinese interlocutors\narrive in the offices of American think tanks with barely disguised “shopping lists”\nof questions, which are presumably set by government “taskers” in Beijing. This is\na regular occurrence, but it tends to spike when a high-level governmental visit or\nsummit meeting is pending. A related Chinese goal is to transmit Chinese government\npolicy perspectives to American think-tank counterparts.\nThink Tanks\n61\nSince 2010, American (and other foreign) researchers have encountered a\nprogressively more restrictive research environment in China. One American scholar\nnoted that a previous research project that involved on-the-ground interviews\nacross many provinces was no longer possible. The registration and information\nrequirements of the 2017 Law on the Management of Foreign NGOs is part of the\nproblem, she believes, by severely constraining opportunities to conduct joint\nprojects and research in China. It has also become exceedingly difficult to arrange\ninterviews with Chinese think-tank scholars and government officials; many\ninstitutional libraries are now off-limits; central-level archives are inaccessible\nwith provincial and local ones also increasingly circumscribed; survey research is\nimpossible (unless in partnership with an approved Chinese counterpart, which is\nincreasingly hard to find); and other bureaucratic impediments make it increasingly\ndifficult for foreign think-tank researchers to undertake their basic jobs of\nresearching China. At the same time, Chinese researchers working in the US are able\nto schedule appointments easily with their American counterparts and government\nofficials, enjoy open access to American libraries and government archives, are able\nto conduct surveys anywhere, and may travel freely around the United States to do\nfield work.\nUS Think-Tank Centers in China\nOnly two American think tanks operate real satellite centers in Beijing, and one does\nso in Hong Kong. Both Beijing centers are cohosted by, and located on, the campus\nof Tsinghua University. One has a robust program of research by Chinese fellows,\nbrings in people from the think tank’s other centers, has a young ambassador program\nfor Americans and Chinese, and boasts a “wide open internet.” One center uses its\nfacilities primarily for presentations from the resident fellows and other visitors. Some\ntalks are open to the public, but most are restricted to faculty and graduate students.\nThe center’s ambitions were originally greater: for example, to host a set of annual\nconferences with senior experts and officials on both sides. However, the Chinese side\ncould not live up to its side of the bargain, demanding that senior US officials attend\nwhile not delivering Chinese officials of equivalent rank.\nThese two centers have also become caught up within the increasingly strained\nUS-China relationship as well as the tightening political atmosphere inside China.\nAccording to one affiliated research fellow, “connections with the center are a liability\nbecause institutions and people can cause you problems if you don’t say the right\nthings.” At least one of the centers in Greater China has occasionally limited its public\nprogramming from addressing sensitive political issues, because it did not want to\njeopardize the institution’s presence in China and Asia. Yet that think tank’s other\nstaffers and fellows have also proved adept at circumventing political restrictions by,\nSection 5\n62\nin one instance, inviting a well-known Hong Kong activist denied access at one center\nevent to participate in an event at the US headquarters later.\nChinese Outreach to US Think Tanks\nChinese outreach to American think tanks takes several forms, including via embassy\nand consular officials, Chinese think-tank scholars, and representatives of China’s\nstate-run media.\nEmbassy and Consular Officials\nChinese embassy and consular officials meet frequently with many (but not all) of\nthe interviewees. Sometimes their aim is to assess Americans’ views on particular\nissues or offer feedback on particular articles (generally those that are critical of\nChina). In one case, for example, a Chinese official stated that a particular analyst’s\nunderstanding was “too gloomy,” and in another that a scholar “didn’t have the\ncorrect data.” One think-tank scholar noted that Chinese officials use both threats\nand praise to try to influence her. On the one hand, they took her to lunch and\nexpressed “concern with her mind set” indicating that she just “just do[es] not\nunderstand the situation.” But embassy and Chinese government officials can also be\neffusive in their praise and offers of assistance, suggesting that she “knows too much\nabout Chinese policy.”\nOftentimes officials ask for meetings with think tankers to transmit messages after\nimportant Communist Party or government events. After the annual meeting of\nChina’s legislature (the National People’s Congress) in 2018, for example, one thinktank\nanalyst was invited to lunch, only to endure an hour-and-a-half lecture on how\nUS media and analysts misunderstood the new change in presidential term limits and\nXi’s reform efforts. Another was visited by military attachés from the Chinese embassy\nin an effort to convey China’s opposition to the Taiwan Travel Act, US Defense\nAuthorization Act, possible prospects for US Navy ship visits, and submarine sales to\nTaiwan. In concluding his stern warnings, one attaché warned: “We are no longer\nweak, and can inflict pain on Taiwan, if the United States is not careful and does not\nabide by the Three Communiques.”\nOn other occasions, Chinese embassy officials ask for meetings to warn think tanks\nagainst hosting speakers on topics often related to Taiwan, Hong Kong, or Tibet.\nSeveral think-tank analysts reported that they or others in their institutions had\nreceived calls from senior Chinese embassy officials regarding projects related to the\nDalai Lama, in one case stating, “This is very troubling—it will have consequences.”\nAs far as the analysts were concerned, however, there turned out to be no consequences.\nAnother received a complaint from the Chinese embassy after the think tank hosted\nThink Tanks\n63\na delegation from Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)—but again there were\nno discernible consequences. In a separate case, a senior Chinese Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs official warned that a particular interactive website focusing on Chinese\nsecurity issues was “anti-China.” In response, the think tank invited contributions by\na prominent Chinese think-tank scholar: “The content of the website didn’t change,\nbut the official didn’t complain again.” In another instance, the Chinese government\nwithdrew an offer to a US think tank to host Foreign Minister Wang Yi after that think\ntank refused to disinvite a Taiwanese speaker for a separate event.\nChinese officials have also requested that US think tanks bar certain scholars or\nNGO activists from participating in discussions with senior Chinese officials. When\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke at one high-profile Washington think tank,\nthe embassy requested the guest list in advance and then demanded that several\nindividuals—including at least one senior China scholar—be disinvited. The think\ntank refused. In yet another case involving the director of the National People’s\nCongress Foreign Affairs Committee, Fu Ying, a US think tank was strongly advised\nto exclude a well-known China specialist as a condition for a meeting going forward.\nThink-tank analysts report that in most cases, but not all, such requests have been\nrejected and events continue as planned.\nGenerally speaking, PRC visitors either steer clear of or limit their contact with think\ntanks that have strong relations with, or extensive funding from, Taiwan. One analyst\nwho writes extensively on Taiwan and PRC-Taiwan relations finds that Chinese\nofficials typically do not engage with him. At one time, there was a conflict between\nan event that he was hosting for a Taiwanese official with a significant event that same\nafternoon hosted by a colleague that featured very prominent Chinese and American\nofficials. The Chinese embassy instructed them to move the Taiwan event, but they\nrefused. Both events took place with no apparent negative repercussions.\nThink Tank to Think Tank\nAs noted above, Chinese officials and think-tank counterparts reach out to American\nthink-tank China specialists for the purposes of information/intelligence collection\nand influencing US policy debates. One Chinese scholar reported to an American\nthink-tank analyst that that every time an American expert meets with a Chinese\ninterlocutor, a report is written afterward. Another Chinese visitor indicated to\na leading Washington think-tank expert that China’s Foreign Ministry has staff\ndedicated to tracking the activities and publications of about twenty leading\nAmerican-China specialists.\nAny number of Chinese think tanks sponsor meetings and conferences in China\nand the United States with American counterparts. In some instances, the Chinese\nSection 5\n64\npartners are well-known government entities. The Chinese Institute of Contemporary\nInternational Relations and the University of International Relations, both of which\nhave links to the Ministry of State Security (MSS), host conferences on US-China\nrelations and/or Track 2 dialogues. So do the Foreign Ministry–affiliated China\nInstitute of International Studies, Chinese People’s Institute for Foreign Affairs,\nand the China Foreign Affairs University. The Charhar Institute is also involved\nin such activities, although its institutional linkages are unclear.\nMore recently, Chinese think tanks professing to be independent from direct\ngovernment control have begun to actively engage US counterparts. The think-tank\nIntellisia is one such organization that has sponsored dialogues with US scholars. The\nCenter for China and Globalization is another such “independent” think tank, with\nmore than a hundred researchers and staff. According to several think-tank analysts,\nits founder and head, Wang Huiyao, actively solicits invitations to speak in US thinktank\nsettings. In May 2018, however, Senator Marco Rubio publicly questioned why\nWang’s CCP affiliations—most particularly his work with the CCP’s United Front Work\nDepartment as a standing director of the China Overseas Friendship Association—\nwere not mentioned as part of his biography in an invitation to an upcoming event at\na DC-based think tank. Despite the fact that the think tank planned to acknowledge\nWang’s position during the panel presentation, given the ensuing public scrutiny,\nWang dropped out of the event. He later appeared, however, at another US think-tank\nevent without his government affiliation noted and without provoking attention from\nany member of Congress. For such “independent” Chinese think tanks, organizing\nconferences can give them a significant boost in prestige at home. One Chinese\nthink-tank director informed an American think-tank analyst that he received several\nhundred thousand dollars from the university’s party secretary as a bonus for bringing\nsuch a prestigious delegation of Western China watchers to China.\nFinally, a group of several senior Chinese government officials and think-tank scholars\nfrom different institutions has emerged as an important generator of China-US think\ntank cooperation. This group includes such well-known figures as Fu Ying (director of\nthe NPC’s Foreign Affairs Committee), Wang Jisi (director of Peking University’s Institute\nof International and Strategic Studies), Yuan Peng (president of CICIR), and Wang Wen\n(executive dean of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University),\nwho are all well funded and able to pay for the activities of the Chinese side, as well as\ntravel and hotel stays for Americans who participate in their projects in China.\nFu Ying emerges as the senior figure in a growing number of US-China interactions.\nAccording to several think-tank analysts, she works hard to structure projects in ways\nto ensure the best possible outcome from the Chinese perspective. This includes,\nfor example, partnering primarily—although not solely—with scholars who are\nThink Tanks\n65\nconsidered to be more favorably disposed to the Chinese government perspective\nand ensuring that those with challenging views are excluded. One analyst noted that\nformer Hong Kong chief executive C.H. Tung’s and Fu’s relationships with US thinktank\nscholars and presidents provide them with frequent opportunities to speak before\nlarge public audiences at prestigious American venues and to advance an official\nChinese narrative while gaining a certain added legitimacy at home.\nFu is also explicit in her desire to cultivate relations with think-tank experts she\nbelieves may enter government. Following the election of Donald Trump, she “rushed\nin to see” one think-tank analyst with ties to the new administration and a flurry of\nembassy officials followed. However, when it became evident that said analyst would\nnot be going into the administration, there was no more interest. In addition, at a\nmeeting around a project on US-China relations advanced by Fu, she noted that she\nhoped some of the people would be entering the government; otherwise it would not\nprove to have been worth much to have done the project.\nChinese president Xi Jinping has also encouraged Chinese think tanks to “go\nglobal”—establishing a presence within the United States and other countries as\na way “to advance the Chinese narrative.” In 2015, the Institute for China-America\nStudies (ICAS) set up shop in Washington, DC, as a 501(3)(c) nonprofit organization.\nICAS is funded by the Hainan-Nanhai Research Foundation, which receives its\nseed funding from the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, a Chinese\ngovernment–supported entity, as well as from the China Institute of the University of\nAlberta, Nanjing University, and Wuhan University. The head of ICAS, Hong Nong,\nretains ties to these institutions. ICAS maintains a small staff of researchers as well\nas a diverse board of international experts from China, the United States, Canada,\nAustralia, and Indonesia. ICAS projects focus on the central issues of the US-China\nrelationship, including US-China cooperation, maritime security, North Korea, and\ntrade relations. Hong herself focuses on the South China Sea and the Arctic policies\nof non–Arctic Council member countries, of which China is the largest and most\nsignificant. The institute also holds an annual conference.\nWhile President Xi’s call to establish think tanks was contemporaneous with the\nestablishment of ICAS, Hong has made it clear that the decision to set up ICAS in DC\ncame as a result of an effort by her and some of her colleagues both in China and in\nCanada to understand better how American think tanks operate. She was asked to\nlead ICAS, and she then selected a board of directors, as well as advisory members.\nShe views the mission of the think tank as being to serve as a bridge in perception\nbetween the United States and China. Hong does not want people to view the institute\nas advancing a Chinese government perspective or as wearing a “Chinese hat,” but\nshe believes that in DC there are too few voices that reflect a Chinese (not necessarily\nSection 5\n66\ngovernment) perspective. While she acknowledges that there is not much diversity in\nthe nature of the views represented by ICAS—there is no overt criticism of Chinese\ngovernment policies—she is hopeful that once ICAS gains greater standing, it will be\nable to attract senior scholars from other institutions with a greater range of views to\nwrite for its website.\nMore recently, Chinese publishing entrepreneur Zhou Zhixing has established the\nUS-China New Perspectives Foundation, with offices in both Los Angeles and\nWashington, DC. As of yet, these offices have no track record of activities or publications.\nIt is likely that more such think tanks initiated with or without formal Chinese\ngovernment support will follow in the United States.\nThink-Tank Funding\nDifferent US think tanks have different funding models. At least one type (Federally\nFunded Research and Development Centers, or FFRDCs) is funded entirely by the\nUS government, while several others accept some US government funding, as well\nas money from other governments on a contracted work basis. Three think tanks\ninterviewed accept no US or other government funding: One is funded entirely\nby central operating funds from an endowment, while two others rely on a mix\nof foundation and private support. One think tank’s work is funded entirely by\nfoundations. Most interviewees allow Chinese funders to pay for travel and meeting\ncosts to Beijing for conferences, while a few categorically do not—either because of\nregulations or on the principle of conflict of interest.\nAt least one think tank differentiates between funding that is dedicated to its work\nin Washington and that which supports its center in China. For the center in China,\na US-based scholar has raised funds from the China Development Bank, Huawei\nCorporation, and private entrepreneurs from Hong Kong. This same think tank has a\n“China Council” of donors (including Chinese Americans, but no Chinese nationals)\nthat supports the think tank’s activities. Some US institutions refuse to accept funds\nfrom China-based commercial entities, although they are occasionally willing to\naccept donations from their US-based subsidiaries. Other think tanks, however, accept\nfunds from Chinese corporations and individual businesspeople. One has taken money\nfrom Alibaba America for a particular event celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of\nWTO accession; another has taken money from the Chinese real estate firm Vanke for\na project on the environment. A Chinese businessman, Fu Chen, supports work at one\nChina center that also has several prominent Chinese businesspersons on its board.\nOne has an advisory council with Chinese Americans, and yet another think tank\nis building an advisory council that will include Chinese, but only those who have\nbecome American citizens. (This analyst is also considering accepting private Chinese\nmoney but not money from Chinese state-owned enterprises.)\nThink Tanks\n67\nC.H. Tung and his China-US Exchange Foundation (CUSEF) have emerged as a\nleading funding source for several think tanks, providing financial assistance for a\nvariety of projects ranging from supporting book research and writing, to funding\ncollaborative projects, to promoting exchanges. CUSEF’s work in this area extends back\nto the mid-1990s (for more on CUSEF, see the section on universities in this report).\nThe interviewees differ, however, in their assessments of whether CUSEF funding\nreflects direct linkages with Beijing. As one analyst noted, “C.H. is a special figure\nbecause he is half Hong Kong and half PRC.” Another commented that he currently\nhas the potential to undertake a joint project with C.H. Tung and will “probably do\nit for the money and the contact.” Another has accepted funds for work on cultural\nexchange and climate change, while yet another is far more circumspect, describing\nMr. Tung as an “open united front agent” in his capacity as vice chair of the Chinese\nPeople’s Political Consultative Congress. Many of the partnerships CUSEF establishes in\nconjunction with US think tanks represent efforts to find common ground, particularly\nin line with PRC initiatives and policies, for example: “The New Model of Major Power\nRelationship Research Project 2014,” “Taiwan Arms Sales Research Project 2014,” and\nthe “Pacific Community Initiative.”\nCUSEF also funds a number of annual exchange programs, including for members of\nCongress, state and local officials, historically black colleges and universities, as well as\nseveral journalist delegations, including one for students of journalism. CUSEF often\npartners with the Center for American Progress, the American Foreign Policy Council,\nand the East-West Institute. However, each partnership is different. The Center for\nAmerican Progress, for example, pays its own way in its work with CUSEF. CUSEF also\nfunds projects with think-tank analysts who are not China scholars, such as a project\non US-China relations in the Arctic. One think-tank analyst who was involved in the\nCUSEF-funded “Creating a Pacific Community” project became uncomfortable with\nthe overall orientation of the project and dropped out.\nC.H. Tung is personally proactive, often visiting the United States and meeting with\nthink-tank experts. On one occasion, he encouraged an American scholar to write an\narticle together with a noted Chinese scholar on the South China Sea. He also offered\nto establish a massive program with one institute in which the think tank would train\nChinese Party School officials on free market economics (the idea was eventually\nrejected by the think tank). In addition, CUSEF has funded the publication of at least\ntwo books in which US analysts were involved. In both cases, the analysts state that\nC.H. was “hands-off” in the process. Yet, in another instance, when a US scholar\napproached the CUSEF for possible funding of a major book on US-China relations,\nthe foundation insisted on two conditions: that half of the contributors be Chinese\nscholars, and that the foundation would have the right to review the manuscript prior\nto publication. The American scholar in question refused these conditions and looked\nelsewhere for support.\nSection 5\n68\nTaiwan’s TECRO also supports work at several think tanks. In rare cases—because one\nusually excludes the other—US think tanks end up accepting funds from both Taiwan\nand mainland China sources.\nVisa Access\nMost American scholars consider travel to China an important element of their ability\nto do their job—attending conferences, participating in delegations, and undertaking\nindependent research. Given this imperative, the issue of visa access is a central one.\nWhile most analysts receive single-entry professional exchange (F) visas, a few\nroutinely receive one-year multiple-entry F visas, while some have ten-year tourist (L)\nvisas. Others receive double-entry visas, if proof of specific invitations are produced.\nOne US think-tank scholar, a Chinese national, travels to China on a Chinese passport.\nWhile ten-year multiple-entry tourist visas are, of course, optimal—there is also a serious\npotential downside: namely, that they are for “tourism,” and, according to Chinese\nlaw, professional activities are not permitted. One senior scholar who holds a ten-year\ntourist visa was recently visited and interrogated at his hotel in Beijing after several\ndays of meetings with Chinese think tanks and universities.\nSeveral think-tank analysts expressed the opinion that Chinese officials are now paying\nmore attention to the writings of American think-tank analysts—not only books,\narticles, and op-eds, but also social media. This is done not only to become familiar\nwith changing views but to catalog who is supportive and who is critical of China’s\npolicies. One scholar believes that, as a result of a comment posted on Twitter, this\nindividual was required to go to the Chinese embassy for an interview before being\ngranted a visa. This had never happened in his previous decades of China-related travel.\nIn another instance, Beijing attempted to enforce its sovereignty claims through the\nvisa process. A visa was initially denied because an American scholar had stated that\n“Hong Kong” and “Taiwan” were places he had previously visited, instead of “Hong\nKong SAR,” and “Taiwan, China.” Most of the scholars interviewed believe that the\nprocess of gaining a visa has become much more politicized and difficult in the past\nyear or two, with much more scrutiny given to an applicant’s political views. Among\nthose interviewed, only one think-tank scholar reported actually being denied a visa.\n(However, there have been reports of other think-tank analysts being rejected who\nare reluctant to go public about their denials.) In addition, most of those interviewed\nobserved that the Chinese embassy now often issues visas the day before or even the\nmorning of departure, making the visa process laborious and nerve‐racking.\nTwo interviewees reported that companies that specialize in expediting visa\napplications have indicated that their respective think tanks are on a blacklist that\nmakes obtaining visas problematic. In one case, an interviewee related a case in which\nThink Tanks\n69\na junior researcher was told not to list the think tank as her place of employment\non her visa application or it might be rejected. (To avoid this scenario, the senior\nresearcher reached out to a Chinese official to pave the way and the visa was issued.)\nIn another instance, a visa expediter was banned from doing business with the\nChinese embassy after it informed a think tank that it had landed on a list making\nit difficult to get visas.\nA senior Chinese official told one think-tank analyst that responsibility for reviewing\nvisa requests has shifted from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Ministry of\nPublic Security, thus creating many delays and difficulties. One US think-tank scholar\nreported that he has not only been advised on a number of occasions not to even\napply for a visa but also has had a planned invitation to a conference hosted by an\nAmerican company revoked because the Foreign Ministry told the company not to\ninvite him. Others have been granted visas only for “personal” trips, with the proviso\nthat they do no public speaking nor meet with anyone outside of family members or\ncultural figures.\nThink-tank scholars report that on several occasions, when one member of a\ndelegation has been in danger of not receiving a visa (or not receiving it in time),\nreaching out to the Chinese Embassy or consular officials (in one case threatening to\ncancel the delegation) has resulted in a favorable disposition. Two think tanks now\nroutinely reach out to Chinese officials before submitting applications in order to pave\nthe way. Nonetheless, a few think-tank analysts are concerned about being beholden\nto the embassy or the consulate and the shadow such dependency casts on their ability\nto continue their work. One analyst indicated that although he is asked to help other\nmembers of the think tank with their visa issues, he does not want to be in debt to the\nembassy and therefore does not offer to help proactively.\nChinese Media and Think Tanks\nThe Chinese media offer both opportunities and pitfalls to American think-tank\nanalysts. A significant part of a think-tank analyst’s job is to influence official and\npublic opinion—and the media, whether Chinese or Western, is an essential part of\nthat process. Think-tank analysts are under no illusion, however, that the Chinese\nmedia can be trusted to present their ideas as they are delivered. As one interviewee\nunderscored, “The desire of Chinese media is to make Americans see things the\nChinese way—in a positive and beneficial light—and to present positive American\nviews to the Chinese public. You have to be prepared that the Chinese media will have\nleading questions and know that they will not include critical things.” One senior\nUS scholar has had multiple experiences of censorship, and one case of fabricated\nquotations, by Chinese newspapers. It is also apparent that Chinese journalists\nSection 5\n70\nincreasingly flood public events put on by US think tanks in Washington, using the\nevents as press conferences and to pose leading questions. While Western reporters are\nnot immune to this type of behavior, the Chinese media undertake such distortions\nin a far more systematic manner, with a pointed political agenda that is usually\ndetermined by the government’s current political “line.”\nWith this in mind, US think-tank analysts have developed a varied set of approaches\nto their interactions with the Chinese media. Some see the Chinese media as an\nopportunity to get their views across to the Chinese public, even though, as one think\ntanker acknowledges, he knows he may be censored in “inappropriate ways.” Another\nstated that despite the obvious biases, he still gives a lot of interviews—to CCTV,\nCGTN, Xinhua, People’s Daily, and the Shanghai Media Group, among them. At least\none claims that while he does frequent CGTN interviews, he has never been censored.\nSeveral US think-tank scholars indicate that they keep track of their interviews, and if\nthey are misquoted, they stop speaking to that journalist. One notes that he refuses to\ndo interviews on sensitive political issues, such as party congresses. Another indicates\nhe will only do live television as a hedge against being censored, while another\nindicates he will only be interviewed in written email form. Two analysts refuse to\ngive interviews to Chinese media at all, with the exception of those that occur in\nthe immediate aftermath of a public talk when an analyst is approached by Chinese\njournalists. In one case, an analyst reported that Xinhua conducted an in-person\nbackground interview after she refused to write an op-ed, but she was willing to share\nher views (which were negative). Xinhua then drafted a full, positive-sounding op-ed\nin her name, which they planned to publish without her approval. She successfully\nblocked it, and her institute now has a blanket ban on interviews with the Chinese\npress unless there is a special reason. This is intended to send a message that they do\nnot believe the Chinese media can be trusted.\nThe opportunity to earn money through interviews was mentioned by one scholar. She\nnoted that CGTN pays $150 per interview. The network warned her, however, that if\nshe was too critical of the Chinese government, she would not be invited back. CGTN\nalso indicated that she should be “more like” another think-tank analyst who had\nbecome a regular on CGTN.\nWriting and Publishing in China\nThe majority of the think-tank analysts who have been interviewed for this section\nhave refused to write op-eds for Chinese newspapers, with several stating that they\nhave had bad experiences in which content has been censored. One scholar reports\nseveral instances of pieces being commissioned by Global Times, only to have his piece\nspiked after submission because of its controversial content. Others, however, have\nThink Tanks\n71\nwritten for Chinese publications and have not experienced any such issues. Several\nanalysts noted that they have heard that their articles and reports have been translated\ninto Chinese in neibu (internal circulation) channels for consumption by think tanks\nand government officials. One interviewee commented that if what she writes is\npositive, it is published openly; if it is critical, it is only published internally.\nA number of interviewees also reported that their work had been improperly published\non Chinese websites. Sohu has taken think-tank reports and put them online without\npermission; one analyst forced the company to take them down from the web. Another\nscholar reported that a Chinese think tank at one point claimed she was one of its\nfellows and posted bogus content on its website that it alleged she had written.\nWhile some of the think-tank scholars interviewed have had their books translated\ninto Chinese by mainland presses, most have not. A growing number do not try,\nrecognizing that significant parts of their books would never make it past the censors.\nWhen informed privately by the translator of her book that large portions were being\nexcised, one scholar halted the Chinese publication process. Another scholar battled\nfor two years with the Chinese publisher after the contract had been signed between\nthe Western and Chinese publishers. The State Press and Publishing Administration\ndemanded more than seventy deletions, finally settling on five with the agreement\nof the scholar. In the end, however, the Chinese publisher informed the scholar’s\npublisher that the book could not proceed to publication because of “unfriendly\nremarks” the scholar had been making in the media. Most US scholars simply do not\nbother with mainland publishers and look for publication opportunities in Taiwan or\nHong Kong. Several US scholars believe that there are pirated copies of their books or\nat least partially translated copies available within China. At least one scholar found\nthat a search on Baidu yielded half of her most recent book online.\nNot all scholars are willing to sacrifice the opportunity to be published in China.\nOne analyst reported that a senior non-China expert at their think tank permitted\nhis book to be published in China, even though several pages had been mistranslated\nand the editors had actually created some new passages that did not exist anywhere\nin the original text. Even the title and subtitle of the book, as well as the author’s own\nprofessional title, were incorrectly identified.\nPublic Voice\nThe issue of censorship also arises in the context of how think-tank analysts present\ntheir own views publicly, especially when in China. On the whole, think-tank scholars\nshow determination to raise sensitive topics and be forthright in presenting their\nviews. But it is an understandable human instinct to want to be polite and diplomatic\nwhile still conveying one’s own views honestly. As one scholar, who also does a lot of\nSection 5\n72\nconsulting, noted, “Access to China is my livelihood.” At the same time, he argues,\n“I never say anything contrary to my views, but I write in a way that is less shrill.”\nAnother scholar noted, “I don’t self-censor, but there is no need to launch a polemic\nevery day of the week . . . ​polemics get your visa cut off. China’s greatest power is\nthe power of visa control.” A third commented, “I don’t censor the substance, but\nI may modulate what I say.” He argued that he sometimes indulges the sensibilities of\nthe PRC in order to get his deeper point across. As another analyst noted, “I avoid\nsensationalizing. I am willing to be critical, but I try not to make attacks on Xi.”\nAnd different interviewees distinguish between writing and speaking: “I do not\ncompromise on writing, but I am cautious in interviews: I will say the same message\nbut indirectly, not confrontationally.” One analyst said, “I make sure that if I go into\nbattle, I do so thoughtfully, not accidentally.” She tries to be very strategic about the\nmessages that she sends and tries not to weigh in on every small issue or bluntly\ncharge, “You are wrong!” In a similar vein, one other scholar says he often uses an\ninterrogatory, rather than accusatory, approach when raising challenging issues, such\nas human rights.\nThe knowledge that what an analyst says publicly reflects not only on the individual\nbut also on the analyst’s institution also shapes at least one scholar’s thinking: “There\nis a conflict between protecting your institute and speaking truthfully. Whether it is\nover access or money. Sometimes I put the positive first—and then say . . .’but some\npeople say.’ I might not start right off with Xi Jinping—I might be more indirect. In\npublic meetings, there is a tacit understanding that you will not be super critical of\nChina.” Another suggests that it is “very hard not to subconsciously self-censor.” This\nperson indicated that when their institute does projects on counterterrorism in the\nMiddle East or Southeast Asia, they are very careful about discussing China’s restive\nregion of Xinjiang where up to one million Uighurs are presently believed to be in\nreeducation camps. In general, they do not take on projects concerning Taiwan or\nXinjiang.\nInterviewees expressed a deep sensitivity around the issue of Taiwan and how to refer\nto the island and its officials. One analyst observed that in an invitation, his institute\nwould not identify Taiwan’s representative to the United States as an “ambassador,” but\nduring the event, he would indeed orally introduce the official as the “ambassador.” Or\nas another scholar noted, “I am tactful but keep to my original point of view. I don’t\nchange the substance. On Taiwan, in private conversations, I use President Tsai—but I\nalso maintain neutrality in public to ensure that is acceptable to Taiwan and the PRC.”\nTwo analysts stated that they do not self-censor “at all.” They understand the\ntemptation, but they try to write and say in public exactly what they would in private.\nThink Tanks\n73\nPressure from Think-Tank Boards or Outside Influencers\nInteraction between think-tank analysts and the members of their institution’s boards\nof trustees varies significantly. Some engage frequently, socialize, and consult on\nChina-related issues—while others have virtually no contact. Only three interviewees\nreported incidents of attempted interference. In one case, a prominent former board\nmember complained to the head of the think tank about an article that was “too tough”\non China. However, no pressure, besides the obviously intimidating impact of having\na piece of writing singled out by an overseer, was brought to bear on the scholar. In\nanother case, a board member tried to pressure a think-tank president to avoid hosting\nthe Dalai Lama, but failed. A third instance involved the Hong Kong political activist\ndiscussed earlier. The tendency can also work in the other direction. One scholar\nindicated that his board is very involved and has lately become tougher on China in\nrecent years, focusing on “how do we still counter China, yet still engage.”\nChinese Nationals in US Think Tanks\nAmerican think-tank analysts differ in their assessment of the risks and rewards\nfor hosting Chinese scholars as visiting fellows or employing Chinese nationals on\nstaff, with most suggesting that it is better to have them inside the think tanks to\nunderstand how they are thinking and working. One analyst said he “assumed some\nor all would be interrogated” when they returned to China. “RAND,” he said, “should\nbe worried.” One researcher noted that she is “careful to keep Chinese nationals from\nattending sensitive meetings featuring US officials or military officers,” but otherwise\nwelcomes them to events.\nOnly one Washington think tank hosts Chinese scholars on a regular and continuous\nbasis (although Washington-based universities do so more often), including them in\nprogramming and most meetings, even when funded by a Chinese host institution.\nScholars at this institution view them as valuable for gaining insights and for training\npurposes. Another think-tank analyst who has hosted visiting fellows from China\npointed out that two prominent Chinese scholars who spent time at their institution\nwent back and wrote “important papers.” Still, some expressed concern over all the\n“bright young Chinese showing up on Mass [Massachusetts] Ave.” and the potential\nthat they might have for reporting back to Beijing. The scholar noted that think\ntanks want young people to “plow through the Chinese literature,” and this means\nhiring Chinese nationals, Chinese Americans, or Taiwanese because of their language\nabilities. Some analysts expressed concerns that think-tank analysts who are of\nChinese nationality (either nationals or American citizens) may face special pressures\nfrom the imputation that as ethnic Chinese, they are susceptible to Chinese influence\nand control.\nSection 5\n74\nBroader Concerns\nThink-tank analysts voiced a range of concerns around the issue of Chinese\ninfluence–seeking activities in the United States. One is the deliberate effort to manage\nUS perceptions and to frame issues in ways that are favorable to the Chinese\nCommunist Party. As one analyst noted, “This requires pushback, which is tough work.”\nWhile many believed that they could adequately defend themselves against efforts to\ninfluence them, noting as one did that the “the general capacity of US society to push\nback is not bad,” they worried about their colleagues who were not knowledgeable\nChina experts and might therefore be more easily deceived. For example, one scholar\npointed out that with US-China cooperation, the incentive is to come up with shared\nvalues and ideas. He noted that in the case of the Sanya Initiative (the US-China\ndialogue featuring retired military officers from both sides), he has had to “talk them\n(the American participants) off the ledge; they think they are being tough, but they\nare mistaken.” This same analyst sees the American media as complicit in echoing\nChinese perspectives, noting that when Xi Jinping delivered his speech in Davos in\nJanuary 2017, few reporters understood that the Chinese were in the midst of a major\npropaganda campaign to promote globalization 2.0. He also suggests that there is “de\nfacto self-censorship” of entire areas of scholarship: human rights for one. Another\nanalyst noted that outside of the National Endowment for Democracy, she does not see\nmuch foundation interest in normal discourse in this issue either.\nOne scholar worried about growing Chinese control over all areas of US-Chinese\ninteraction: “The Chinese are following people, bugging our hotel rooms. There is\nimbalanced control that serves CCP interests not ours. There is lack of serious training\nby the US side on how to deal with Chinese influence.” The potential for Chinese\nmoney to give China leverage over American think tanks also provoked a degree of\nanxiety. Several scholars expressed concern over funding issues, noting that reliance\non a single funder with an agenda makes scholars vulnerable. In addition, one scholar\nworried that the amount of money China is spending to promote its views, whether\nthrough think-tank cooperation or the Chinese media (such as CGTN paying for its\ninterviews) means that China will ultimately be able to “buy its way in.”\nA number of analysts believed that the involvement of the US government in these\nissues will only make things more contentious. There is concern that Washington will\noverreact. As one analyst noted, there is a type of “binaryism in Washington, in which\nyou must be ‘for or against’ China; you are either friendly to China or producing stuff\nthat says China is evil.” This scholar, along with several others, raised the issue of\nthe rise of anti-China sentiments, such as the “yellow peril” and McCarthyism, and\nexpressed concern about Chinese Americans and anyone who has interests with China\ncoming under attack. One analyst mentioned the Committee of 100, a collection of\nprominent Chinese Americans, as being particularly vulnerable to unfair attack.\nThink Tanks\n75\nAnother analyst noted that we need “a granular view on issues of sharp power.”\nHe pointed in particular to Confucius Institutes, arguing that he would not accept\nConfucius Institute–sponsored research, but was fine with language training, although\nit would be better to get them off campuses. He laughed at the idea that they were\n“effective instruments of Chinese propaganda.” Along these lines, a few individuals\nindicated that they were less concerned about Chinese influence in the social sciences\nand more concerned about reports that Chinese students and postdocs in scientific\nresearch labs bring restricted technologies back to China.\nFinally, there were calls from some analysts for far more reciprocity than currently exists.\nThese analysts felt that the playing field between the two countries was out of balance\nand argued that there should be a much stronger dose of reciprocity and “hardball” in\nUS-China exchanges, arguing that the American side should curtail or cut off contacts\nuntil Chinese institutions were willing to operate at a level of openness similar to that\nfound in their American counterparts.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nAmerican think-tank scholars working on China face an increasingly challenging\nresearch environment. But in this challenge, they are hardly unique. Members of\nthe media and the civil society/NGO world also share similar, even more daunting,\nchallenges. The process for obtaining visas has become more onerous; the quality of\nengagement with Chinese counterparts has declined and become more difficult; and\nopportunities to do field-based research, as well as archival work, have diminished.\nTrack 2 dialogues are viewed with increasing skepticism as to their value by more\nand more US scholars and policy specialists, who find their Chinese colleagues ever\nmore unable and/or unwilling to share their perspectives in an open and meaningful\nmanner. Many think-tank analysts are responding by limiting their Track 2 efforts and\nchanging the way they conduct their research.\nAt the same time, a small but growing group of well-funded Chinese scholars and\nofficials are proactively seeking to shape the American narrative and American views\nof China. They are doing so by supporting and funding joint projects with American\npartners in ways that reflect Chinese government priorities, but they give them the\nopportunity to choose and work with only those American scholars viewed by China\nas sympathetic to China’s goals. To date, these efforts do not appear to have influenced\nthe US debate over China in a significant manner, but it is important to be aware of\nthe money and effort being thrown at the endeavor.\nChinese funding of American think tanks remains limited. C.H. Tung, through his\nChina-US Exchange Foundation, is to date the most common source of financial\nsupport, although most report his funding as “hands-off.” A few Chinese companies\nSection 5\n76\nhave also bankrolled a limited number of American think-tank activities. However,\nAmerican think tanks with centers in China have actively engaged in fund-raising\nfrom mainland Chinese sources. With only a few exceptions, American think-tank\nanalysts do not foresee that Chinese money will become a significant factor in their\nwork at home any time soon, although because of endemic funding shortages at most\nnonprofits, worries about reliance on Chinese money are not unfounded.\nChinese media relentlessly solicit American think-tank scholars’ opinions for\nconsumption within both the United States and China. At least one outlet pays\nparticipants for their time and makes it clear that criticism of China is unwelcome.\nCensorship of written work is common, even expected, so that few interviewees expect\nto have their books published in China. American think-tank analysts appear most\nannoyed when their work is illegally and/or incorrectly published on Chinese websites.\nIn most instances, they seek to have the work taken down from the web.\nAmerican think-tank analysts have a highly developed understanding of Chinese\nefforts to influence their views —whether in the form of heavy-handed criticism\nfrom the Chinese embassy for an article or a proposed meeting with someone like the\nDalai Lama, a Hong Kong dissident, or via more subtle efforts that arise through joint\nprojects funded by Chinese partners. To the last one, all interviewees for this study\nindicated that they refuse to be pressured into changing their practices. Some\nthink-tank scholars acknowledge that they try to be diplomatic in their public discourse\non China—but insist that they do not change their overall message, only their tone\nor choice of wording. Some argue that they save their tough language to deliver the\nmost important messages. But some also admit to acceding to Chinese demands on\nhow to present Taiwanese officials in public settings—such as in the announcements\nof a meeting on the think tank’s website—but then adopting the Taiwanese preference\nduring the meeting itself. The general view—although not shared by all—was that\nseeking to avoid unnecessarily insulting or upsetting the Chinese is the better strategy.\nBut most agreed that the arena of acceptable parlance was shrinking and that pressures\nwere growing.\nAs an antidote, the American think-tank community should understand that its position\nis one with significant leverage. Chinese officials and scholars seek to use think tanks\nas venues for visiting Chinese officials, as legitimating partners for Chinese-supported\nresearch projects that will influence the American narrative, and as important sources\nof information concerning the changing US political landscape. The American scholars\nshould celebrate their principles of independence, use the leverage their institutional\nframeworks provide to resist incursion, and constructively push for greater reciprocity.\nSome specific recommendations include:\nThink Tanks\n77\nPromote Transparency\n• Think tanks should—in partnership with universities—jointly and regularly\nproduce summaries of difficulties in China-related research (access to regions,\nagencies, persons, visas, etc.) and make these available to each other and to\nUS officials. The latter, in turn, should be mindful of the reciprocal nature of\nthink-tank work and how the inability of American scholars to secure meetings\nwith Chinese officials and scholars when Chinese scholars are afforded such\nprivileges is harmful to the stability of the overall relationship.\n• Think tanks should publicly disclose the source of funding for events, publications,\nand other activities. If think-tank leaders elect to solicit funds from Hong Kong\nor mainland Chinese sources, they should be transparent about from where the\nmoney came and how it is being used, to ensure that there is no opportunity for\nthe Chinese funder to harmfully affect the research agenda or outcome.\nPromote Integrity\n• A Code of Conduct should be worked out among US think tanks—perhaps in\nconjunction with American university China studies centers—to establish “do’s and\ndon’ts” in their exchanges with Chinese institutions. Once this is worked out among\nAmerican institutions, then counterparts in other democratic countries should also\nbe approached with an eye toward establishing multilateral Codes of Conduct.\nPromote Reciprocity\n• US think-tank representatives—the presidents and senior China scholars—should\narrange a meeting with the Chinese ambassador to express their collective\nperspectives on these issues and call for changes. Such a meeting could be\nusefully coupled with a jointly signed letter of concern by directors of all major\nUS think tanks.\n• If any member of any think-tank delegation is denied a visa, the delegation\nshould cancel the trip. It sends a profoundly wrong signal to proceed, if China\nis able to control the composition of a delegation. The think tank should also\nconsider a moratorium on Chinese officials visiting or speaking at the think tank\nuntil the visa issues are resolved. The same principle may be applied to Chinese\nthink tanks that refuse to receive American scholars for visits. In such cases,\nUS think tanks should seriously consider not hosting residential stays for Chinese\nvisiting scholars from institutions that do not offer parallel opportunities for\nAmerican scholars in China. (At present, only the Chinese Academy of Social\nSciences and the Shanghai Institute of International Studies permit foreign\nscholars in residence.)\nSection 5\n78\n• The US government should not unilaterally grant Chinese think-tank or university\nscholars ten-year visas, as it has been doing, without exacting across-the-board\nreciprocal treatment for US think-tank and university scholars. At the same time,\nthe US government should also advocate consistently on behalf of US think-tank\nand university scholars who have been barred from visiting China.\nTwo core values cut across all of our concerns: freedom of speech and reciprocity. As a\ndemocratic society, we should tolerate no infringements—overt or covert—on our\nfreedom of speech and freedom of analysis concerning China. A “leveling of the\nplaying field” in terms of upholding the principles and practicalities of reciprocity in\nour exchanges with Chinese counterparts is needed, because it is an essential part of\nmaking the relationship both more equitable and reciprocal and more stable and thus\ndurable.\nNotes\n1 ​These include: the American Enterprise Institute, Asia Society, Carnegie Endowment for International\nPeace, Brookings Institute, Center for American Progress, Center for Strategic and International Studies,\nCouncil on Foreign Relations, International Peace Institute, Institute for China-American Studies, Kissinger\nInstitute on China and the United States, and Stimson Center.\nThink Tanks\nSECTION 6\nMedia\nWhen the Xinhua News Agency leased a massive sign in Times Square in 2011 and then\nagreed to a twenty-year lease for a new US headquarters on the top floor of a Broadway\nskyscraper, it was clear that, as analyst He Qinglian put it, “The Chinese have arrived.” 1\nXinhua’s foray into Manhattan was followed by a website of the People’s Daily, the\nmouthpiece of the Communist Party, which set up shop in the Empire State Building. 2\nAt a time when Western media outlets are challenged by the internet and weakened\nby uncertain business models, China’s rise as a major player in the media landscape\naround the globe has become all the more worthy of attention. The Chinese\ngovernment’s campaign to “grab the right to speak” from Western media outlets and\nindependent Chinese voices, which it accuses of distorting news about China and\nsullying China’s image, has come with a rapid expansion of China’s English-language\nmedia operations, a concerted campaign to control overseas Chinese-language media,\nand ongoing efforts to block attempts by Western media to contend inside China.\nXinhua News Agency journalist Xiong Min summed up the motivation for China’s\nnew campaign in 2010. “The right to speak in the world is not distributed equally,” she\nwrote. “Eighty percent of the information is monopolized by Western media.” 3 It was\ntime, she said, to end that monopoly by means of what China has called the Grand\nExternal Propaganda Campaign ( 大外宣 ).\nSince coming to power, President Xi Jinping has overseen the intensification of this\nexternal propaganda blitz, which was launched in 2007 by former Party general\nsecretary Hu Jintao. As Xi told the November 2014 Foreign Affairs Work Conference\nin Beijing: “We should increase China’s soft power, give a good Chinese narrative,\nand better communicate China’s messages to the world.” 4 This is the task CCP\npropagandists have now undertaken in an increasingly fulsome way. On February 19,\n2016, Xi visited the headquarters of the People’s Daily, Xinhua News Agency, and China\nCentral Television, where he again stressed the importance of external propaganda\nwork. 5 At the August 2018 National Meeting on Ideology and Propaganda, Xi stated:\n“To present good images, we should improve our international communication\ncapability, tell China’s stories well, disseminate China’s voice, show an authentic\n80\nand comprehensive China to the world, and raise the country’s soft power and the\ninfluence of Chinese culture.” 6 External propaganda work has long been an important\nforeign policy instrument for the Chinese Communist Party and the People’s Republic\nof China, but under Xi it has become a top priority of China’s party-state.\nState Media\nChina’s Communist Party and government have a long history of trying to influence\ninternational opinion. Over the years, the themes of its external propaganda have\nvaried substantially—usually in parallel with dramatic fluctuations in its own domestic\npolitical campaigns ( 运动 ) and related slogans ( 口号 ), shifts in ideology ( 意识形态 ), meta\npropaganda narratives ( 提法 ), and substantive elements in China’s diplomacy ( 外交 ).\nThe shifts in Beijing’s propaganda lines ( 宣传路线 ) throughout PRC history have been\ndizzyingly consistent, but they are always important to follow as indicators of the\ncountry’s direction.\nDuring the 1950s, Communist China used organizations such as the China News\nService, a successor to the Party’s International News Agency (founded in 1938), to\nappeal to overseas Chinese for support of the new revolution. The Party placed this\nnews service under the State Council’s Office for Overseas Chinese Affairs. Other\npropaganda campaigns targeted allies in the Western world, such as black nationalist\nfigures from the United States like Robert Williams, who were given airtime on\nshortwave broadcasts from Beijing, and a few Western writers and journalists, like\nEdgar Snow, Felix Greene, and William Hinton, who were offered rare, and sometimes\nlucrative, peeks behind the Bamboo Curtain.\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976, Beijing’s propaganda outreach to\noverseas Chinese slowed, as the Party persecuted those in China with foreign ties. But\nfollowing the arrest of the Gang of Four in 1976 and the economic reform program\nled by Deng Xiaoping in the early 1980s, the Party once again directly engaged with\nthe overseas Chinese community as well as with mainstream Western society and\nmedia, appealing to all comers to help China modernize. In 1980, the Party formed\nthe External Propaganda Group ( 对外宣传小组 ) and placed it under the Propaganda\nDepartment of the CCP Central Committee. Zhu Muzhi, the former chief of the\nXinhua News Agency and a vice minister of propaganda, was its first head. In 1991, the\ngroup was transferred to the State Council, where it was still internally referred to as\nthe External Propaganda Group. For foreign consumption, however, it was called the\nState Council Information Office.\nMedia\n81\nFrom 1980, Beijing added to its stable of foreign-facing propaganda publications—such\nas Beijing Review, China Reconstructs, and China Pictorial—by starting or reopening\nmore than twenty periodicals, including the English-language China Daily, the overseas\nedition of the People’s Daily, the overseas edition of Outlook ( 望 ), and the Voice of China\n( 华声报 ). The Party also resumed publishing material for overseas Chinese. During the\nCultural Revolution, the number of magazines targeting overseas Chinese had shrunk\nto ten, whereas by the end of the 1980s, it had surpassed 130. Before 1982, the state-run\nXinhua News Agency had focused almost solely on providing news to domestic Chinese\nclients. In 1983, however, it also began sending news to international clients. The China\nNews Service, which had suspended operations during the Cultural Revolution, also\nresumed work, sending hundreds of stories a day to overseas Chinese-language media.\nToday the CNS employs more than two thousand people worldwide, working out of\nforty-six bureaus. The Party directed its media outlets in their overseas work to support\nsocialism with Chinese characteristics, push the policies of reform and opening up, and\noppose hegemonism, or, in other words, fight against Western ideological control.\nIn the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, China’s propaganda agencies redoubled\ntheir efforts to “grab the right to speak,” or gain “discourse power” ( 话语权 ).\nThe worldwide torch-lighting ceremony touched off free-Tibet rallies and other\nhuman rights protests that angered Chinese authorities and some Chinese as well.\nAn anti-CNN movement began in China, alleging that Western media outlets were\ndistorting “China’s story.” This was the genesis for what has come to be known as the\nGrand Overseas Propaganda Campaign ( 大外宣 ), first promoted by the administration\nof Party Chief Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao. The International Herald Leader, a\npublication of the Xinhua News Agency, reported in 2009 that foreign propaganda\nwork had been elevated by the Party to a “systematic, strategic position,” the goal of\nwhich was to “grab back the right to speak, and improve China’s international image.” 7\nReports that had first surfaced in Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post in 2009, that\nChina had earmarked $7 billion for the campaign, were soon repeated by the Chinese\nmedia, most notably in the March 14 edition of Phoenix Weekly. 8\nThe Grand Overseas Propaganda Campaign has been grand, indeed, with Chinese\nsources reporting hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on a multitude of projects\ndesigned to bolster China’s image. The expansion of the Xinhua News Agency is but\none example. From 120, the number of Xinhua bureaus around the world has now\ngrown to more than 200 9 and its client base has expanded to more than 1,450. What is\nmore, it now reports in seven languages and competes directly with all the major wire\nSection 6\n82\nservices of the world. In the United States, Xinhua doubled the number of bureaus,\nadding Chicago, Houston, and San Francisco to its original footprint in Washington,\nDC, New York, and Los Angeles. Xinhua, like other state-owned Chinese media outlets,\nalso began hiring local talent, and in 2009 it began a TV broadcast in English.\nAs part of this vigorous propaganda campaign, the Party has sought to turn China\nCentral Television into a global competitor to CNN. CCTV was already airing in\nAmerica as of 2004, when it cooperated with EchoStar, America’s second-largest\nsatellite TV company, to launch the Chinese “Great Wall Platform” package, including\ntwelve Mandarin channels, two Cantonese channels, one Hokkien channel, and one\nEnglish channel. That same year, Rupert Murdoch’s News Group helped CCTV place\nprogramming on Time Warner and NewsCorp’s US television network. CCTV also\nexpanded its offerings in the United States, growing its bureau in Washington and\nhiring American reporters too. By 2012, CCTV, recently renamed the China Global\nTelevision Network (CGTN), was broadcasting in seven languages. Its programs\nfor American audiences regularly feature personalities from Russia’s state-funded\npropaganda outlet, RT, which was recently required to register as a foreign agent; RT,\nin turn, regularly features CGTN personalities.\nChina Radio International (CRI) was also given a foreign platform. Decades ago, the\nBeijing-based propaganda outlet relied solely on shortwave broadcasts to beam China’s\nmessage to the world, but in the late 2000s it began leasing local stations around the\nglobe and across the United States that it supplied with content made in Beijing. CRI\nhas used a US-based company through which it leases stations. That firm is EDI Media\nInc. ( 鷹龍傳媒有限公司 ), which also owns other media properties that tow Beijing’s line:\nG&E TV ( 環球東方衛視 ), G&E Studio Network ( 環球東方電台 ), and EDI City Newsweek\n( 城市新聞週刊 ). 10 A CRI subsidiary in China, Guoguang Century Media, holds a majority\nstake in G&E Studio. 11 When it comes to reporting on mainland China, the content of\nall of EDI’s outlets mirrors that of China’s state-owned media.\nChina’s state-run media have proved to be nimble in accomplishing Beijing’s goal of\npenetrating US markets. In 2013, the Hong Kong–based Phoenix Satellite TV group,\nwhich has close ties to the Chinese state and broadcasts in China, attempted to\npurchase two major FM stations in Los Angeles that shared the same frequency. One of\nthem, KDAY, covers West L.A., while KDEY stretches into Riverside and San Bernardino\ncounties to the east of the city. Greater Los Angeles is home to more than a half million\nChinese, the second-biggest concentration next to New York City. But none of the\nMedia\n83\nregion’s Chinese-language radio stations are particularly loyal to Beijing, representing\neither independent Chinese voices or those supporting the banned religious sect, Falun\nGong. According to sources close to the deal, Phoenix structured the offer to avoid a\nUS law that limits foreign ownership of US radio stations to 25 percent. In filings with\nthe Federal Communications Commission, Phoenix was listed as owning 20 percent of\nthe US-based investor, RBC, while the remaining 80 percent was owned by an editor\nat Phoenix who is also a US citizen. 12 Under such a setup, no FCC regulations would\nhave been broken. To be extra sure that the deal would go through, however, advisors\nto Phoenix convinced the Hong Kong company to seek approval from the Committee\non Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a Treasury Department bureau\nthat monitors foreign investments in the United States on national security grounds.\nIn a ruling that surprised the potential investors, CFIUS declined to approve the deal,\nreferring it to then-president Obama. Sources close to the deal noted that the fact that a\nPhoenix employee in the United States had pleaded guilty to espionage-related charges\ndid not help Phoenix’s case. 13 RBC pulled out of the deal on September 25, 2013.\nBut the efforts to break into the L.A. radio market did not end there. In the summer\nof 2018, a New York firm, H&H Capital Partners, announced that it was buying a\nMexican radio station, XEWW, that broadcasts throughout Southern California. 14\nSources involved in that deal said that H&H sought to buy a Mexican station in\norder to avoid scrutiny in the United States. H&H is a New York-based firm led by\nseveral individuals who spent years working as reporters for Global Times, a state-run\nnewspaper in China. Filings from H&H to the FCC about the deal suggest that Phoenix\nSatellite TV remains a player in the purchase as the address that H&H gave for its Los\nAngeles–based holding company was the same as Phoenix’s offices in L.A. 15 H&H’s\nattempt to buy XEWW to broadcast into the United States has been challenged at the\nFCC by a Chinese-language radio station linked to Falun Gong. 16\nChina’s main English-language newspaper, China Daily, has also expanded operations\ninto America, starting a North American edition in 2009. In addition, through its\nmarketing arm, China Watch, the paper began distributing English-language content\ndirectly as advertising inserts in the Wall Street Journal, the Des Moines Register, and the\nWashington Post, among other leading US newspapers. Often, it’s hard to tell that China\nWatch’s material is an ad, as was the case highlighted by President Donald Trump with\nan advertising insert in the Sunday Des Moines Register—an insert that the president\nsuggested was aimed at undermining political support both for the president and the\nRepublican party. 17 Rough estimates from newspaper executives indicate that China\nSection 6\n84\nDaily pays $250,000 for each insert in major US dailies. In 2009, the Global Times ( 环球\n时报 ), part of the People’s Daily group, started an English-language newspaper as well.\nChinese investment in the US media market is not limited to the central government.\nChinese provincial media firms also have a footprint in the United States. Sky Link TV\n( 天下衛視 ) is one example. It is fully owned by Guangzhou Media American Co, Ltd.\n( 美國廣視傳媒有限公司 ), which, in turn, is owned by GZ Television Media ( 广州影视传媒有限公司 ), a Chinese state-owned media outlet. Sky Link’s story also illustrates the switch\nfrom Taiwan money to mainland money in the US Chinese-language media world. Sky\nLink was established in 1989 by a Taiwanese corporation. In 2009, it was purchased by\na private Chinese company; three years later, the Chinese state-owned GZ Television\nMedia bought Sky Link TV, a takeover that was hailed by the PRC’s Ministry of\nCommerce as a key “cultural export” in 2014. 18 When Sky Link TV reports on China,\nthe Sino-US relationship, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other important issues concerning\nChina, it follows and quite often repeats verbatim the official line from PRC media. Its\nmajor business partners include CCTV and Xinhua.\nThe Grand Overseas Propaganda Campaign has continued under the regime of General\nSecretary Xi Jinping, who, in his 2014 New Year’s address, called on all media friendly\nto the CCP to “better tell China’s story.” In March 2018, the Party announced plans\nto unite these individual efforts into a mammoth overseas-facing propaganda organ,\nknown as the Voice of China, by merging the foreign operations of China Global\nTelevision Network, China National Radio and China Radio International. 19 (It is not\nclear whether the parallel with the Voice of America was intentional.)\nDespite all of these efforts, President Xi still appears to be unsatisfied with the Party’s\nefforts to “grab the right to speak.” In August 2018, the Chinese government announced\na shake-up in its propaganda organs, reflecting significant concern at the heart of the\nParty that China was not winning its ideological battle with the West. 20\nDiaspora Media\nIn the early 1990s, the state-owned China News Service and the Overseas Chinese Office of\nthe State Council dispatched editorial personnel to the United States to found the Chineselanguage\nTV broadcaster, SinoVision, and the newspaper Qiaobao ( 侨报 ). Shanghai’s\nXinmin Wanbao sent staff to the United States to start up an American edition as\nwell. Chinese officials backed this push as part of an effort to fight back against the\nnegative publicity generated by the Party’s crackdown on protests around Tiananmen\nSquare on June 4, 1989.\nMedia\n85\nThe SinoVision/Qiaobao story is illustrative of Beijing’s push to dominate Chineselanguage\nmedia in the United States. SinoVision, Qiaobao, and the Sino American Times\n( 美洲时报 ) all belong to the Asian Culture and Media Group ( 美國亞洲文化傳媒集團 ).\nSources in these firms say that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council\nof PRC ( 中國國務院僑務辦公室 ) set up the firm in the early 1990s but hid its financial role\nin these companies.\nAll the major executives of these firms appear to have been either appointed directly\nor approved by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office. 21 Most of the major executives\nand editors in these businesses served either as editors or reporters for the China News\nService or in the Overseas Chinese Office of the State Council. The group’s flagship\nnewspaper, Qiaobao, is divided into two divisions: the Western US Qiaobao ( 美国西侨胞 )\nand the Eastern United States. Qiaobao ( 美国东侨报 ). The president of the Western division\nis also the chairman of the board of directors of Rhythm Media Group, a corporation\nthat consists of Qiaobao and a few other media outlets, including radio stations in\nSeattle and elsewhere. 22 The chairman worked for the official China News Service ( 中新社 ) for many years as a reporter before coming to the United States to establish the\nWestern US Qiaobao in the 1990s. The China News Service is a branch of the Overseas\nChinese Affairs Office. In 2015, the service described the work of the top executives of\nthe Eastern US Qiaobao’s ( 美东侨报 ) work as part of the PRC’s broader push to strengthen\nits “soft power” and fight back against “Western media hegemony.” 23 Qiaobao is the\nsole major newspaper to use simplified Chinese characters in an effort to appeal to\nimmigrants from mainland China living abroad. Almost all the news stories in Qiaobao\nabout China, the Sino-US relationship, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other important issues\nimportant to China are taken directly from official Chinese media outlets or websites,\nincluding CCTV, Xinhua, and the People’s Daily. Its current editor is I-Der Jeng, and in an\nemail communication with Foreign Policy magazine, he stated that the paper receives no\neditorial direction from Beijing. 24 However, like its parent company, numerous reporters\nand editors on the paper come from China’s state-owned press outlets. 25\nThe group’s main TV outlet is SinoVision. It operates two twenty-four-hour channels\n(one Chinese and one English language), and it is on the program lineups of cable\nsystems covering about thirty million people. SinoVision’s website (http:// www​\n. sinovision​. net) ranks twelfth among all the Chinese websites in the United States. Like\nits sister newspapers, SinoVision was established in 1990 as part of the PRC’s first push\nto establish propaganda outlets in the United States. It is headquartered in New York\nCity, with branches in Boston, Washington, DC, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco,\nand Seattle. According to Wang Aibing ( 王艾冰 ), a former executive of SinoVision,\nSection 6\n86\nstarting in 1990, the State Council’s Overseas Chinese Affairs Office gave $800,000\na year to SinoVision, ultimately increasing its subsidy to between $2 million and\n$3 million a year. Wang made this charge in a 2011 letter to the Overseas Chinese\nAffairs Office alleging widespread corruption at the station. 26 Allegations of corruption\nand governmental subsidies have not been corroborated.\nWhat is clear, however, is that, like Qiaobao, SinoVision’s content echoes China’s\nofficial media. The vast majority of its stories about China, Sino-American relations,\nTaiwan, Hong Kong, and other important issues for the PRC government are taken\ndirectly from official Chinese media outlets or websites, including CCTV, Xinhua,\nand the People’s Daily. In an essay, Qiaobao’s Eastern Group president, You Jiang,\ndefended his paper’s support of the PRC’s agenda by saying that it stemmed not\nfrom Beijing’s direction, but from demands from pro-Chinese immigrants in the\nUnited States. 27\nForays by PRC organizations to assert direct control over Chinese-language media in\nthe United States sparked a battle with publications owned by private interests from\nTaiwan and Hong Kong that did not share the PRC’s ideological bent. PRC officials\nopenly acknowledged the political nature of this battle, and in a 2007 interview, Guo\nZhaojin, the president of the state-owned China News Service, noted that if China\ncould gain control of Chinese-language publications in the United States, China would\nbe better able to influence the overseas Chinese community, have a say in American\npolitics, and “protect the national image.” Guo further observed that more than onequarter\nof America’s minorities relied on foreign-language media to obtain their news.\nForeign-language media, said Guo, was a “giant hiding in plain sight.” 28\nBeijing seems to be winning the battle with Chinese-language outlets expressing views\nthat dissent from Beijing’s. Over the course of the last twenty years, a series of onceindependent\nChinese-language media have fallen under Beijing’s control. The Sing Tao\nNewspaper Group was established in Hong Kong in 1938. In the mid-1990s, its original\nowner 29 was forced to divest of interests in the paper, and it was soon taken over by\na pro-PRC businessman, 30 who, starting in 1998, became a member of the Chinese\nPeople’s Political Consultative Conference, which functions as part of the broader\nunited front organization network. Sing Tao’s coverage of China is clearly now aligned\nwith that of state-run media from Beijing. In fact, in May 2001, the year he purchased\nSing Tao, the owner established a joint venture with the Xinhua News Agency to create\nan information-service company known as Xinhua Online.\nMedia\n87\nAnother case in point is the World Journal ( 世界日报 ), for years the premier Chineselanguage\npaper in the United States serving immigrants from Taiwan and only one of\nthe six newspapers owned by the United Daily News (UDN), Taiwan’s most influential\nnewspaper company. The paper once dominated news coverage in Chinatowns across\nAmerica, and it acted as the voice of the Chinese Nationalist Party of Taiwan. Unlike\nPRC-controlled outlets, the World Journal did cover events such as the death of the\njailed Chinese human rights advocate and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiabo. But\nthe Journal’s coverage has shifted in recent years and become more pro-PRC in a\nvariety of areas, such as China’s militarization of the South China Sea and its handling\nof Taiwan and Hong Kong. Sources at the Journal observe that the paper’s owners in\nTaiwan are interested in growing their business in China, which may help explain\nthe paper’s evolving editorial stance. For example, in March 2004, the World Journal\npublished recruitment notices on the front page, announcing its intention to establish\na mainland news group and recruit reporters in China. In a 2015 essay, an executive 31\nat Qiaobao, one of the Journal’s main competitors, noted the Journal’s shifting editorial\nstance. “No longer do they only report negative news about the mainland,” he wrote. 32\nAccording to sources inside the newspaper, Chinese consulates in both New York and\nSan Francisco have pressured World Journal’s local offices not to publish ads related to\nthe religious sect, Falun Gong, which has been outlawed in China. The New York office\nhas already acquiesced in full for the East Coast edition. The West Coast edition now\nonly runs Falun Gong ads in throwaway sections of the paper.\nMing Pao is another formerly independent newspaper that has fallen under Beijing’s\ncontrol. For years, its US edition was popular among Cantonese-speaking immigrants\nin the United States. In January 2007, the Hong Kong Ming Pao Group announced a\n$600 million merger with the two largest Chinese-language media outlets in Malaysia,\nthe Xingzhou Media and Nanyang News. The merger was welcomed in Beijing. Guo\nZhaojin, then president of the China News Service, said the new company would\ndevelop into one of the largest Chinese print media platforms in the world, with more\nthan five newspapers in major cities in North America, Southeast Asia, and Greater\nChina and a daily circulation of more than one million copies.\nChina’s efforts to dominate Chinese-language media coincided with two other\ndevelopments in the 1990s. The Chinese immigrant community boomed in\nthe United States, as hundreds of thousands of mainland Chinese became US\ncitizens, transforming the complexion of a community that had been dominated\nby immigrants from Hong Kong and Taiwan. Second, Taiwan’s political system\nSection 6\n88\ntransitioned from an authoritarian state to a democracy, leading to new calls from\nthe island and from some of its immigrants in the United States for an independent\nTaiwan. Seeking to capitalize on the ever-larger number of mainlanders in the United\nStates and to battle the nascent Taiwan independence movement, PRC authorities\nestablished organizations and Chinese-language schools to bolster their propaganda\nwork in the United States. The Party’s United Front Work Department founded the\nChina Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification in 1988, and\nwithin a decade it had more than one hundred chapters in sixty countries, including\nmore than a dozen offices in the United States. Chinese officials described Chineselanguage\nmedia, Chinese-language schools, and Chinese-backed organizations as the\n“three treasures” ( 三宝 )of united front work overseas. 33\nChinese-language media. By the mid-1990s, analyst He Qinglian estimated that, of\nthe some one hundred Chinese-language newspapers in the United States, more than\none-third were funded by money from the mainland. 34 Owners of these newspapers,\nseeking subsidies from Beijing, cozied up to PRC authorities with statements such as\n“opposing Taiwan independence and fostering peaceful unification are the glorious\nmissions and historical responsibility of overseas Chinese publications.” 35\nBeijing also moved to take control of online and social media outlets. Wenxuecheng\n( 文学城 , http://wenxuecheng​. com) is the most popular Chinese-language website\nin the United States. Launched in 1997 by a group of students from the University\nof Michigan, the website was sold in 2003 to a Taiwanese-American businessman 36\nwith investments in China. Since being purchased, Wenxuecheng has signed deals\nto run news from Xinhua and the China Daily. 37 There is even an unsubstantiated\nrumor that the purchase of the website was subsidized by $1 million from the CCP\nPropaganda Department.\nDuowei is another online source that was for years an independent Chinese-language\nmedia outlet. Among its many scoops was the prediction of the composition of the\nsixteenth Politburo Standing Committee. But in 2009, Duowei was purchased by a\nHong Kong businessman 38 with substantial business interests in China, including two\ncompanies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The businessman is a founding\nmember of the Tsinghua University Center for US-China Relations and is also fond\nof writing pro-Beijing essays on China’s claims to the South China Sea. Duowei is\nnow headquartered in Beijing. Indeed, since selling Duowei, the online news source’s\nfounder 39 has moved to Mingjing (Mirror Media), a Chinese-language web presence\nMedia\n89\nbased in Canada, where he indicated that last year he received a large investment from\nthe PRC. Since then, Mingjing has significantly modified its editorial stance, switching\nits focus from politics to real estate, immigration, and investing. Part of the reason\nfor this modification appears linked to the disappearance in China of the wife of\none of Mingjing’s reporters after Mingjing aired interviews with a dissident Chinese\nbusinessman. 40\nBeijing has also moved to tighten the ideological consistency for these papers. In 2001,\nthe Office of Overseas Chinese Affairs and the China News Service began a biannual\nconference, the Forum on the Global Chinese Language Media, hosting representatives\nfrom hundreds of Chinese-language periodicals from around the world. Kicking off\nthe first conference in 2001, Guo Zhaojin, the president of the China News Service,\nsaid a key goal of the meeting was to persuade participating Overseas Chinese media\nto use copy from the China News Service instead of reports from competing Chineselanguage\nnews services from Taiwan or from the West. 41 The conference also appears\nto serve as a platform for Beijing to convince critics to modify their tone and to ensure\nthat overseas Chinese-language newspapers follow the Party’s line. Essays released\nduring the conferences praised the censorship of views opposed by the Party and\nstressed the necessity of, in the words of one piece in 2015, “properly telling China’s story”\n(echoing Xi Jinping’s instructions).\nAnd Beijing’s efforts have had some successes. Ranked the number-five Chinese website\nin the United States, http://backchina​. com was once an independent media voice like\nDuowei. But in 2017, its editors attended the ninth forum in China, and since then\nbackchina’s reporting has become far more positive about the PRC.\nIn 2006, the China News Service started holding an Advanced Seminar for the Overseas\nChinese Language Media, for select groups of editors and reporters from overseas;\na seminar in 2006, for example, focused on the correct reading of “socialism with\nChinese characteristics,” while a workshop in 2010 concerned China’s policies in Tibet\nand Xinjiang. At the thirteenth Seminar in 2015, He Yafei, then the assistant director\nof the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, argued that overseas Chinese media needed to\npromote the Belt and Road Initiative and essentially embrace the role of becoming a\nmouthpiece of the CCP promoting China’s national strategy. 42 Beijing also dispatched\nChinese officials overseas to instruct Chinese-language media on how to “correctly”\nreport the news. As the Beijing 2008 Olympics approached, Politburo member and\nhead of China’s Olympic Committee Liu Qi met at the PRC consulate in New York\nSection 6\n90\nwith representatives of the Chinese-language press to lay out China’s demands for their\ncoverage of the event. 43\nIn a further effort to control the overseas Chinese press, the China News Service\nestablished the China News Service Overseas Center, which provides news reports,\neditorials, and layout for overseas Chinese media outlets around the globe. The idea\nbehind the center was that if Beijing were to provide and package content for overseas\nChinese papers, and could convince them to run it, Beijing would then completely\ncontrol the message. 44\nGiven these efforts by Beijing, the space for truly independent Chinese-language media in\nthe United States has shrunk to a few media outlets supported by the adherents of Falun\nGong, the banned religious sect in China, and a small publication and website called\nVision Times. According to the publisher of its New York edition, Peter Wang, Vision Times\nwas formed expressly to address the issue of the shrinking space for independent Chinese\nvoices in the United States. Since then, it has focused on two areas—human rights\nreporting and traditional Chinese culture. Wang noted that while some of the staff of\nthe paper may be Falun Gong adherents, the paper is not a Falun Gong operation. Vision\nTimes began its online presence in 2001, started printing a newspaper in 2005, and claims\na circulation in the United States and Canada of below 60,000. 45\nWeChat as a Source of News in the Diaspora Community\nChina’s social media giant, WeChat, is another major source of news within the\nChinese American community. But it is more than that; for many users in the United\nStates, China, and around the world, WeChat is a digital ecosystem so ubiquitous that it\nconstitutes a lifestyle—a drumbeat that determines the rhythms of the day. In the United\nStates, as in China, WeChat censors news and comments in accordance with rules set by\nChina’s Communist Party. In an analysis of WeChat articles popular in the United States,\nresearcher Zhang Chi found that the most successful pieces skewed significantly to the\nright of the US political spectrum. 46 Zhang noted that the right-wing view on WeChat\ngenerally embraces a social Darwinist, zero-sum conception of racial politics, with\nChinese in America portrayed as beaten down by a system that favors other racial groups\nand illegal immigrants from Latin America. One popular WeChat channel blamed the\nwildfires in 2017 in Northern California on an undocumented immigrant.\nNumerous other channels reported on alleged plans for mass riots and a civil war in the\nUnited States led by the leftist group Antifa. When a Chinese jogger was struck and killed\nMedia\n91\nin a DUI case in a suburb of Los Angeles, a popular WeChat channel reported that the\nmotorist was undocumented and had committed the act to extend his stay in the United\nStates. 47 Zhang noted that another cause of concern was the fact that these WeChat\nchannels helped foster anxiety among first-generation Chinese. As with other Chinese\nimmigrants who rely on traditional Chinese-language media for information, the anti-\nAmerican hothouse created by WeChat’s “news channels” leads to a type of resentful pro-\nChinese nationalism that is ripe for exploitation by the Chinese government.\nWeChat may be no more slanted in its treatment of information than American media\nthat serve domestic political extremes, but there is no precedent for the situation\nWeChat has created: A vast and vital community of Americans gets most of its “news”\nfrom, and does most of its communicating via, a platform known to be censored by a\nforeign government that opposes free speech and has been named by the US National\nSecurity Strategy as the greatest long-term security challenge the nation faces.\nWestern Media\nThe Chinese Communist Party has always recognized the usefulness of the overseas\nmedia (both in local languages and Chinese) as a means to get its message out. Foreignand\nChinese-language media have always served the cause of China’s revolution. For\nexample, in the 1930s, foreign journalist Edgar Snow sang the praises of the Chinese\nCommunist Party and specifically its chairman, Mao Zedong. The Party conducted a\ncampaign in the United States in the 1940s to turn the American public against the\nregime of Chiang Kai-shek and to soften criticism of China’s Communists. Organizations\nsuch as the Institute of Pacific Relations, which provided Americans with in-depth\ncoverage of Asia, were staffed by Communist agents and played an important role in\nfashioning public opinion on America’s relations with China. To be sure, these techniques\nwere not unique to the Chinese Communist Party. The government of Chiang Kai-shek\nand its “China lobby” also used the overseas press to serve its purposes. In the 1950s,\nthe KMT government conducted a campaign against pro-Communist newspapers in the\nUnited States, convincing the US government to shutter several pro-PRC outlets and expel\npro-PRC journalists.\nThe events of 1989 sparked a significant change in China’s foreign propaganda campaign.\nFollowing China’s crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing and other\ncities, China’s image sank to a low not seen by Chinese officials in decades. 48 China\nBooks and Periodicals, which had been operating in the United States since the 1950s,\nclosed its offices on Fifth Avenue in New York City. And the Foreign Languages Press\nSection 6\n92\n(a department of the China International Publishing Group) saw its cooperative\nagreements dwindle.\nIt was then that Chinese officials revived an old tactic that the Communist Party\nhad employed before the revolution—using friendly foreigners and pro-PRC Chinese\nimmigrants to publicize China’s story. Chinese officials called this tactic of localizing\nthe work of foreign propaganda, the “borrowed boat” strategy. 49\nOne such friendly American was a China scholar 50 who was for years associated\nwith Random House. According to Huang Youyi, the chief editor of the Foreign\nLanguages Press posted to the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s, this\nAmerican argued that for China to improve its image in the United States, it needed to\nwork through American organizations, and so he collaborated with Huang on a book\nseries, “The Culture and Civilization of China,” which the Yale University Press began\npublishing in 1997. The American’s “understanding of the US publishing industry and\nhis friendly attitude towards China became an indispensable condition for the success\nof the cooperation,” Huang wrote. 51 Books from the series are still given to foreign\nguests of the Beijing government.\nIn a period of deep crisis for China’s reputation, Huang’s success in using foreigners\nto publish material beneficial to China’s image became a model for other Chinese\noperations. From the early 1990s, the Chinese Communist Party began to seek\nopportunities to cooperate with Westerners, Western media and publishing companies,\nand overseas Chinese to tell its story.\nLack of Reciprocity\nIt is important to compare Beijing’s efforts to “grab the right to speak” and obtain\n“discourse power” overseas with the efforts, and ability, of Western media organizations\nto access China’s market to a similar degree. For decades, those efforts have faced\nroadblocks placed in their path by the Chinese government. A key roadblock has been\nChina’s ban on Western investment in media except when it involves such things as\nfashion, cars, and lifestyle.\nPrivate media\nUnlike the United States, where Chinese reporters are only restricted from entering\nhigh-security military installations, Western reporters in China are subject to a panoply\nMedia\n93\nof regulations, many of them unwritten. A 2017 report by the Foreign Correspondents’\nClub of China notes that in a survey of 117 foreign journalists based in China,\n40 percent felt reporting conditions had deteriorated compared to 2016, nearly half said\nthey had experienced harassment, interference, and physical violence during their work\nin China, while 15 percent said they encountered difficulties during their visa renewal\nprocess and over 25 percent said they had learned that Chinese contacts had been\ndetained and otherwise hounded by Chinese authorities for speaking with them. 52\nChina has also moved against Western media outlets on many fronts. Both Chineseand\nEnglish-language websites of the New York Times have been blocked in China since\n2012 following a story detailing the wealth of the family of China’s then premier Wen\nJiabao. 53 The English- and Chinese-language sites of the Wall Street Journal and Reuters\nare also blocked, and those belonging to the Financial Times and the Economist are\nblocked on an intermittent basis.\nThe Chinese government has also made it difficult for resident foreign reporters to\nobtain and renew journalist visas. Following the New York Times’ report on Wen’s\nfamily money, China did not approve a new journalist visa for a Times reporter for\nthree years. While the situation has improved somewhat since 2015 for resident\njournalists, the Chinese government still delays visa applications for journalists and\nuses the threat of expulsion from China as a way to pressure Western media outlets\nto soften their coverage of China. This is especially true of freelance journalists or\nindependent documentary filmmakers who are dependent on onetime visas to carry\nout a specific assignment. Here delays and outright refusal to process visas in a timely\nmanner have been common.\nThere is some indication that China’s pressure tactics have paid off. In 2013,\nBloomberg News was preparing to publish a report detailing connections between one\nof China’s richest men and members of the Politburo—the top organ in the Chinese\nCommunist Party, when Bloomberg spiked the story. The outlet’s editor in chief,\nMatthew Winkler, was quoted on a conference call likening the decision to censorship\nof foreign news bureaus that wanted to continue to report in Nazi Germany. 54 Other\nobservers noted that the real reason Bloomberg News killed the story involved the\ncompany’s substantial business interests—especially in “Bloomberg Boxes” selling\naccess to financial information—in China. Indeed, the organization’s founder\nrecently doubled down on China and now even headlines a new forum focusing on\nChina’s global influence with a state-owned Chinese partner. 55 (Interestingly, the\nSection 6\n94\nNovember 2018 gathering in Beijing was cancelled by Beijing and forced to move to\nSingapore.)\nInternational service broadcasters\nAnother roadblock has been China’s efforts to limit the influence of the Mandarin\nservices of the Voice of America and Radio Free Asia. Starting in the first decade of the\n2000s, the Chinese embassy in Washington, DC, and the leadership of VOA’s Mandarin\nservice began an annual meeting to allow embassy officials to voice their opinions\nabout VOA’s content. PRC embassy officials have also reached out to VOA hosts to\nconvince them to be more supportive of the regime. VOA personalities have hosted\nevents at the embassy. One of VOA’s TV editors even publicly pledged his allegiance\nto China at an embassy event. 56 It is not surprising, then, that some VOA staffers\ninterviewed for this report believe that China’s outreach campaign has succeeded in\npushing the VOA Mandarin service away from programs with direct relevance to China\ntoward programming that seeks instead to highlight American everyday life or teach\nAmerican-style English to Chinese listeners. An example would be a program called\nCultural Odyssey, a VOA TV series that focused on Americana, such as fried chicken,\ndoughnuts, and national parks. For years, Cultural Odyssey ate up one-third of the\nMandarin service’s travel budget. Another program featured English teacher Jessica\nBeinecke, which launched her on a career as an English-teaching TV personality on\nmainland China itself. VOA officials internally praised these programs as both “nonpolitical\nand non-sensitive,” a current senior VOA staff member noted. What’s more,\nVOA officials sought to scale back what were perceived to be sensitive reports. After\nrunning two years of a radio series on aspects of modern Chinese history, including the\nCultural Revolution and other events post-1949, VOA cut the program in 2009 despite\nseveral of those shows garnering well over three million hits each on the web. In 2011,\nthe Broadcasting Board of Governors sought to cut 65 percent of the workforce from\nthe Mandarin service. However, reporters and editors in the service fought back, they\nlobbied Congress, and the cuts were restored. In 2012, a Chinese immigrant, who was\nalso a former Chinese dissident and a specialist on the US political system, became\nthe first female Chinese head of the service. She was later fired over a controversial\ninterview that drew the official ire of the PRC, which threatened repercussions. 57\nSince her dismissal, VOA’s Mandarin service has resumed a pattern of avoiding stories\nthat could be perceived to be too tough on China, according to several staffers. For\nexample, blogs written by dissidents such as Cao Yaxue, who runs the human rights–\nMedia\n95\nrelated http://chinachange​. org site, have been removed from the VOA website. Several\nprominent Chinese commentators are no longer on VOA’s lineup of analysts. Many\nstaffers now describe VOA’s content as neither pro- nor anti-China. The emphasis, the\nstaffers observed, is on travel, culture and language, programming the likes of which\nChinese viewers can access equally well on CGTN or China’s internet. By contrast, the\ncontent of Radio Free Asia remains far more hard-hitting than its counterpart, VOA.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nChina has used America’s openness to convey its message both to English- and\nChinese-speaking residents of the United States. US rules allow foreign media\ncompanies, even ones run by foreign governments, to broadcast freely via American\ncable and satellite networks. Unlike in China, the United States government does\nnot block any Chinese websites, many of which are funded by the PRC government.\nWhile the Communications Act of 1934 theoretically only allows foreigners to own\n20 to 25 percent of terrestrial wireless radio and TV stations, the law has been loosened\nconsiderably over the past decade, and it does not even apply to cable channels or leasing\narrangements wherein a foreign entity, including one owned by a foreign government,\ncan pay an American licensee for airtime. Chinese media outlets have used all such\nstrategies to publicize the views of the Beijing government. 58 Perhaps more worrisome,\nChina has also been successful in funding or convincing pro-PRC businessmen to fund\npro-PRC media outlets in the United States that nominally appear independent so that\nthe three most important traditionally independent Chinese-language newspapers now\nincreasingly side with Beijing.\nBy contrast, the Chinese government severely limits the scope of US and other Western\nmedia outlets in China and has banned Western media investment in China, except in\nvery limited innocuous areas, such as in fashion, automobiles, investing, health, and\nlifestyle. The idea that a Western TV news network could lease a Chinese station and\nbroadcast news to China around the clock—as their Chinese counterparts do here in\nthe United States—is not even thinkable. Equally, there is no chance that a Western\nmedia company would be allowed to invest in a Chinese publication that reported\nmainstream news.\nBoth the expansion of Chinese state-owned English-language media in the United\nStates and Beijing’s increasing control of Chinese-language media outlets in the United\nStates are very problematic for an open dialogue. For one, these media are under the\nSection 6\n96\ncontrol of a foreign government, not simply a foreign individual or firm. Second,\nthe diminishing space within America’s Chinese-language media for independent\nvoices runs counter to the goals of a liberal society seeking a diversity of perspectives.\nFurthermore, the PRC’s control of Chinese-language media outlets in America and\nits increasingly strong position among English-language outlets provides China\nwith the potential of mobilizing Chinese Americans and Americans alike to espouse\npolicies counter to US interest. The constant drumbeat of anti-American reporting\nin pro-Beijing media outlets headquartered in the United States creates an unhealthy\nenvironment.\nPromoting Transparency\nA major challenge is the fact that China has worked successfully to mask its influence\noperations with respect to US media. On paper, for example, the Asian Culture and\nMedia Group controls the pro-China SinoVision and Qiaobao as a private company.\nThe reality is that it is staffed by people who served the state-run China News Service\nand were, sources insist, dispatched to the United States by the Chinese government\nto establish propaganda operations in the United States. Given its nominal status\nas a private company, taking action to shut down its operations would be fraught\nwith even more legal and ethical challenges than those involving media corporations\ndirectly owned by the PRC. The same holds true for publications and websites that\nwere once independent but have now increasingly fallen under the sway of the PRC. If\nUS law protects the rights of publishers of newspapers or websites to put their personal\npolitical imprint on their enterprises, how can the US government move to deny it to\nthose of a pro-PRC bent?\nAt a minimum, what US authorities can do is work to establish the real ownership\nstructure of Chinese (and other foreign) companies purchasing US-based media. Any\nforeign-owned or foreign-controlled media (including print media), and particularly\nthose that advance a foreign government line, should be required to register under the\nForeign Agents Registration Act (FARA).\nBeyond FARA, there should also be a review to see whether these organizations and\ntheir employees should also register under existing lobbying laws as foreign agents.\nIn addition, there is an argument to be made to ensure that employees of these\norganizations should be given a disclosure package making them aware that they are\nworking for a foreign agent institution.\nMedia\n97\nPromoting Integrity\nFiguring out how to properly counter the PRC’s influence operations in both\nEnglish- and Chinese-language media presents enormous challenges in a free society.\nThe United States could consider restrictions on state-controlled media outlets,\nwhich would not include publicly funded broadcasters, such as the BBC, which\nmaintain editorial independence. Failing that, the recent requirement that state-run\npublications, TV and radio broadcasters, and potentially their employees, register as\nagents of a foreign government is a partial solution. 59 And in late 2017, Russia’s RT\nregistered as a foreign agent 60 while in September 2018, the US Justice Department\nreportedly also ordered CGTN and Xinhua to register as agents of a foreign power. 61\nWhen it comes to independent Chinese-language media, the US government should\nconsider doing more to help such independent outlets survive, including using\ngrants via the Fulbright program or other vehicles, such as the State Department\nInternational Visitors or Speakers’ Bureau. Domestically, the US government could also\nconsider aiding the operations of independent Chinese-language media, including\nmanufacturing credits for printing press operations, and nonprofit tax designations\nto allow journalism business models to survive the current transitional crisis. Private\ncharitable foundations can also make a difference in helping independent Chineselanguage\nmedia remain editorially independent and financially viable.\nPromoting Reciprocity\nThe time has come for the US government to demand reciprocity for American\njournalists attempting to do their professional work in China. To the extent that they\nare prevented from doing so as a result of visa denials and restrictions of access, the US\nState Department should respond in kind by restricting visas and access for Chinese\njournalists in the United States. To the extent that American journalists experience\nharassment and physical violence, this should also have a bearing on the granting of\nvisas and access to Chinese journalists.\nNOTES\n1 ​He Qinglian has written the most detailed study of the Chinese-language media landscape in the United\nStates.

May 15, 2018. https://prn​.to​/2OCNvbR.\n56 ​Interview with VOA staff.\n57 ​As head of this VOA service, Sasha Gong pared down the budget for Cultural Odyssey and reapproved\nfunding for more hard-hitting pieces on modern Chinese history and a program, Histories Mysteries, was\nstarted. With its reports on the famine during the Great Leap Forward, the suppression of the Falun Gong\nreligious sect of 2001, and the June 4th crackdown on pro-democracy protesters of 1989, the program\nbecame popular among viewers in China. However, Gong’s time at the head of the service ended in 2017,\nafter she and VOA management had a falling-out over an interview VOA was doing with Chinese billionaire\ndissident Guo Wengui. Gong had arranged the interview to air on VOA’s TV channel on April 19, 2017. VOA\nadvertised the interview, which was going to be live, on its website beforehand. Prior to the interview,\nhowever, the Chinese government warned VOA’s correspondent in Beijing of serious repercussions should\nthe interview air. Chinese embassy officials also contacted VOA in Washington threatening retribution.\nDespite concern from VOA’s management, Gong went ahead with the interview. While circumstances\nMedia\n101\nsurrounding what happened next are murky, VOA’s management ended up pulling the plug on the interview\nin the middle of a live broadcast. Gong and several other employees were suspended and subsequently\nfired for insubordination. Gong is contesting her dismissal through the Broadcasting Board of Governors,\nwhile VOA management denies that it was responding to Chinese pressure to stop the interview or\nfire Gong.\nChinese authorities have used both a charm offensive and tougher tactics to deal with both VOA and\nRadio Free Asia. China’s retaliation goes far beyond trying to block their transmissions into China. Security\nofficials from the PRC government have been involved in a campaign of intimidation against some VOA\nand RFA staffers and their family members. In early 2018, relatives of some Uighur reporters on Radio Free\nAsia were detained by Chinese authorities in Xinjiang province. VOA’s Mandarin service has approximately\none hundred employees. Although many of them write under pseudonyms, it appears that Chinese state\nsecurity knows who they are. Five Chinese staff members interviewed for this report said that while visiting\nfamily in China they had been contacted by representatives from state security who have impressed upon\nthem the necessity to change how they have reported on China. In one case, a young woman who is in\nthe United States on a journalist visa and who does not yet have American citizenship was threatened\nwith imprisonment during a visit last year to China if she did not reveal the names of her editors. She did\nso. In some cases, those affected have contacted the security department at the Broadcasting Board of\nGovernors. In other cases, worried about potential Chinese retribution against family members still in\nChina, they have not.\n58 ​Interview with FCC official.\n59 ​O’Keeffe, Kate and Aruna Viswanatha. “Justice Department Has Ordered Key Chinese State Media\nFirms to Register as Foreign Agents.” Wall Street Journal.

Foreign leverage over American\ncorporations can thus advance important strategic interests of the country in question.\nIn addition, as Chinese corporations go abroad, they, too, bring with them the potential\nof being leveraged by the Chinese government to advance China’s interests. This section\nexamines improper influence in the US corporate sector, as well as the potential for future\ninfluence because of significant economic exposure to China.\nThe US-China economic relationship is large and multifaceted. Trade statistics illustrate just\none aspect of this tangled web: In 2017, the United States exported goods worth $130 billion\nto China, while importing goods worth $505 billion. 1 With trade also comes extensive\nforeign investment, as well as significant levels of employment of each country’s citizens.\nSince 2000, the cumulative value of Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in the United\nStates has exceeded $140 billion, with US investment in China being more than double\nthat amount. 2 In the United States, there is more Chinese investment in the real estate\nsector than any other area. But until recently more deals are being done in the information\ntechnology sector, which has attracted the growing attention of the Committee on Foreign\nInvestment in the United States (CFIUS).\nChina is increasingly willing to engage in aggressive forms of economic statecraft. 3\nThis includes not just denial of access to, or harassment in, China’s own market, but\nalso targeting of other countries’ domestic economies and companies. These actions are\nsometimes state-led; at other times China’s state-run media will encourage “consumer-led”\nboycotts (as in the cases of Japan, Norway, and South Korea, among others). 4 Chinese\ncorporations abroad are all well aware of Chinese official policy and understand the value\nof acting in support of their country’s foreign or industrial policy objectives. China’s\ngrowing commercial presence in other countries’ economies strengthens its ability to\npotentially influence their politics.\nThis section examines corporate sector influence through three lenses: (1) the use of\nbusiness-related United Front organizations in the United States; (2) Chinese companies\noperating in America; and (3) Chinese pressuring and manipulation of American\ncompanies as vectors of influence. All three approaches are cause for concern, yet\nthe pressuring manipulation of American corporations has generally attracted less\nattention.\n104\nThis section intends to highlight three main developments. First, China is supporting\nan increasing number of local chambers of commerce in the United States with direct\nties to CCP officials. Second, as Chinese companies have become more global, they\nhave also grown more sophisticated in their efforts to socialize and localize\nthemselves in their new American communities, but also acquire political influence\nin the United States. Finally, China increased its efforts to pressure, co-opt and sometimes\neven coerce foreign corporations with the aim of influencing politics in their home\ncountries.\nThe Use of Business-Related United Front Organizations\nConsistent with the practice of other nations, major Chinese firms operating in America\nare represented by a chamber of commerce network. Analysis detailed below suggests\nthat China also operates an extensive list of United Front organizations purporting to\nbe regional chambers of commerce. China’s public-facing chamber in the United States\nis known as the China General Chamber of Commerce (CGCC), which was founded in\n2005. It is headquartered in New York with five regional operations in Chicago, Houston,\nLos Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, DC. Its website states that it has 1,500 member\ncompanies, both Chinese and non-Chinese. The organization’s chair is Bank of China USA\npresident and CEO Xu Chen. Its website lists more than sixty individuals, many from stateowned\ncompanies, in governance roles; its website lists a staff of nine.\nConsistent with business organizations of other countries, the CGCC engages in a mix\nof political engagement with its host and home countries (e.g., testifying at the US\nInternational Trade Commission 5 and hosting officials from the Chinese Ministry of\nCommerce 6 ); informational activities for its members (e.g., a lunch-and-learn on labor\nand safety issues in the United States); 7 and promotional activities (e.g., dinner galas and\ncharity events). The CGCC is actively engaged with senior American political and business\nleaders. In July 2017, it hosted a welcome luncheon at the National Governors Association\nmeeting in Rhode Island, at which the governors of Maryland, Kentucky, Alaska, Arizona,\nLouisiana, and Rhode Island attended. In September 2017, the group organized the visit of\nthe governors of Alaska and Missouri to China. 8\nInconsistent with the practice of other countries, China also oversees an extensive network\nof local chambers of commerce. This raises a question of their possible ties to the Chinese\nparty-state, and whether these chambers may be misrepresenting themselves as local\nconcerns when they are instead activated by, or in liaison with, the Chinese government.\nResearch for this project has identified thirty-one business-focused organizations operating\nin the United States that are explicitly associated with or whose profiles and activities\nare highly suggestive of involvement with United Front work. 9 Most of these groups are\nconcentrated in Greater Los Angeles and New York City, two principal communities of the\nChinese diaspora. They are typically organized by hometown province of origin. This count\nCorporations\n105\ndoes not include many other professional diaspora groups that may be used to facilitate\nChina’s influence operations.\nSuch Chinese groups have increased their activity in the United States since 2015, 10 and\nmany of these groups have had interactions with the United Front Work Department and\nother Chinese officials both in the United States and in China, contacts that are distinctly\ndifferent from invitations to embassy or consular diplomats and bear further scrutiny. 11\nAt least eleven of the chambers identified in this\nanalysis were established in 2016 or later, consistent\nwith heightened activity observed in other sectors\nof society dedicated to projecting China’s soft power\nand influence abroad. (Tellingly, China’s spending\non diplomacy has doubled to $9.5b per year under\nXi Jinping.) 12 The US-Zhejiang General Chamber of\nCommerce’s WeChat description explicitly references\na 2015 provincial directive on strengthening the\nprovince’s overseas Chinese connections (see\nscreenshot). Many of these groups maintain their\nown presence, via a website or, increasingly, the\nWeChat social media platform. In one instance, our\nresearcher’s antivirus software blocked an intrusion\nattempt while researching the US-Fujian Chamber of\nCommerce.\nChinese Companies Operating in America as a Vector of Influence\nMore than 3,200 Chinese-owned companies operate in the United States, employing\n140,000 Americans. 13 Chinese establishments operate in all but ten congressional districts. 14\nAs Chinese companies’ presence in the US economy grows, given the United Front’s\npenchant for using civil society organizations for its purposes, they bring with them several\npotential risks. First, their potential to be used by Beijing may result in activities that are\ncontrary to US interests, as evidenced by intense scrutiny of their investment activities by\nCFIUS and reported warnings by counterintelligence officials. Second, growing access to the\nUS political system, even if currently used to advance legitimate economic interests, creates\nopenings for future exploitation by the Chinese government. Third, Chinese companies\nmay effectively “export” corrupt or unethical business practices.\nActivities Contrary to US Interests\nThe technology sector has been the most consistent and prominent source of concern.\nIn 2012, the Intelligence Committee of the US House of Representatives declared\nChinese technology companies Huawei and ZTE a national security threat given the\nfirms’ alleged ties to the Chinese military and the potential for their technology to\nSection 7\n106\nbe exploited for espionage or cyberattacks. 15 Both companies were key providers of\ntechnology at the African Union headquarters building, where investigators have\nfound widespread electronic infiltration traceable to China, whose state-owned firms\nconstructed the building. 16 Both Huawei and ZTE have also been accused of bribery\nabroad to win contracts. 17\nFor years, the federal government has actively discouraged American companies, local\ngovernments, and allied countries from partnering with Huawei. Nonetheless, the\ncompany’s global presence has continued to grow, and it is playing an important role in\nsetting standards for 5G wireless technology. 18 In April 2018, the United States announced\nsanctions against ZTE for violating restrictions on sales to Iran and North Korea, barring\nAmerican companies from transacting with the company. This would have effectively put\nZTE out of business because of its dependence on American inputs, but shortly thereafter,\nand against the objections of many in Congress, the Trump administration agreed to a\nsettlement that would allow the firm to stay in business.\nThere are other instances of companies being used to advance objectives contrary to the\nUS interest. For example, front companies have been used to aid in the illegal export of\nsensitive technologies to China. In another instance, Newsweek in 2016 reported that\nthe United States was investigating the acquisition by the Chinese company Fosun of\na US insurer that has sold legal liability insurance to senior American intelligence\nofficials. 19\nGrowing Access to the US Political System\nAlthough federal campaign contributions by foreign nationals or companies are illegal in\nUS federal elections, there are alternative avenues for foreign corporate interests to influence\nthe US political system, as the Australians have learned. These include lobbying, indirect\ncampaign contributions via US subsidiaries, and the hiring of former senior government\nofficials. All these approaches, while currently legal, are discussed below to demonstrate the\nfull spectrum of activities Chinese entities are involved with and to highlight where they\nmay raise questions of impropriety.\nLobbying The most direct and legal route to the American political system is lobbying.\nFor example, within one day of President Trump tweeting his openness to a settlement\nwith ZTE Corporation that would keep it from going out of business, the company signed\na contract with lobbying firm, Mercury Public Affairs. The lead on the ZTE account was\nBryan Lanza, a former Trump campaign official. 20 Also in 2018, the former senior advisor\nto Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross was hired as chief of International Corporate\nAffairs for another Chinese firm, HNA. Both instances underscore the need for updated\nrevolving-door policies, particularly with respect to foreign corporations that are subject to\nsignificant state control. 21\nCorporations\n107\nAll told, major Chinese companies publicly acknowledge spending $3.8 million on\nfederal lobbying in 2017 and $20.2 million in total since 2000, 22 modest amounts by\nglobal standards. The Chinese e-commerce behemoth, Alibaba, was the largest source of\nexpenditures in 2017, accounting for $2 million, followed by technology company ZTE\n($510k), Sinopec ($384k), 23 and the Wanda America Group ($300k), affiliated with Dalian\nWanda. 24 More difficult to track is Chinese corporate participation in American trade\nassociations. In early 2018, two Chinese companies have joined two major lobbying groups\nnoted for their political heft. 25\nIndirect Donations A key exception to the ban on foreign federal campaign contributions\nis permitted through activity conducted via a US subsidiary of a foreign company.\nThe Federal Election Commission has written that “where permitted by state law, a US\nsubsidiary of a foreign national corporation may donate funds for state and local elections\nif (1) the donations derive entirely from funds generated by the subsidiaries’ US operations,\nand (2) all decisions concerning the donations, except those setting overall budget amounts,\nare made by individuals who are US citizens or permanent residents.”\nThis exception inherently creates the potential for exploitation, particularly given the\nintrinsic difficulties of monitoring and enforcement. For example, the Intercept has reported\nthat American Pacific International Capital (APIC), an American subsidiary of a corporation\nowned by a Chinese citizen, contributed $1.3 million to the Super PAC of presidential\ncandidate Jeb Bush on the advice of a prominent Republican campaign finance lawyer. 26\n(Neil Bush, the brother of George W. and Jeb Bush, and former ambassador Gary Locke have\nserved as advisors of American Pacific International.) 27\nEmployees of Chinese enterprises, who in making the donations are presumably American\ncitizens, are also active donors. A review of campaign donation data finds that several\nindividuals cited as members of the China General Chamber of Commerce or employed\nby member firms have made recent campaign contributions. For example, two individuals\nassociated with HNA Group, including Tan Xiandong, the group’s president, in 2017\ndonated $2,500 each to the congressional campaign of Greg Pence, the brother of the vice\npresident. 28\nIn May 2018, China-based companies reportedly invited Chinese to attend several\nRepublican Party fund-raising dinners at which President Trump would appear. The\ninvitations prominently featured the Republican Party’s logo along with that of\nChina Construction Bank, making it appear as if there was some formal connection. 29\nThe Republican Party and China Construction Bank both denied awareness of the\nsolicitations in their name. Foreigners may attend fund-raisers so long as they do not pay\ntheir own entry, another instance in which the fungibility of money makes it easy to\nskirt this rule.\nSection 7\n108\nHiring of Former Senior Government Officials In other countries (such as Australia, UK,\nFrance, and Germany), former senior government officials routinely take positions with\nChinese companies. This pattern appears less pronounced in the United States. A prominent\nexception is the law firm Dentons, which merged with the Chinese law firm Dacheng in\n2015 30 and employs numerous former government officials, including former ambassadors,\nmembers of Congress, mayors, and generals. 31\nEarlier in 2018, Bloomberg News reported on the Imperial Pacific casino, a Chinese-owned\ncompany operating in the American territory of Saipan. Its large transaction volumes have\nraised concerns about potential money laundering. It has also made millions of payments to\nfamily members of the territory’s governor and, at one time, counted the former governors\nof three states as well as the former directors of the CIA and FBI as members of its board or\nadvisors. 32\nState and Local Politics Many states do not have prohibitions against foreign contributions\nin local races. 33 One of the most notable examples of an individual contributor comes\nfrom Virginia, where in 2013 and 2014, Wang Wenliang, a Chinese industrialist who was\nexpelled from China’s national legislature in 2016, contributed $120,000 to Governor Terry\nMcAuliffe’s campaign. 34\nChinese firms are also involved in lobbying at the state and local level, another means\nof acquiring legitimate influence. While the quality of data reporting and aggregation\nfor local and state-level lobbying is not always as robust as that at the federal level, this\nproject was able to identify more than $1 million in state-level lobbying expenses over the\npast decade by Chinese firms. BYD Motors, which produces buses for public transit in the\nUnited States, Huawei, and Wanda America Group were among the biggest spenders on\nlobbying.\nA 2017 complaint with the Federal Election Commission against the California subsidiary\nof Dalian Wanda is illustrative of the potential for exploitation granted by the USsubsidiary\nexception. The FEC found that Lakeshore, a Chicago real estate company\nwhose principals are US citizens, was the source of the money that funded a local ballot\ninitiative in California that would have blocked a Wanda competitor from expanding.\nWanda acknowledged that the money for the measure had come from Lakeshore, with\nwhich Wanda does business, in the form of a $1.2 million loan. In its conclusion, the\nFEC did not rule on whether foreign restrictions applied to ballot measure activity.\nFurther, it argued that even if those restrictions did apply, because “none of the funds\nat issue appear to originate with a foreign national” (i.e., they came from Lakeshore);\nthat because the Wanda deputy manager who was listed as the principal officer of the\nBallot Measure Committee was an American citizen (the general manager is a Chinese\nnational); and that the funds originated in and would be paid back by revenues generated\nCorporations\n109\nin the United States, the activity was not in violation of laws against foreign campaign\nactivity. 35\n“Exporting” Corrupt or Unethical Business Practices\nChina scores poorly on international indices of corruption. 36 As Chinese companies\nexpand abroad, it is possible that they could have a deleterious effect simply by exporting\nsuspect business practices. An industry of particular importance is banking. The “big four”\nChinese banks all operate in the United States, where their assets have increased sevenfold\nbetween 2010 and 2016 to $126.5 billion. 37 They are often extensively involved in real estate\ntransactions of Chinese firms operating in the United States. In 2015, 2016, and 2018, China\nConstruction Bank, 38 the Agricultural Bank of China, 39 and Industrial & Commercial Bank\nof China 40 were respectively subject to enforcement action by the Federal Reserve for not\ndoing enough to fight money laundering.\nChinese corporations in the United States can also hinder the rule of law in other ways.\nWhen responding to lawsuits in US courts, Chinese state-owned enterprises have claimed\nexemption due to sovereign immunity; in other instances, Chinese firms with an American\nlegal presence have refused to comply with US investigations by claiming that cooperation\nwould violate Chinese law. 41 These actions inhibit the ability of the US government to\nregulate commerce and put American competitors at a disadvantage within their own\ncountry.\nChinese Manipulation of American Companies as a Vector of Influence 42\nAmerican companies play a significant role in American foreign and domestic politics and\ntheir leaders regularly are selected to take positions of leadership in government. As a result,\ncorporate America’s traditional role in favor of engagement with China, given the country’s\nmarket potential, has had significant weight in American policy toward the country. 43\nChina, for its part, welcomed foreign companies’ investment as part of its policy of reform\nand opening up in the hope of spurring economic development.\nChina’s relationship with corporate America has become increasingly fraught. In this report\nand elsewhere, China’s state-directed efforts to facilitate the theft of intellectual property,\nthe lifeblood of developed economies, are well documented. China’s forced transfer of\ntechnology by foreign firms, as a condition of operating in China, is one of the main\ncomplaints of both the Trump administration and the European Union.\nBut China’s ability to pressure US companies also encompasses three other more elusive\ndimensions. First, recognizing the importance of American companies in American\npolitics, China has frequently cultivated, even leveraged, American executives to\nlobby against policies it opposes. Where cultivation fails, it has threatened or exercised\nSection 7\n110\neconomic retaliation. For example, in June 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported that Xi\nwarned a group of global CEOs that China would retaliate with “qualitative measures”\ntargeted at their companies, if the United States did not back off from the tariff war. 44\nSecond, China is seeking to pressure American companies into legitimizing its geopolitical\nclaims and interests, for example by demanding that Western firms overtly acknowledge\nthat Taiwan is an irreversible part of China. Third, China has wooed American companies\nwith both sticks and carrots into serving its strategic interests abroad, most notably via its\ninteractions with Hollywood.\nChina’s source of leverage over American companies comes from its large domestic market\nand its key role in international supply chains; by contrast, China holds little direct\nownership in American companies. American affiliates (i.e., those at least half-owned by\nAmerican multinational companies) employ 1.7 million Chinese workers and are indirectly\nresponsible for the employment of millions more. 45 More than fifty American companies\nreport that they generate at least 20 percent of their revenues from China. 46 Naturally,\nmany companies (and industry associations) with large stakes in China lobby the American\ngovernment on issues related to China, often seeking to exert a moderating influence on US\npolicy. This is not in itself evidence of improper influence, but it merits scrutiny and should\nbe weighed in the context of other evidence in this section. 47\nSeeking to Influence American Politics via Corporate Interests\nChina does, in fact, exert influence on how at least some American companies and\ncorporate executives interact with the American government. This influence generally\ntakes two forms. In the first, China relies on American corporations to retard efforts by the\nAmerican government to investigate and sanction Chinese behavior deemed harmful to\nnational economic or strategic interests. For example, some American corporations have\nexpressed reservations about cooperating with US trade investigations for fear of retaliation\nby China.\nChinese officials also regularly convene senior American executives at special meetings\nwith government officials or major conferences. During these engagements, Western\nCEOs’ positive comments on the country receive wide play in the foreign and domestic\nmedia, one of many ways in which the Party continues to seek the appearance of outside\nlegitimization for domestic purposes. In addition, China uses these meetings to attempt to\ncoerce American executives to take China’s side in disputes with the US government. As\nthe risk of a trade war mounted in spring 2018, Chinese officials explicitly warned gathered\nexecutives to lobby the US government to back down or risk disruption to their business\nin China. 48 The US government does not strategically convene foreign business leaders, let\nalone instruct them to use their influence to shape policy favorable to the United States in\ntheir home countries.\nCorporations\n111\nAdvancing Strategic Interests Abroad: A Case Study of Hollywood\nAs its market power mounts, China is increasingly able to leverage foreign corporations\nnot just to influence their home governments, but also to advance China’s broader\nstrategic interests around the world. The most visible manifestation of this strategy is\nthe Party-state’s effort to influence Hollywood in a bid to advance China’s global soft\npower agenda.\nAmerican popular culture has enjoyed worldwide influence for decades and is a key element of\nthe country’s soft power. However, by the end of the Hu Jintao era, China’s leaders had begun\ncalling for their country, too, to become a soft power leader, a theme Xi Jinping has continued\nto stress. The subsequent surge in Chinese spending on entertainment, or its “cultural\nindustries,” 49 as it calls this sector, amid flat revenues in the United States, has made China’s\nmarket a compelling one for Hollywood, despite continued quotas limiting the number\nforeign films that can be shown in China. In 2017, the Chinese box office reached $7.9 billion\non growth of 21 percent, whereas the US market grew just 2 percent to $11.1 billion. 50 (Foreign\nfilms account for roughly half of China’s total, most of which is attributable to Hollywood.)\nIn the 2010s, in addition to investing in its domestic film industry and maintaining\na restrictive import regime, the Chinese government encouraged the country’s media\ncompanies to enter into alliances or attempt to acquire outright American entertainment\ncompanies. Collectively, these strategies have raised concerns about self-censorship, the\nco-opting of the American film industry to advance Chinese narratives, and ultimately, the\nrisk that the industry will lose its independence.\nHollywood, represented by the Motion Picture Association of America, has long cultivated\nclose ties to the American government, which it has used to open access to China. For\nexample, media scholar Aynne Kokas notes that in 2012, Vice President Joe Biden met with\nthen Chinese vice president Xi Jinping to discuss China’s quota on foreign films. 51 During\nXi’s visit, Biden also helped broker an agreement between DreamWorks and a group of\nChinese investors. Ultimately, in response to these efforts and WTO action, China increased\nits annual quota of imported films from twenty to thirty-four.\nFilm studios can attempt to circumvent the import quota by coproducing films with Chinese\npartners. This can invite censorship directly into the production process, potentially\naffecting what global audiences see, as opposed to censorship that affects only what the\nChinese market sees. 52 Examples abound of studios that have cast Chinese actors, developed\nand/or cut scenes specific to the Chinese market, or preemptively eliminated potentially\nobjectionable references to China from scripts even when source material has called for it.\nAware of the Chinese market’s growing centrality to the film industry, major studios are\nalso reluctant to produce any film that would upset China, even if that specific film was\nSection 7\n112\nnot intended for the China market, for fear that all films by the studio would be blocked.\nIndeed, the last spate of movies made for general circulation that addressed topics that the\nChinese government deemed sensitive were released in 1997 and included such productions\nas Red Corner, Seven Years in Tibet, and Kundun. Several prominent American entertainers\nhave been subject to bans by China, most often for their association with the Dalai Lama.\nIn an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, actor Richard Gere, an outspoken advocate of\nTibetan culture, stated, “There are definitely movies that I can’t be in because the Chinese\nwill say, ‘Not with him.’ ” 53\nBeyond self-censorship, American studios and creative personnel are at risk of being actively\nco-opted in advancing Chinese soft power. Chinese political and entertainment leaders are\nconscious that American entertainment companies have played an outsize role in defining\nChina, from Mulan to Kung Fu Panda. By the time the third edition in the Panda franchise\nhad been released, however, it was being coproduced with a Chinese partner. The list of\nfilms portraying China in a positive light grow each year, such as the space films Gravity\nand The Martian, a movie backed by Chinese money in which the American protagonists\nare saved by the Chinese. Ironically, in Gravity, a central plot twist involves the shooting\ndown of a satellite by the Russians. In fact, the only nation to have shot down a satellite in\nreal life is China. These positive portrayals, of course, are not inherently objectionable—\nand they may, indeed, provide a constructive countervailing force in an otherwise\ndeteriorating relationship. The issue is: How do these portrayals come to be: In other\nwords, has independent artistic vision been manipulated by political pressures to\nmaintain commercial standing?\nThe rush of Chinese investment into the American film industry has raised legitimate\nconcerns about the industry’s outright loss of independence. In 2012, Dalian Wanda\nacquired the AMC cinema chain, followed in 2016 by the acquisition of the Legendary\nEntertainment studio. Before encountering political trouble at home, Wanda’s chairman\nannounced a desire to invest in each of the six major Hollywood studios. Since then, other\nannounced partnerships and investments have faded, principally because of Beijing’s\npushback against what it deemed to be grossly excessive, and often ill-considered, foreign\ninvestment plans by Chinese companies. 54\nConclusion and Recommendations\nThrough control of its companies operating abroad, growing influence over foreign\ncompanies, and the rapid activation of business-related United Front groups, China is\nusing commercial interests as an important means of exercising “sharp power” influence.\nAs with other sectors, much of China’s activity is, regardless of its intent, legal and thus\nshould not be disparaged. The appropriate response to this commercial challenge must be\ntemperate and multifaceted. In some areas, it will require that the political system increase\nits transparency regarding or reduce its exposure to corporate money entirely, which, given\nCorporations\n113\nits fungibility, ultimately renders any distinction between domestic and foreign sources\nmeaningless. Corporations should also provide greater clarity on their financial and supply\nchain exposure to China and disclose the presence of CCP members in joint- or wholly\nowned ventures. In certain instances, new limitations on corporate activity that is harmful\nto the national interest may be required.\nAmerican business leaders should become better versed in the evolving nature of China’s\nglobal ambitions, especially in the use of United Front tactics for influencing almost all\naspects of China’s interaction with the United States. American corporations should raise\ntheir voices through chambers of commerce or other collective commercial entities that can\ncollectively represent their interests when a company confronts pressures or coercion. To more\neffectively resist growing Chinese pressures, American corporations will most certainly need\nto find new ways to cooperate more closely with each other, and at times even in coordination\nwith the US government. Like think tanks, universities, other civil society organizations,\nand media outlets, American companies will be most vulnerable to Chinese pressure when\nthey are atomized and isolated. In this sense, the challenges with which US corporations are\nconfronted by a rising authoritarian China with a far more ambitious global agenda are not so\ndissimilar to those confronted by those other sectors of American society highlighted in this\nreport. Each confronts an un-level playing field that lacks reciprocity.\nTo help rectify these imbalances, in certain instances, the US government should be the\none to coordinate collective action, as it recently sought to do with the US airline industry.\nIt may also need to be more prepared to impose reciprocal penalties on Chinese companies\nor even compensate American companies for losses when they stand up to punitive action\nfrom China as an additional incentive to maintain resolve.\nMost important, corporate executives, their boards, and their shareholders must double\ntheir efforts to exercise the kind of principled leadership and restraint that will help them\nresist the loss of corporate control in pursuit of short-term profit. This includes not only\nindividual companies but also their representative organizations, notably the US Chamber\nof Commerce, the US-China Business Council and other specific trade associations. These\nbodies not only need to promote American business interests by pushing back against\nChinese restrictions where necessary but they also need to adopt a heightened awareness of\nthe role that corporations must play in protecting both their own interests and the national\neconomic security of the United States itself.\nIn the corporate sector, China is not just taking advantage of the openness of American\nmarkets, which are rightfully a point of pride for the United States and a pillar of our\neconomic vitality, but it is also exploiting American capitalism’s short-termism. This latter\npredilection could end up being as much of a threat to the ability of American corporations\nto maintain healthy economic relations with China as Beijing’s very strategic and targeted\nUnited Front tactics.\nSection 7\n114\nNOTES\n1 ​“Trade in Goods with China.” US Census Bureau.

Starting in 2018, joint ventures operating in China have been pressured to allow internal\nCommunist Party cells an explicit role in decision making, including investment plans and personnel\nchanges. This is but one of the most explicit signals of Chinese efforts to control foreign enterprises in\nan effort to legitimize and defend its rule and other core interests, such as its claim to sovereignty over\nTaiwan. While companies must follow the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate, China uses the\nextraordinary combination of its enormous market and its authoritarianism to enforce compliance with\nlaws and norms that deviate from practice elsewhere. Companies’ decisions to comply not only affect their\nfinancial success within China, but they can also serve to legitimize these practices internationally.\nChina’s government directs significant attention toward American technology companies in an effort to\ncontrol the flow of information in Chinese society. Many of these companies’ services in China are blocked\noutright or are subject to intrusive national security reviews or other regulatory obstacles. Regardless,\nmany American companies redouble their attempted engagement with the Chinese government. But in\nSection 7\n118\ndoing so, they not only become subject to the restrictions on Chinese technology users, but they also help\nto legitimize China’s vision for “cyber-sovereignty,” an issue that has become an important ongoing global\ngovernance debate. In some cases, they may even be inadvertently advancing China’s goals for military\ntechnological superiority. American technology CEOs, including those from Google, Apple, and Cisco, are\nprominent attendees at the World Internet Conference. At one installment of the conference, a Chinese\nantiterrorism expert argued that Beijing should increase its pressure on foreign internet companies such\nas Twitter, which he argued should be punished for tweets that “defame the party, Chinese leaders, and\nrelated national strategies.” Facebook has been notably solicitous of the Chinese government in an effort\nto enter the Chinese market, reportedly developing a tool that could be used by a third party to censor\ncontent. Despite being blocked in China, Facebook nonetheless generates significant advertising revenues\nfrom Chinese companies seeking to reach foreign consumers. As it seeks to reenter the Chinese market,\nGoogle’s willingness to facilitate that country’s national artificial intelligence priorities stand in contrast\nto its decision to end limited AI cooperation with the US Department of Defense. In June 2018, Tsinghua\nannounced that Google’s AI chief would serve as an adviser to that university’s new center for artificial\nintelligence research. The company is already involved in research at Peking University and the University\nof Science and Technology of China, among others. Artificial intelligence is a declared strategic priority\nfor the Chinese government with significant military implications. The Chinese government is actively\ncoordinating the efforts of not just its universities, but also nominally private companies such as Baidu.\nCommenting on Google’s AI China Center, at which several hundred engineers are employed, former deputy\ndefense secretary Bob Work has stated, “anything that’s going on in that center is going to be used” by\nthe Chinese military. In the summer of 2018, it was reported that Google was considering reentering the\nChinese market with a censored search engine, but Chinese government officials have discounted the\nprospect and many of Google’s own employees have expressed opposition.\nChina also seeks to enlist foreign corporations to reinforce its so-called “core interests” in ways that\nhave influenced what they feel comfortable saying even outside of China. In early 2018, for example,\nforeign companies, particularly in the travel industry, were targeted for listing Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau,\nand Tibet as separate entities on their websites rather than as sovereign parts of China. The Civil Aviation\nAdministration of China sent letters to international airlines demanding that any references to these\ndestinations except as part of China be removed from their materials and websites. In May, the Trump\nadministration declared the Chinese government’s order to airlines to be “Orwellian nonsense and part\nof a growing trend by the Chinese Communist Party to impose its political views on American citizens\nand private companies” with which they might not necessarily agree. At the direction of the American\ngovernment, the airlines initially and collectively declined to follow Beijing’s orders, as the US government\nconsidered the issue a diplomatic matter to be resolved between governments. However, when China\ndeclined to negotiate with the US government over the issue, by July the airlines partially met Beijing’s\ndemands by referring only to cities.\nTargeting foreign companies’ speech extends beyond Taiwan to China’s fraught relationship with its\nethnic minorities. At Marriott, an employee responsible for managing the company’s social media accounts\nunwittingly liked a tweet by a pro-Tibet group and was fired as a result of the backlash. The company’s\nwebsite and app were blocked in China for one week, at unknown financial cost. Daimler, the German\ncar manufacturer, was similarly forced to apologize for posting a reference to the Dalai Lama, the exiled\nTibetan spiritual leader, on social media. In the latter two cases, the companies were targeted even though\nthe social services on which they were posting were blocked inside China.

In many\ndeveloping economies, multinational corporations willingly agree to skills and technology\ntransfer arrangements in exchange for the right to operate. Governments support these\nmeasures in the hopes of furthering economic development. Transfers cross the threshold\ninto illegitimacy when coercion, misappropriation, theft, or espionage are deployed with\nthe effect of undermining a company’s, and ultimately its home country’s, economic\ncompetitiveness. China’s expropriation of American technology is an example of how\nit leverages its influence among universities, corporations, and diaspora communities to\nfurther strategic objectives. This section reviews the targets of China’s expropriation efforts,\nthe state and nontraditional collectors involved, and concludes with recommendations\nfor how the United States can better defend against this phenomenon. It is important to\nnote that not all expropriation of intellectual property occurs at the explicit direction\nof the government and that China is not the sole country targeting the United States.\nNonetheless, China—whether at the level of the state or individual—is considered the\nmost serious offender.\nWhile Chinese cyberthreats and clandestine spying against the United States dominate\nthe public discourse, a far more serious threat is posed by China’s informal or “extralegal”\ntransfers of US technology and IP theft. 1 Operating under the radar, these quiet diversions\nof US technical know-how are carried out by groups and individuals in the United States,\nwhose support for China erodes America’s technological edge and ability to compete\nin international markets. These groups are managed by a professional cadre of Chinese\ngovernment and government-associated science and technology transfer specialists who\nfacilitate intellectual property “exchanges” through a maze of venues. They target specific\nadvanced technologies drawn from China’s industrial planning priorities (e.g., Made in\nChina 2025 2 ) such as semiconductors, robotics, next-generation information technologies\n(e.g., big data, smart grid, internet of things), aviation, artificial intelligence, and electric\nvehicles. As a result of their efforts, a commission convened by the National Bureau\nof Asian Research concluded that IP theft, primarily from China, costs the American\neconomy hundreds of billions of dollars each year, with significant impact on employment\nand innovation. 3 Former commander of United States Cyber Command and Director of\nthe National Security Agency General Keith Alexander was even more grave when he\nasserted the ongoing theft of IP by China represents “the greatest transfer of wealth in\nhuman history.” 4\n122\nThe Dynamics of Chinese IP Theft\nChinese nontraditional collection and IP theft is not done randomly by individuals acting\non their own. Rather, China has enacted some two dozen laws that have created a staterun\nforeign technology transfer apparatus that sponsors, for example, labs in China that\nrely wholly on information provided by compatriots working abroad. The apparatus also\nmaintains databases of foreign co-optees and distributes stipends, sinecures, and cash to\nforeign donors of high-tech innovations. In addition, the apparatus is responsible for the\ncare and feeding of agents willing to “serve China while in place” abroad.\nTargets\nChina targets all sources of American innovation, including universities, corporations,\nand government labs, exploiting both their openness and naïveté. The methods and\ntradecraft are custom-tailored to each target. For universities, China takes advantage of the\ncommitment to intellectual freedom on campus, which strongly resists government scrutiny\nof the activities of foreign students in hard science programs and international academic\ncooperation. For corporations, the lure of the China market gives Beijing tremendous\nleverage in exacting tech transfer from American firms, combined with financial incentives\nfor employees to purloin intellectual property for personal gain. Finally, US government labs\nhave a historic commitment to international scientific cooperation, and an uneven record of\nmonitoring that cooperation for unsanctioned transfers of information.\nThese efforts complement China’s legitimate efforts to invest in its own indigenous\ninnovative capacity. China has for several decades made science and technology\ndevelopment a priority and appears to have the political will to see it through. This is\ndemonstrated by the R&D funding programs it has put into place, the investment in core\nscientific infrastructure that is in some cases unparalleled anywhere else in the world, and\na national scientifically oriented industrial policy. Yet the continuing intense engagement\nin IP theft is, in many ways, an indication of the gaps in China’s indigenous innovation\nefforts.\nOnce acquired, foreign technology is converted in China into products and weapons at\n180 “Pioneering Parks for Overseas Chinese Scholars,” 160 “Innovation Service Centers,”\n276 “National Technology Model Transfer Organizations,” and an unknown number of\n“technology business incubators.” These facilities are strategically located to ensure wide\ndistribution of the foreign technologies.\nNontraditional Collectors\nNontraditional collectors include Chinese citizens, Chinese Americans with whom the\nChinese government is better able to cultivate or coerce, and other Americans. They\nrange from students to researchers. Many are willing participants, such as students from\nTechnology and Research\n123\nChinese defense universities explicitly tasked with acquiring foreign technology; others are\nnot and targeted for access to research they have pursued by their own passion and intellect.\nIndeed, some nontraditional collectors may even be unwitting in their support.\nCollectors do not appear to be chosen by Beijing for their race or nationality; rather they\nare targeted for their access to the desired intellectual property and their willingness to\nviolate their employee agreements or national laws. Indeed, more recent scholarship has\nshattered the shibboleth that the Chinese government only recruits ethnic Chinese. While\nChinese intelligence does have a historically strong track record of attempting to recruit\nethnic Chinese, primarily because of cultural and language affinity, more recent cases of\nespionage and technology transfer suggest that the Chinese government has broadened its\ntradecraft to recruit nonethnic Chinese assets and collectors as well, perhaps as a way of\ncomplicating US counterintelligence efforts.\nChina’s most systematic channel for identifying foreign-based nontraditional collectors is\nits Recruitment Program of Global Experts ( 海外高层次人才引进计划 ), commonly known as\nthe Thousand Talents Plan ( 千人计划 ) or the Thousand Talents Program (TTP). 5 The TTP is a\nmassive and sustained talent recruitment campaign designed to recruit leading experts from\noverseas to assist in the country’s modernization drive.\nInitiated in 2008, the TTP aims to recruit leading overseas scientists and experts who work\nin areas that are deemed high priority for achieving China’s modernization goals. 6 The\nprogram originally aimed to recruit 1,000 “overseas talents” ( 海外人才 ) over a period of five\nto ten years. Official Chinese TTP websites list more than three hundred US government\nresearchers and more than six hundred US corporate personnel who have accepted TTP\nmoney. 7 In many cases, these individuals do not disclose receiving the TTP money to their\nemployer, which for US government employees is illegal and for corporate personnel likely\nrepresents a conflict of interest that violates their employee agreement.\nState Collection Apparatus\nChina’s nontraditional collection relies on a web of activities, including open-source research,\nexchanges, cooperation and professional organizations, direct funding of research, strategic\nacquisition, or cyberespionage.\nOpen-source\nChina’s efforts to exploit foreign innovation is further seen in its open-source acquisition\ninfrastructure, which surpasses that of any other country. China employs a cadre of\nthousands to locate, study, and disseminate foreign journals, patents, proceedings,\ndissertations, and technical standards without regard to ownership or copyright restrictions.\nThe documents are indexed, archived, and supplied to Chinese commercial and military\n“customers.”\nSection 8\n124\nExchanges\nThe Chinese government organizes and pays for exchanges in which participants travel\nfrom the United States, divulge technical knowledge through scripted venues, are briefed\non China’s technology interests, return to their US base to collect more information, and\nrepeat the process. China has a program for what it euphemistically calls “short-term visits”\nby co-opted foreigners, which, stripped of its rhetoric, is indistinguishable from state-run\nespionage.\nCooperation organizations and advocacy groups\nMany Sino-US S&T “cooperation” organizations in the United States facilitate these transfers\nand have individual memberships of hundreds to thousands. The figure scales to some\nninety such groups worldwide. Members usually are expatriate Chinese, although China is\nexpanding its recruitment of nonethnic Chinese. One significant example of a Sino-US S&T\ncooperation organization is Triway Enterprise, Inc. ( 三立国际有限公司 ), an “external training\ninstitute” set up under the auspices of the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs\nin Falls Church, Virginia, with branches in Beijing and Nanjing. According to the Chinese\nversion of the website, the company “since 1993 has been putting its energy into promoting\nbilateral exchange and cooperation between China and the US in the fields of S&T, culture,\neducation and management with great success.” 8\nChina S&T advocacy groups in the United States declare loyalty to China and acknowledge\na “duty” to support China’s development. Members visit China to lecture, guide Chinese\ntechnical projects, transfer technologies, receive shopping lists from Chinese entities, and\nengage in other kinds of “technical exchanges.” Many of them sit on Chinese government\nboards that decide the future of China’s national technology investment. Another\nexample of a China S&T advocacy group is the Silicon Valley Chinese Engineers Association\n( 硅谷中国工程师协会 ), which describes itself as “a non-profit professional organization formed\nmainly by the professionals in the Bay Area from mainland China with a mission to\npromote professionalism and entrepreneurship among members,” which is achieved by\n“organizing a variety of professional activities and establishing channels to allow members to\nengage in China’s rapid economic development” [emphasis added]. 9\nChinese government tech transfer offices, facilitation companies, and career transfer\npersonnel, some of whom are posted to China’s diplomatic offices, support and direct\nthe US-based groups. In China, hundreds of government offices are devoted entirely to\nfacilitating foreign transfers of technology “by diverse means.”\nJoint research\nThe preferred method of establishing a research beachhead in the United States is through\nthe formation of a joint research center with a prominent US university. One example\nTechnology and Research\n125\nis the China-US Joint Research Center for Ecosystem and Environmental Change at the\nUniversity of Tennessee, Knoxville. 10 Launched in 2006, researchers from the University\nof Tennessee and the DOE-funded Oak Ridge National Laboratory partnered with the\nChinese Academy of Sciences to address “the combined effects of climate change and\nhuman activities on regional and global ecosystems and explore technologies for\nrestoration of degraded environments.” The center’s research focuses on science at the\nheart of the “green technology” revolution, which is one of Beijing’s major national\nindustrial policy objectives.\nThe center’s website lays out three goals that match nicely with a tech transfer agenda:\n(1) organize and implement international scientific and engineering research; (2) serve as\na center for scientific information exchange; and (3) provide international education and\ntechnical training. 11 The website goes on to outline cooperative mechanisms to achieve\nthese goals, including joint research projects, academic exchange, student education, and\n“technical transfer and training [emphasis added].” 12 This dynamic differs fundamentally\nfrom the mission of Western research facilities abroad, which is to adapt technology already\nin their portfolios to sell in foreign markets. A PRC study on the benefits of overseas\n“research” to obtain foreign technology put it this way: “How can you get the tiger cub if\nyou don’t go into the tiger’s den?” ( 不入虎穴 , 焉得虎子 ). 13\nCyber\nPerhaps the most damaging channel for stealing US intellectual property is cyberespionage.\nAs noted above, NSA director Keith Alexander has called cyberespionage by Chinese state\nactors the “greatest transfer of wealth in human history.” Cyberespionage is both a means\nfor pilfering US science and technology, as well as a method of intelligence collection\nfor potential attacks against American military, government, and commercial technical\nsystems. As a result, these cyber intrusions represent a fundamental threat to American\neconomic competitiveness and national security.\nOther means of misappropriation\nWhile not technology transfer per se, counterfeiting is so common in China that it has\nthe same practical effect. Schemes range from the subtle to blatant: benchmarking against\nISO standards; 14 patent research where a design is modified slightly, if at all, re-patented\nin China and “legally” produced with government protection; 15 reverse engineering; 16\n“imitative innovation” ( 模仿创新 ) 17 with or without the innovation (also called “imitative\nremanufacturing” 模仿改造 ); 18 and marketing the pirated product without or with its original\nlogo. 19 Other reporting has detailed how the Chinese government exploits regulatory panels\n(often with members who have direct conflicts of interest by working for local competitors)\nand antitrust investigations to acquire trade secrets from foreign companies, aiding\ndomestic industries. 20\nSection 8\n126\nConclusion and Recommendations\nChina’s aggressive policy is threatening the advantages the United States has long enjoyed as a\nscientifically creative nation. This is occurring as a declining number of US students\nare getting advanced degrees in science and technology, R&D funds are dropping off,\nand the nation’s manufacturing base is shrinking. 21 When combined with a more\nscientifically competent China that is also using the discoveries of others, the future of\nUS competitiveness comes into question.\nThe best source of resiliency in the face of rampant IP theft from China is continued\nand expanded reinvestment in American innovation. The United States can recover its\ncompetitiveness by manufacturing what it invents and rebuilding the scientific foundation\non which its competitive edge depends. But unless active efforts are made to prevent\ncountries from inappropriately exploiting American technologies developed at great cost,\nefforts at national reconstruction will be wasted. The United States’ current defense of\nintellectual property has not been effective in refuting appropriation by China, by all\naccounts the world’s worst offender.\nA key source of American creativity—the country’s individualism and openness—makes\nit difficult to implement collective efforts to protect the products of American innovation.\nNonetheless, policies and processes can be improved to reduce the risk of misappropriation\nwithout compromising America’s innovative capacity. These require improved transparency\nwith better information and screening, enhanced export controls, and stronger investment\nreviews.\nTransparency, better information, and screening\nOne of the most glaring factors that facilitates IP theft is the fact that recipients of Chinese\nfunding programs, such as the Thousand Talents Program described above, routinely do\nnot declare their work in China. At a minimum, recipients should be required to register as\nforeign agents under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). 22 Recipients who are active\ngovernment employees may be breaking the law, as 18 US Code § 209 prohibits accepting\nsupplemental income for performing the same role that falls under the scope of their\ngovernment employment. 23\nThe US government and universities should also take an evidence- and risk-based assessment\nwhen determining whether to admit students into major research programs. The current\nsystem, known as the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), 24 is\ndesigned “to track and monitor schools and programs, students, exchange visitors and their\ndependents while approved to participate in the US education system.” SEVIS collects data\non surnames and first names, addresses, date and country of birth, dependents’ information,\nnationality/citizenship, funding, school, program name, date of study commencement,\nTechnology and Research\n127\neducation degree level, and authorization for on-campus employment. As of March 2011,\nChina had the largest number of students in SEVIS, at 158,698. 25\nThe FBI has access to all of the student data contained in SEVIS, and no longer needs\nthe permission of DHS to initiate investigations of foreign students. 26 However, the laws,\nregulations, and directives governing SEVIS do not require some additional critical pieces\nof information, which are nonetheless perceived to be important to manage the program.\nAccording to the Government Accounting Office (GAO):\n• the nonimmigrant visa number, expiration date, and issuing post are optional and\nonly captured if entered into the system by the school or exchange visitor program;\n• the nonimmigrant driver’s license number and issuing state were imposed by the\ninteragency working group and support investigative efforts; and\n• the nonimmigrant passport number, passport expiration date, and passport issuing\ncountry are optional and only captured if entered into the system by the school or\nexchange visitor program. 27\nIt is difficult to ascertain from open sources whether these problems have been fixed, but\nthe nonmandatory data are key investigative details that would be critical for federal law\nenforcement seeking to assess possible illicit technology transfers by students.\nImproved export controls\nThe second major policy problem involves PRC student access to controlled technology\nunder the deemed export system. According to the Commerce Department, a restricted\nproduct or technology is “deemed,” or considered exported, when it is used by a foreign\nnational in the United States. 28 However, under these rules, a university or research lab\ndoes not need a deemed export license if a foreign graduate student is merely present in a\nlab. It only needs a license if it intends to export that technology to the foreign national’s\ncountry.\nFrom 2004 to 2006, the US Commerce Department attempted to change these rules, 29 but\nwas stymied by opposition from universities and research labs. 30 Yet the continued flow\nof controlled technology to the PRC and the findings of GAO studies on the problems\nof university oversight 31 strongly suggest that Commerce’s recommendations should be\nreexamined.\nIn 2009, then president Obama “directed a broad-based interagency reform of the US export\ncontrol system with the goal of strengthening national security and the competitiveness of\nkey US manufacturing and technology sectors by focusing on current threats and adapting\nSection 8\n128\nto the changing economic and technological landscape.” 32 Specifically, the initiative aimed\nto “build higher fences” around a core set of items whose misuse can pose a national security\nthreat to the United States. 33\nThe reform initiative is synchronizing the two existing control lists, the Munitions List and\nthe Commerce Control List, so that they are “tiered” to distinguish the types of items that\nshould be subject to stricter or more permissive levels of control for different destinations,\nend uses, and end users; create a “bright line” between the two current control lists to clarify\nwhich list an item is controlled on, and reduce government and industry uncertainty about\nwhether particular items are subject to the control of the State Department or the Commerce\nDepartment; and are structurally aligned so that they potentially can be combined into a\nsingle list of controlled items. 34\nMoreover, the lists will be transformed into a “positive list” that describes controlled items\nusing objective criteria (e.g., technical parameters such as horsepower or microns) rather\nthan broad, open-ended, subjective, generic, or design intent-based criteria. 35 After applying\nthese criteria, the list will be divided into three tiers based on their military importance and\navailability. 36\nOn the one hand, these reforms could greatly improve the efficiency of the export control\nbureaucracy, preventing fewer technologies from slipping between the cracks and finding\ntheir way to China. They could also make the system and its control lists better able to keep\npace with technological change, which had been a major problem with the old system,\nparticularly with regard to fast-moving information technologies. On the other hand, the\nreforms appear to loosen controls over dual-use technologies, which China has a long and\nsuccessful track record of integrating into advanced systems, and which can form the core\nof new innovations. The future of these reforms is unclear as the Trump administration\nappears to focus on more aggressive trade strategies and policies designed to protect US\nindustries and punish offending Chinese companies.\nStrong investment reviews\nThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is an interagency\ncommittee that serves the president in overseeing the national security implications of\nforeign investment in the economy. 37 As China’s economy and financial weight has grown,\nCFIUS has reviewed an increasing number of proposed acquisitions of American companies\nand infrastructure by Chinese entities. Many of these proposed mergers have received\nhigh levels of media and congressional attention, and most of the high-profile cases have\nended in rejection or strong discouragement leading to abandonment of the deal. While\nthe CFIUS process may have prevented individual cases of sensitive or illegal technology\ntransfer, it could also have had the unintended effect of forcing Chinese actors to steal the\ndata through espionage because of their inability to buy them. Recent legislation, signed by\nTechnology and Research\n129\nPresident Trump, is a substantial improvement to CFIUS, closing loopholes that the Chinese\nhad been exploiting and broadening the scope of the CFIUS authorities in important ways.\nThe new law extends CFIUS review time-frames, increases the types of transactions\nsubject to CFIUS’ jurisdiction, makes certain notifications mandatory, and establishes a\nprocess for potentially expedited review and approval of certain transactions. The four\nnew “covered transactions” include real estate deals near US national security facilities,\ndeals involving “critical infrastructure” or “critical technologies,” changes in ownership\nrights by a foreign investor, and any transaction designed to evade the CFIUS process. In\nexchange for all these additional burdens, the new law also helps companies by clarifying\ntime limits for decisions and places important jurisdictional limits on the expansion of the\nlaw’s scope.\nNOTES\n1 ​See Hannas, William, James Mulvenon, and Anna Puglisi, Chinese Industrial Espionage.

As the accompanying graphic illustrates, the bureaucracy involved in\nextending China’s global influence is large, complex, and specialized in function.\nGenerally speaking, there are three types of bureaucratic organizations included in\nthe chart: (1) policy coordination; (2) policy formulation and implementation; and\n(3) organizations with specialized functions.\nAs a Leninist party-state, CCP organizations have higher political status than\ngovernment institutions. This has become even more pronounced under the Party’s\ngeneral secretary Xi Jinping and following the bureaucratic reorganization announced\nafter the March 2018 meeting of the National People’s Congress. Generally speaking,\nParty organs make policies, which are then implemented by state bureaucracies. There\nis no single organization overseeing the entirety of the country’s influence operations\nabroad. The most important CCP organizations in the diagram are the Foreign Affairs\nCommission, the External Propaganda Leading Group/State Council Information\nOffice, the CCP Propaganda Department, the CCP United Front Work Department,\nthe CCP International Liaison Department, and United Front departments inside the\nPeople’s Liberation Army. Critical policies related to foreign affairs are formulated\nin these bodies. The same organizations are also involved in coordinating the\nimplementation of these policies.\nThe Policy-Making Process in the Chinese Party-State\nThe process is driven both by top leadership and functional bureaucracies. Policy\nformulation, which involves the generation of ideas and proposals, typically\ntakes place in functional bureaucracies and specialized departments within these\nbureaucracies. In the process of policy formulation, one bureaucracy specializing\nin the functional or issue area (for example, propaganda) may take charge, but it\n134\nalso consults with other bureaucracies that may have a stake in the issue. The draft\npolicy proposals are then forwarded to the Leading Small Groups ( 领导小组 ), which\ndeliberate, vet, and sign off on the policy proposals before sending them to the\nPolitburo and the Politburo Standing Committee for a final decision. These leading\nsmall groups, which range in size from five to a dozen members, are normally\nchaired by a Politburo member and include a range of ministerial-level officials\nrelevant to that functional policy area. Some meet at regular intervals (biweekly),\nwhereas most convene on an ad hoc basis when necessary. In this formal, ministryor\ndepartment-initiated process, the ultimate decision-making authority lies with the\nPolitburo Standing Committee.\nAt this level of policy formulation, of particular relevance to China’s international\ninfluence activities are the External Propaganda Leading Group ( 对外宣传领导小组 ),\nwhich has a dual bureaucratic identity as the State Council Information Office ( 国务新闻办公室 ); the Central Committee Propaganda Department ( 中共中央宣传部 ); the Central\nCommittee United Front Work Department ( 中共中央统战部 ); the Central Committee\nForeign Affairs Commission ( 中共外事委员会 ); 1 and the Central Committee Education\nLeading Small Group ( 教育部 ). Although bureaucratically ranked slightly lower, the\nMinistry of Culture and Tourism, the Ministry of Education, the newly created Voice\nof China, and the Xinhua News Agency all exercise policy formulation and oversight\nroles in their functional domains.\nThere is also a parallel top-down policy process initiated by one of the top leaders\non the Politburo Standing Committee. As a rule, Xi Jinping, the CCP general\nsecretary, has broad authority and may issue a brief directive on a matter he\nbelieves should receive extra attention or priority. (Typically, such directives are\nshort comments he writes on reports that come across his desk.) Otherwise, only\na Politburo Standing Committee (PBSC) member overseeing a particular portfolio\ncan issue such directives on matters that fall into his area of responsibility. Such\ncomments are then related to the functional bureaucracies and can lead to the\nformulation of a new policy, the modification of an existing policy, or other\nactions.\nOn the Politburo and its seven-member PBSC, several members have direct\nresponsibility for external affairs. As the chair of the Foreign Affairs Commission, Xi\nhas overall authority on all aspects of China’s foreign relations. Wang Huning, the\nStanding Committee member responsible for Party affairs, ideology, and propaganda,\nAppendix 1\n135\nis the top official with oversight of China’s overseas propaganda ( 外宣 ) efforts, while\nPolitburo member and director of the CCP Propaganda Department Huang Kunming\noversees all media organs and has day-to-day oversight of the entire propaganda\nsystem. Wang Yang, another PBSC member and the chairman of the Chinese\nPeople’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), has overall responsibility for\nthe United Front portfolio, although Sun Chunlan (the only female member of the\ntwenty-five-man Politburo and former director of the United Front Work Department\nfrom 2014 to 2017) may also continue to have some residual responsibilities as well,\nsince her current portfolio includes education and culture. Additionally, You Quan, a\nmember of the Politburo Secretariat, is now the new head of the UFWD, and he is in\ncharge of the day-to-day work of the department. These leaders’ views on particular\nissues carry a great deal of weight and can often result in significant policy\ninitiatives or modifications.\nBesides issuing brief policy directives via their comments on documents (known\nas 批示 ), top leaders can also communicate their ideas or orders in conversations or\nmeetings with the ministers in charge of functional bureaucracies. Such ideas or orders\ncan lead to actions at the implementation level or to the formulation of a new policy or\nthe modifications of an existing policy.\nPolicy Coordination\nThe Foreign Affairs Commission, which used to be called the Foreign Affairs\nLeading Small Group (est. 1956), is by far the most important. The role of the\nCommission is similar to that of the interagency “principals committees” in the\nUS system. Its chairman is Xi Jinping, while Premier Li Keqiang and Vice President\nWang Qishan serve as vice chairmen. Other PBSC members Wang Huning and\nHan Zheng are members. Le Yucheng, a vice minister of Foreign Affairs, is deputy\ndirector. Other members of the Commission include the most senior leaders\nof the Chinese government: Yang Jiechi, and the ministers of Foreign Affairs,\nState Security, Defense, Public Security, Commerce, the CCP’s International\nLiaison Department, Taiwan Affairs Office, Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office,\nPropaganda Department, External Propaganda Office, and Overseas Chinese Affairs\nOffice.\nThe Commission also has an attached “office,” known as the Central Foreign Affairs\nOffice ( 中央外办 ), which has a dedicated staff of approximately fifty (many of whom are\nseconded from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Liaison Department of the\nAppendix 1\n136\nCCP, other ministries, and the military). The director of this office is currently Yang\nJiechi—a Politburo member, former state councilor, and veteran diplomat. This body is\nthe central coordinating body for China’s foreign affairs—across all bureaucracies—on\na daily basis.\nWhile the Foreign Affairs Commission is the principal organization in the making\nand coordination of China’s overall foreign policy, the United Front Leading Small\nGroup and the External Propaganda Leading Small Group also have important—but\nsomewhat lower—status in the Chinese hierarchy. They are led, respectively, by the\nPolitburo Standing Committee member in charge of ideology and propaganda and\nthe head of the United Front Work Department. The Leading Small Group for United\nFront Work is located inside the CCP’s United Front Work Department and draws on\nUFWD personnel for staff work. The Leading Small Group for External Propaganda\nis subordinate to the CCP Leading Small Group for Propaganda and Ideology and\nis required to seek guidance from the Foreign Affairs Commission, and it draws on\nthe State Council Information Office (with which it has a dual role) for staff work.\nBoth groups play an important role in the formulation of policy and coordination of\nimplementation in their respective sectors.\nConferences\nAnother important instrument in the coordination of policy is the Central or National\nConferences that are convened to formulate and announce new policy objectives\nand mobilize the bureaucracy to implement these policies. Some of these conferences\nare convened more frequently and are more important than others. Four central or\nnational conferences are held to coordinate foreign policy and external influence\noperations: the Central Foreign Affairs Work Conference, the External Propaganda Work\nConference, the Central United Front Work Conference, and the National Overseas\nChinese Work Conference. These are large gatherings that last two to three days and\nare attended by key central, provincial, and local leaders, as well as various ministries\nand the Chinese military. These conferences serve to provide overall policy direction to\ncadres working in that bureaucratic system ( 系统 ) as well as to issue very specific annual\nplans for the coming year’s activities. 2\nOne measure of the importance of these conferences can be gauged by who gives the\nkeynote speech. For example, Xi Jinping gave the keynote speeches at the Central\nForeign Affairs Work Conference (2014 and 2018), the Central United Front Work\nAppendix 1\n137\nConference (2015), and the National Propaganda Work Conference (2013 and 2018).\nWhen Xi does not give the keynote speech, the Politburo member in charge of that\ndomain gives it. By contrast, the keynote speech at the National Overseas Chinese\nConference in 2017 was given by Yang Jiechi, who was at that time a state councilor\nresponsible for foreign affairs.\n• The Central Foreign Affairs Work Conference is held at irregular intervals (2006,\n2014, and 2018) to review Chinese foreign policy and announce new initiatives\nand objectives. It is attended by key ministers, ambassadors, senior military\nofficers, and local officials responsible for foreign affairs.\n• The Central United Front Work Conference, which used to be called the National\nUnited Front Work Conference, is also convened at irregular intervals (2000, 2006,\nand 2015). Both national and local officials responsible for religious, ethnic, and\noverseas Chinese affairs participate.\n• Prior to 2013, the External Propaganda Work Conference was convened annually.\nBut starting after that year, this conference has become part of the annual National\nPropaganda Work Conference. Officials in the propaganda sector from all over\nChina attend these conferences.\n• The National Overseas Chinese Work Conference was held roughly every six years\n(2005, 2011, and 2017). Only national and local officials responsible for overseas\nChinese affairs participate.\nHierarchy and Division of Labor\nThe CCP-affiliated organizations in our diagram that are involved in making policies\nconcerned with Chinese influence activities abroad enjoy higher political status\nthan those that execute these policies. What makes the Chinese system notable is\nthe division of labor, the specialization of its bureaucracies, and the staffing of these\nbureaucracies with well-trained and experienced professionals. Besides engaging\ntheir counterparts overseas, these bureaucracies either oversee or directly conduct\ninfluence operations in their areas of specialization. While there exists no single\norganization overseeing the entirety of China’s influence activities abroad (although\nif any one does have such sweeping purview, it is the Foreign Affairs Commission),\nin the implementation of policies aimed to expand Chinese influence abroad, there\nAppendix 1\n138\nare two types of bureaucracies: (1) general-purpose bureaucracies, and (2) specialized\nbureaucracies. The following institutional profiles include many of the principal bodies\ninvolved in China’s overseas influence activities.\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs is a typical general-purpose bureaucracy that serves\nas China’s main interlocutor with foreign governments. But since most of its time is\nconsumed by routine diplomatic activities, the Foreign Ministry itself does not play a\nsignificant role in influence operations overseas. The one area where it does is via its\nDepartment of Public Diplomacy ( 外交部公共外交司 ), which primarily oversees the MFA\nSpokesman’s Office in Beijing, international media outreach, and China’s embassy\nspokesmen abroad; international visitor programs; and “exchange” organizations, such\nas the Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs (which bring a range of former\nofficials and international affairs experts to China). Also, the MFA is important\ninsofar as Chinese embassies abroad have representatives of the Ministry of Culture,\nthe Xinhua News Agency, the CCP International Liaison Department, the Ministry\nof Education, and other bureaucratic bodies, each of which are involved in foreign\ninfluence activities.\nUnited Front Work Department\nThe CCP United Front Work Department is a specialized CCP organization, one of\nfour Central Committee departments. 3 Its principal mission is to build support for\nthe CCP and its policies among domestic ethnic groups, religious groups, the eight\nso-called democratic parties ( 民主党派 ), the Chinese diaspora worldwide, and political,\neconomic, and social elites in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. These United Front\nactivities have a long history dating to the CCP’s pre-1949 rise to power. The main\ntasks and objectives of the CCP’s United Front activities outside of Greater China are\nlaid out in Article 31 of the CCP Guidelines on United Front Work ( 中国共产党统一战线工作条例 ) issued in 2015—they target almost exclusively the Chinese diaspora, who\nare supposed to be encouraged to “contribute to the modernization and reunification\nof the motherland, advance the cause of opposing (Taiwanese) independence and\npromoting reunification, inherit and propagate China’s outstanding culture, and\npromote the friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of the other\ncountries in the world.”\nAppendix 1\n139\nAlthough the United Front Work Department has attracted much media attention,\nand the term “United Front” has become a euphemistic one for many analysts writing\nabout China’s influence activities abroad, the scope of the UFWD’s activities in\nChina’s external influence operations is actually limited. Its primary target audience\nis the Chinese diaspora in general, and its elite members in particular. The mission\nof engaging and influencing nonethnic Chinese audiences, individuals, and foreign\ninstitutions is assigned to other specialized Chinese entities—such as the Chinese\nAcademy of Social Sciences, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Education,\nthe Ministry of State Security (e.g., China Institutes of Contemporary International\nRelations), and other institutions that have well-trained professionals and long-standing\nties with their counterparts overseas.\nInternational [Liaison] Department\nThe CCP’s International [Liaison] Department ( 中央联络部 ) is in charge of “party-toparty\nrelations” ( 党际关系 ) and has the primary mission of cultivating foreign political\nparties and politicians around the world. This Party organ has existed since before\n1949 and was formerly charged with maintaining China’s fraternal ties with other\ncommunist and socialist parties around the world, but in the wake of the Cold War,\nthe CCP/ID drastically broadened its mandate to interact with virtually all political\nparties abroad (except fascist and racist parties). Today it claims to maintain ties\nwith over 400 political parties in 140 countries, receives about 200 delegations,\nand dispatches about 100 abroad every year. CCP/ID exchanges have provided an\nimportant prism through which the CCP and other organizations in China monitor\nthe outside world and absorb lessons for China’s own modernization. This kind of\ninformation gathering goes well beyond traditional intelligence collection (although,\nto be sure, the ID also engages in this activity).\nThrough its interactions with political parties all over the world, the CCP/ID serves\nan important function as a kind of “radar” for identifying up-and-coming foreign\npoliticians before they attain national prominence and office. Having identified\nsuch rising stars, the CCP/ID brings them to China (usually on all-expenses-paid\nvisits)—often offering them their first exposure to China and trying to make the\nbest possible impression on them. Another key dimension of this function has been to\nexpose CCP leaders at the provincial and sub-provincial levels to the outside world—\noften for the first time. Many provincial Party secretaries, governors, mayors and other\nleading local cadres are taken abroad on ID delegations every year. The CCP/ID has\nAppendix 1\n140\nalso played a key diplomatic role in certain instances, such as providing a liaison\ndialogue channel between the United States and North Korea.\nIn addition, the ILD performs a range of other functions:\n• Administering “private sector” liaison organizations to facilitate contact with\nthink tanks, NGOs, and individuals worldwide;\n• Collecting current intelligence and information on the foreign policies,\ndomestic political scene and political parties, and societies in various nations\nworldwide;\n• Sending special study teams abroad to research important topics related to\nChina’s reforms;\n• Contributing to the work of Chinese embassies worldwide (usually monitoring\ndomestic politics and liaising with domestic political parties, movements, and\npersonages);\n• Working with other CCP Central Committee departments and State Council\nministries to facilitate their work overseas (e.g., assisting the United Front Work\nDepartment concerning Taiwan, the External Propaganda Leading Group/State\nCouncil Information Office concerning China’s image abroad, or the National\nPeople’s Congress on parliamentary exchanges);\n• Arranging visits of central-level, provincial-level, municipal-level, and\noccasionally sub-provincial level CCP officials abroad;\n• Hosting foreign leaders, politicians, party officials, ex-officials, as well as a range\nof foreign policy specialists, on tours of China;\n• Hosting biannual World Political Parties High-Level Meeting, and the annual\n“CCP in Dialogue with the World” meeting.\nAs such, the ILD performs extremely important roles overseas and is a key—but\nunderappreciated and even unknown—instrument in China’s international influence\nactivities.\nAppendix 1\n141\nThe State Council Information Office/External Propaganda Leading Group\nThe State Council Information Office/External Propaganda Leading Group is the nerve\ncenter and leading organ in the sprawling system of China’s international propaganda\n( 对外外宣 ) work. It maps out the entirety of China’s overseas “publicity” work, assigns\ndifferent bureaucratic entities with specific tasks, fixes budgets for entities in this\nsystem, and convenes yearly meetings to implement the annual external propaganda\nplan ( 对外宣传计划 ). The SCIO is commonly known in Chinese both as the Guo Xin\nBan ( 国新办 ) and Wai Xuan Ban (External Propaganda Office, 外宣办 ). The reason for\nthe two names is because it straddles two bureaucratic systems—the party and the\nstate. It is formally under the State Council, but it is also overseen by the Chinese\nCommunist Party’s External Propaganda Leading Group (or EPLG). This bureaucratic\nduality is what the Chinese describe as “one organ, two signboards” ( 一个机构两块牌子 ),\na reference to the white placards that hang outside the gates of all Chinese institutions\n(in this case giving the appearance of two different institutions, but in reality with\nonly one inside). As such, the SCIO is the administrative office for the EPLG, playing\na coordinating role in the media area similar to that performed by the Central Foreign\nAffairs Office (CFAO, 中央外办 ) for the Foreign Affairs Commission ( 中央外事委员会 ).\nNOTES\n1 ​This body was upgraded from Leading Small Group status in March 2018.\n2 ​These plans are normally classified and only circulated within the Chinese bureaucracies, but\noccasionally they find their way into the public domain.

But this issue is hardly\nunique to the United States—indeed, China’s influence activities now occur all around\nthe world. In some instances, notably Australia, these activities appear to have proceeded\nmuch further than they have so far in the United States. In general, they seem more\nadvanced in Asia and Europe, but there is also evidence of such activities in Africa and\nLatin America as well.\nIn order to explore some of the wider patterns that have emerged, this appendix offers\nbrief summaries of the effects of such activities in eight countries: Australia, Canada,\nFrance, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. In each\nof these settings, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has refined its efforts through\ntrial and error in order to exploit a critical asymmetry: China’s Communist party-state\nhas established barriers to external political influence at home while, at the same time,\nseizing upon the openness of democratic systems overseas.\nChina seeks to make itself more palatable to democratic societies by using many of\nthe customary vehicles of soft power—such as state-funded research centers, media\noutlets, university ties, and people-to-people exchange programs. These programs\nmimic the work of independent civil society institutions in a democracy, cloaking\nthe extent to which the party-state controls these activities and genuine civil society\nis tightly repressed inside China. In conjunction with the dramatic expansion of\nChinese economic interests abroad, the Chinese government has focused its influence\ninitiatives on obscuring its policies and suppressing, to the extent possible, voices\nbeyond China’s borders that are critical of the CCP. 1 Targeting the media, academia,\nand the policy community, Beijing seeks to penetrate institutions in democratic states\nthat might draw attention or raise obstacles to CCP interests, creating disincentives for\nany such resistance. Chinese economic activity is another important tool in this effort.\nBeijing is particularly skilled at using economic leverage to advance political goals in\nthe realm of ideas, working through indirect channels that are not always apparent\nunless one examines Chinese business activities in conjunction with Beijing’s other\ninfluence efforts.\n146\nDemocracies worldwide are reckoning with the impact of “sharp power.” 2 From Central\nEurope, where China has created the “16 + 1 Initiative,” to sub-Saharan Africa and\nLatin America, where Chinese engagement in infrastructure and the media has grown\ndiscernibly in recent years, China’s sharp power has come into view. A good deal more\nstudy is needed to understand the impact of these influence activities globally. Only\nwith such understanding and comparative case studies can democratic societies craft\nresponses that safeguard the integrity of their institutions while staying true to liberal\ndemocratic values.\nNOTES\n1 ​Sarah Cook, “The Long Shadow of Chinese Censorship: How the Communist Party’s Media Restrictions\nAffect News Outlets Around the World,” Center for International Media Assistance, October 22, 2013,\naccessed October 11, 2018, http://www​.cima​.ned​.org​/wp​-content​/uploads​/2015​/02​/CIMA​-China​_Sarah%20\nCook​.pdf.\n2 ​Juan Pablo Cardenal, Jacek Kucharczyk, Grigorij Mesežnikov, and Gabriela Pleschová, Sharp Power:\nRising Authoritarian Influence (Washington, DC: National Endowment for Democracy, December 2017),\naccessed October 11, 2018, https://www​.ned​.org​/wp​-content​/uploads​/2017​/12​/Sharp​-Power​-Rising​\n- Authoritarian​- Influence​- Full​- Report​. pdf.\nAUSTRALIA\nAustralian journalists, scholars, officials, and political leaders have found themselves\non the frontlines of a global debate on how the Chinese Communist Party is working\nto covertly manipulate the political processes of democracies around the world. The\nAustralian government has been the first to formulate a coherent and principled policy\nresponse. These efforts have had a catalyzing international impact. Randall Schriver,\nthe Pentagon’s senior official for Asia, said Australia has “woken up people in a lot of\ncountries to take a look at Chinese activity within their own borders.” 1 Hillary Clinton,\nthe former New York senator and presidential candidate, said Australia (together\nwith New Zealand) has sounded the alarm on “a new global battle.” 2 Government\nleaders in New Zealand, Canada, and the United Kingdom have all been paying close\nattention to these growing Chinese activities. And yet, despite leading the way, effective\nimplementation is far from assured in Australia. Sustaining a counter-interference\nstrategy against the CCP—with its unrivalled resources and organization—will require\nan unprecedented degree of policy fortitude and political strategy from Australian\npolitical leaders on both sides of the parliamentary aisle as well as the support of\nbusiness leaders and the general public.\nThe Australia conversation has mostly been led by enterprising journalists and aided\nby a handful of sinologists. It has been a healthy catalytic process in which security\nagencies have been communicating warnings to institutions at risk and politicians\nAppendix 2\n147\nhave been taking security agencies and credible media investigations seriously. The\ndirector-general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, Duncan Lewis,\nsaid the espionage and interference threat is greater now than at any time during\nthe Cold War due to a greater number of foreign intelligence actors and the advent\nof cybertechnologies. He said foreign interference activities range from “a foreign\npower using local Australians to observe and harass its diaspora community here in\nour country through to the recruitment and co-opting of influential and powerful\nAustralian voices to lobby our decision-makers.” 3\nMuch of the debate—particularly in its early stages—has been anchored in the\ncommunity of Chinese Australians. Ethnic Chinese writers, entrepreneurs, and\nactivists led the way in drawing the nation’s attention to the party’s efforts\nto suppress the diversity of their opinions through surveillance, coercion, and co-option.\nIn 2005, Chinese defector Chen Yonglin exposed an enormous informant network\nthat kept tabs on Chinese Australians, including Falun Gong practitioners, who\ndefied the party line. In 2008, thousands of red flag-waving students were mobilized\nto march on Canberra’s Parliament to “defend the sacred Olympic torch” against\npro-Tibet and other protestors as the torch wound its way to the Olympic ceremony\nin Beijing. 4 More recently, Chinese Australian journalists have laid a foundation\nof investigative reporting on the Chinese Communist Party’s concealed links\nto Australian politics. Philip Wen, Beijing correspondent for the Sydney Morning\nHerald, showed how the party was “astroturfing” grassroots political movements\nto give the impression of ethnic Chinese support for Beijing’s policies and leaders\nand to drown out its opponents. Over the past two years, Australian investigative\njournalists have documented a series of examples of Beijing-linked political donors\nbuying access and influence, universities being co-opted as “propaganda vehicles,”\nand Australian-funded scientific research being diverted to aid the modernization of\nthe People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Some of those reports showed how the CCP was\nusing tools of coercion and co-option to manipulate deliberations of the Australian\nParliament.\nIn 2017, CCP interference in Australian democratic processes became so brazen that\nparty officials began to use their capability for interference as diplomatic leverage. The\ntargets were bipartisan. The CCP reportedly leveraged the fact of its arbitrary power\nover Australian prisoners in China as it sought to persuade the Malcolm Turnbull\ngovernment to ratify a controversial extradition treaty. 5 And Meng Jianzhu, then\nChina’s minister of public security, warned the Labor opposition leadership about the\nelectoral consequences of failing to endorse the treaty. According to the Australian\nnewspaper: “Mr. Meng said it would be a shame if Chinese government representatives\nhad to tell the Chinese community in Australia that Labor did not support the relationship\nbetween Australia and China.” 6\nAppendix 2\n148\nIn June 2017, a joint investigation by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and\nFairfax Media revealed that the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO)\nhad warned the major political parties that two of Australia’s most generous political\ndonors had “strong connections to the Chinese Communist Party” and that their\n“donations might come with strings attached.” 7 One of them leveraged a $400,000\ndonation in an attempt to soften the Labor Party line on the South China Sea. Most\nnotoriously, an ambitious young Labor senator, Sam Dastyari, was shown to have\nrecited Beijing’s South China Sea talking points almost word-for-word immediately\nafter the political donor had threatened to withdraw his money. Dastyari was also\nshown to have given countersurveillance advice to the donor. As a result of these\nactions, Dastyari was forced to resign from Parliament. Again, the CCP was shown to\nbe working both sides of the political aisle. The Liberal trade minister, Andrew Robb,\nwas shown to have stepped directly from office into a consultancy job to the CCPlinked\ncompany that bought a controversial lease for the Port of Darwin. The contract\nshowed Robb to be earning 880,000 Australian dollars per year (more than 600,000 US\ndollars plus goods and services tax) for unspecified services. 8\nResponse and Counterresponse\nIn December 2017, as the political attacks on Dastyari came to a head, Prime Minister\nTurnbull revealed that his coalition government had been “galvanized” by a classified\nreport into foreign interference which he had commissioned in August 2016. Turnbull\nunveiled a new counter-foreign-interference strategy which he said would be shaped\nby four principles. First, the strategy would target the activities of foreign states\nand not the loyalties of foreign-born Australians. As Turnbull put it, “Our diaspora\ncommunities are part of the solution, not the problem.” Second, the strategy would be\ncountry-agnostic and not single out Chinese interference. Third, it would distinguish\nconduct that is “covert, coercive, or corrupting” from legitimate and transparent public\ndiplomacy. And fourth, it would be built upon the pillars of “sunlight, enforcement,\ndeterrence, and capability.” 9\nAt the same time, the prime minister introduced sweeping new legislation into\nParliament. One bill introduced a wide-reaching ban on foreign political donations,\nincluding measures to prevent foreigners from channeling donations through\nlocal entities. 10 A second bill imposed disclosure obligations for those working in\nAustralian politics on behalf of a foreign principal. This bill would capture many of\nthe indirect methodologies of CCP intelligence and United Front Work Department\n(UFWD) operations that are not caught by the US Foreign Agents Registration\nAct. And a third tranche of legislation would close some large loopholes in the\nAustralian criminal law by introducing tough but graduated political interference\nand espionage offenses.\nAppendix 2\n149\nTurnbull also introduced legislation to establish a new Department of Home Affairs\nwhich, among other roles, would house a national counter-foreign-interference\ncoordinator who would integrate intelligence and enforcement and coordinate policy\ndevelopment. On December 16, 2017, at the height of this debate—and days after\nTurnbull introduced the new laws—the coalition government passed a serious electoral\ntest by winning a by-election in the Sydney seat of Bennelong. According to one\nopinion poll, two-thirds of voters support the foreign interference legislation, with just\n11 percent opposed—in a seat that has one of the largest ethnic Chinese communities\nin the country.\nAnd yet, despite this policy progress, strong evidence of electoral support, and\nfavorable international recognition, the Turnbull government found the politics and\nthe diplomacy to be heavy going. At one level this is not surprising. The CCP excels in\nusing covert and deceptive means to work preexisting fault lines of open, democratic\nsocieties. It has shown itself prepared to use the levers of economic engagement as a\ntool of political coercion. And there is no precedent for a mid-sized, open, multicultural\nnation standing its ground against a rising authoritarian superpower that accounts for a\nlarge proportion of its migrants and one in every three of its export dollars.\nAfter seizing the political and policy initiative in 2017, the Turnbull government went\nquiet over the first half of 2018. It faced pushback from powerful domestic lobbying\ngroups arguing that the proposed legislation went too far. Media firms targeted the\nespionage law, charities the donations law, and universities the proposed transparency\nlaw. Further resistance was mounted by multicultural lobbyists who maintained that\nAustralia’s reputation as an inclusive society was challenged by mention of foreign\ngovernment interference in community affairs. Prominent business leaders and\nacademics with China contracts called for an end to “China-bashing.”\nChina’s embassy in Canberra also played a part, publicly intervening as if it were\na champion of Chinese Australian communities to confront “racist bigotry” in\nAustralia. China’s government consistently portrayed the counter-interference policies\nand conversation as an attack on “China” and “Chinese people.” And Beijing framed\nCanberra’s efforts to defend its institutions as an attack on the bilateral relationship. As if\nto confirm its own judgment, Beijing was reported to have frozen ministerial and official\nmeetings across a range of key portfolios. In the ensuing silence, some of the CCP’s most\npotent narratives filled the vacuum. It was not clear that the Turnbull government could\npush through the most significant overhaul of counterintelligence legislation in forty\nyears without explaining why it was necessary.\nIt took a series of further explosive media investigations and some unorthodox political\ninterventions to regain control of the conversation and ensure bipartisan support for the\nAppendix 2\n150\nlegislation. The chair of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence & Security,\nAndrew Hastie, named one of Australia’s most generous political donors as a “coconspirator”\nin a UN bribery investigation and linked the affair to covert interference.\n“In Australia it is clear that the Chinese Communist Party is working to covertly\ninterfere with our media and universities and also to influence our political processes\nand public debates,” Hastie told his committee, after receiving support from the deputy\nchair, Anthony Byrne. “And it’s time we applied sunlight to our political system and a\nperson who has featured prominently in Australian politics over the past decade.” 11\nThe counter-interference criminal legislation and the foreign influence transparency\nscheme both passed through Parliament on June 28. The Home Affairs legislation had\npassed through Parliament earlier in the year, with the counter-foreign-interference\ntask force established in April 2018. This effectively elevated the importance of\ncountering foreign interference to a similar status as countering terrorism. 12 At the time\nof writing, the legislation to ban foreign political donations has not passed through\nParliament. And Turnbull himself has been replaced as prime minister. The new prime\nminister, Scott Morrison, appears to have opted for policy continuity.\nThe Turnbull government led the way in diagnosing the challenge, forging an internal\nconsensus, and setting out a bold and coherent counterstrategy. Australia became the\nfirst country in the world to lay the foundations for a sustained and coherent counterinterference\nstrategy.\nBut if Australia is going to reset the terms of its engagement with a superpower—holding\nChina to its principle of noninterference and setting a precedent of sovereign equality\nthat others might follow—then it will have to accept strains on the bilateral relationship.\nIf the government is to successfully implement a transformational strategy to defend\nAustralia’s democratic processes and social cohesion, then it has to find politically\nsustainable ways of engaging the democratic process and publicly making the case.\nNOTES\n1 ​Peter Hartcher, “Australia Has ‘Woken Up’ the World on China’s Influence: US Official,” Sydney Morning\nHerald, February 27, 2018, accessed October 11, 2018, https://www​.smh​.com​.au​/politics​/federal​/australia​\n- has​- woken​- up​- the​- world​- on​- china​- s​- influence​- us​- official​- 20180226​- p4z1un​. html.\n2 ​Ben Doherty and Eleanor Ainge Roy, “Hillary Clinton Says China’s Foreign Power Grab ‘A New Global\nBattle,’ ” Guardian (UK), May 8, 2018, accessed October 11, 2018, https://www​. theguardian​. com​/ us​-news​\n/ 2018​/ may​/ 08​/ hillary​- clinton​- says​- chinas​- foreign​- power​- grab​- a​- new​- global​- battle.\n3 ​“Advisory Report on the National Security Legislation Amendment,” Parliament of Australia, June 7, 2018,\naccessed October 11, 2018, https://www​.aph​.gov​.au​/Parliamentary​_Business​/Committees​/Joint​/Intelligence​\n_and​_Security​/EspionageFInterference​/Report​/section​?id​= ​committees%2Freportjnt%2F024152%2F25708.\n4 ​Rob Taylor, “Chinese Rally in Australia to Guard Olympic Flame,” Reuters, April 15, 2008, accessed\nOctober 11, 2018, https://www​.reuters​.com​/article​/idUSSYD3301.\nAppendix 2\n151\n5 ​Greg Sheridan, “Malcolm Turnbull’s Chinese Double: Dishonour and Defeat,” Australian (New South Wales),\nMarch 30, 2017 (requires subscription), https://www​.theaustralian​.com​.au​/opinion​/columnists​/greg​-sheridan​\n/turnbulls​-chinese​-double-dishonour-and-defeat/news-story/55fbe920041a5f5ff7ec04b818085631.\n6 ​Primrose Riordan, “China’s Veiled Threat to Bill Shorten on Extradition Treaty,” Australian (New South Wales),\nDecember 4, 2017 (requires subscription), https://www​.theaustralian​.com​.au​/national​-affairs​/foreign​-affairs​\n/chinas​-veiled​-threat​-to​-bill​-shorten​-on​-extradition​-treaty​/news​-story​/ad793a4366ad2f94694e89c92d52a978.\n7 ​“Power and Influence: The Hard Edge of China’s Soft Power,” Australian Broadcasting Corporation,\nJune 5, 2017, expires December 7, 2018, accessed October 11, 2018, http://www​.abc​.net​.au​/4corners​/power​\n- and​- influence​- promo​/ 8579844.\n8 ​Nick McKenzie and James Massola, “Andrew Robb’s Secret China Contract: Money for Nothing,” Sydney\nMorning Herald, December 6, 2017, accessed October 11, 2018, https://www​.smh​.com​.au​/politics​/federal​\n/ andrew​- robbs​- secret​- china​- contract​- money​- for​- nothing​- 20171205​- gzzaq5​. html.\n9 ​Malcolm Turnbull, “Speech Introducing the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and\nForeign Interference) Bill 2017,” December 7, 2017, accessed October 11, 2018, https:// www​. malcolmturnbull​\n.com​.au​/media​/speech​-introducing​-the​-national​-security​-legislation​-amendment​-espionage​-an.\n10 The debate in Australia has evolved considerably since 2009, when Prime Minister Kevin Rudd proposed\ncampaign finance reform legislation that would have rendered foreign-sourced political donations illegal,\nand Turnbull (as opposition leader in parliament) declined to support the legislation. Rudd has argued that\nthis legislation would have mitigated some of the more problematic behaviors regarding foreign influence\nthat have since occurred. Others, however, maintain that the ban would not have stopped the bulk of\nCCP-backed donations, which are channeled through Australian residents and citizens, and that the more\nimportant reform was to ensure greater transparency in identifying foreign agents.

There are roughly\n160,000 PRC students in Canadian schools, about 70 percent of them in universities\nand colleges. Per capita, this is about three times as large as in the United States and\nroughly on par with Australia.\nCanadian experiences with Chinese interference are less intense than those documented\nin Australia and New Zealand. As early as 1997, a leaked report by Canada’s RCMP-SIS\nAppendix 2\n152\n(the Security Intelligence Service of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) identified\nimproper influence through community associations connected to Chinese intelligence\nagencies and efforts to award politically connected Canadians in high-level roles with\nChinese entities. 1 Today, the view in Ottawa is that China is definitely trying to influence\nCanadian opinion and opinion-makers but is not making much headway at present. At\nthe federal level, the greatest concern with China has to do with the acquisition, often by\nlegal means, of strategic Canadian assets such as oil sands or major companies.\nAs in other countries, Chinese state actors (the CCP International Liaison Department,\ncommercial entities, media) have targeted political parties and politicians (with a few\nongoing cases at the provincial and municipal levels that are being investigated by the\nRCMP), civil society (through Confucius Institutes and consular outreach), and academia\n(through the Chinese Students’ Association, China Scholarship Council supervision of\nstudent recipients, and pressure on Canadian China specialists). An informal survey\nof Canadian China professionals (political and business actors) and China specialists\n(research professionals) confirms some PRC state activity in all these realms. But no cases\nhave yet reached the intensity or threat documented in Australia and New Zealand.\nIn large part, this difference in intensity is due to material factors: Canada is less\ndependent economically on China than Australia and New Zealand but smaller and\nless powerful than the United States. In short, while facing similar influence and\ninterference efforts from China, Canada—like the United States—appears to have more\neffective mechanisms (diplomacy, election funding transparency, foreign investment\nregulations) than Australia and New Zealand. Indeed, in May 2018 Canada’s security\nservice produced a report warning of the extent of interference in New Zealand. 2\nPolitics\nThe Liberal government elected in October 2015 is inclined to expand relations\nwith China at the diplomatic and commercial levels, including with some form of\nbilateral free trade agreement and deeper cooperation on global issues like climate\nchange, counterterrorism, and peacekeeping. Yet, despite Asia’s rising geoeconomic\nand geopolitical weight, Canada’s strategic center of gravity remains heavily tied to\nthe United States and the transatlantic world and to Western perspectives. There are\nsignificant disagreements in the public and within government about the possibilities,\nopportunities, limits, and risks of a deeper relationship with China.\nMedia reports highlighting concerns over improper interference include the following:\n• In 2010, the director of CSIS, Canada’s national security agency, said at least\ntwo provincial cabinet members and other government officials were under the\nAppendix 2\n153\ncontrol of foreign countries (including China). 3 Facing political pressure, he later\nsaid none of the actions were “illegal” and that “foreign interference is a common\noccurrence in many countries around the world and has been for decades.” 4\n• In 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was a subject of controversy for his\nattendance at cash-for-access dinners. 5 Among the attendees were Chinese billionaire\nZhang Bin, who donated $1 million to the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation. Also\nat the dinner was Liu Meng, a CCP official who was opening a Chinese Chamber of\nCommerce, a common United Front organization, in the country.\n• In 2017, a Conservative member of Parliament was denied a visa to visit China\nbecause she intended to raise questions about human rights. 6\n• In October 2017, the Financial Times acquired a United Front teaching manual\nwhich praised the success of overseas Chinese candidates in Toronto elections,\nwriting, “We should aim to work with those individuals and groups that are\nat a relatively high level, operate within the mainstream of society and have\nprospects for advancement.” 7\n• In December 2017, the Globe and Mail reported that two Conservative senators\nhad set up a private consulting business with the intent of attracting Chinese\ninvestment to Newfoundland and Labrador. 8 The paper also reported that the\nSenate’s ethics watchdog was investigating an all-expenses-paid trip to China\nby three Conservative senators, including one involved in the consulting\ncompany. 9 (The paper had previously reported on thirty-six trips to China\nfunded by arms of the Chinese government or business groups. 10 )\n• In December 2017, Conservative senator Linda Frum called for an investigation\ninto improper influence in Canada. 11 She alleged that laws banning direct foreign\ndonations to political parties are sufficiently robust, but third-party groups—so\nlong as they receive funds six months prior to the election—can use foreign\nmoney to influence voters.\nCivil Society\nIn 2016, the New York Times reported about pressure on independent Chinese-language\nmedia in Canada. 12 In January 2018, a coalition led by Amnesty International submitted\na confidential report to the Canadian government detailing harassment and digital\ndisinformation campaigns and direct threats against Uyghurs, Tibetans, Taiwanese,\ndemocracy advocates, and members of Falun Gong. 13\nAppendix 2\n154\nBusiness\nOne of the emerging debates in Canada concerns the future of China’s telecom giant,\nHuawei, which is widely believed to have links with China’s People’s Liberation Army.\nHuawei has little significant business in the United States and was recently banned from\nparticipating in Australia’s 5G wireless network project. Now Canada is debating that\nissue, despite the fact that the firm has established a vast network of relationships with\nall of Canada’s major telecom carriers and Canada’s leading research universities. Two\nformer directors of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service—Richard Fadden and\nWard Elcock—as well as John Adams, the former head of the Communications Security\nEstablishment (CSE), told the Globe and Mail in August that Canada should also ban\nHuawei from supplying equipment for a 5G network. 14\nUniversities\nAn example from academia suggests the efficacy of Canadian efforts to combat China’s\ninfluence operations. At one West Coast Canadian university with large numbers of\nstudents from the PRC in undergraduate humanities and social science courses, where\npotentially divergent views of China and Chinese political behavior regularly form\npart of the curriculum, there has been no observation of the pressures documented\nin Australia, where professors are often openly criticized by Chinese students for\nproposing less flattering ways of looking at China. However, at that university’s forprofit\n“international transition program,” which offers international students who\ndid not qualify for admission the chance (for a fee) to prepare to meet entrance\nrequirements, university administrators have generally failed to integrate the students\nwho are overwhelmingly PRC Chinese with poor English ability into the broader\ncampus community. The result is that, even without PRC consular pressure, there is a\nstrong pro-PRC culture of “political correctness” that conforms to United Front goals\nwithout the effort to promote it. It appears that social isolation is the driving factor in\nthis case.\nConclusion\nMuch of China’s influence activities in Canada are a legitimate extension of the\npublic diplomacy in which all nations engage. The pressing issue is when and where\nChina crosses the line between influence and interference. Canadian experience so\nfar suggests more influence work than interference. However, there are clear examples\nwhere such influence has become interference. So far, it would appear that the key\nvariable for the relatively low impact of Chinese state efforts (or proxies) turns out to\nbe Canadian practice more than Chinese state efforts. That is, the internal diversity\nof the Canadian Chinese community blunts political efforts by any one political\nparty (including the CCP). More generally, Canadian practices of multiculturalism,\nAppendix 2\n155\ntransparency, campaign financing rules, business regulation, and academic integrity\nare cultivated and fairly robust.\nThese experiences suggest the following solutions or best practices in the Canadian\ncase, which largely parallel the broader report’s findings:\n• Make clear public statements of Canadian values—political, economic, social, and\nacademic.\n• Insist on reciprocity with Chinese actors in each domain of engagement.\n• Identify what harms Canadian state, social, and community interests.\n• Strengthen the practice of Canadian values of multiculturalism, open society, and\nintegration.\n• Share experiences in each sector to build capacity and promote best practices,\nparticularly engaging the Canadian Chinese community.\n• Train and make use of area specialists to better understand PRC intentions (just as\nthe PRC relies on “Western” specialists).\nNOTES\n1 ​“Chinese Intelligence Services and

disposition toward\nChina historically, dating back to the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1964.\nYet, it is also the EU country where public opinion toward China is the most negative,\novertaking Italy in 2017. As in other countries, it is difficult to distinguish between the\nvoluntary exposure to influence by French seeking to benefit from China’s rise and\nactive efforts by Beijing to exploit French vulnerabilities.\nBoth the Left and Right in France have supported close ties with China. The dual\nnature of these ties differs from other European countries where for the most part\nthe Left has been critical of US policy in Asia and supportive of China and Vietnam.\nIn France’s case, it was the Right, under Charles de Gaulle, which recognized China\nin January 1964 and criticized US policy during the Vietnam War. So, for example, in\nJanuary 2014, an all-night celebration for the fiftieth anniversary of the recognition\nwas held in Paris with funding largely from major French firms operating in China.\nAppendix 2\n157\nBut it also means that French state television of the 1960s often aired views favorable\nto the Cultural Revolution, while Maoism was influential inside the radical Left.\nFrench diplomacy also has had its “China school,” with leading figures such as Etienne\nManach (a historical Gaullist) and Claude Martin (who recently published his memoirs\nunder a title lifted creatively from a saying by Chairman Mao, “La diplomatie n’est pas\nun dîner de gala” or “Diplomacy is not a dinner party”).\nStill, the shift in public opinion has been equally notable. Simon Leys wrote in French\nand spawned a critical tradition inside French sinology. The 1989 Tiananmen Square\ncrackdown and a demonstration condoned by the French government on the eve of the\nG-7 Versailles Summit created a lasting row with the PRC (to which arms sales to Taiwan\nin the early 1990s can be traced). President Nicolas Sarkozy’s stand on Tibet around the\n2008 Olympics kindled an even more severe controversy with China, one which also left\na trace inside French officialdom. Although diplomatic relations would be normalized\nin ensuing years, this marked the beginning of a rebalancing of France’s foreign policy\nin Asia. Today, France is a leading arms provider to Australia, Malaysia, Vietnam, India,\nSingapore, and—to a lesser degree—Japan. It is the leading country—and one of only\ntwo EU countries—participating in freedom of navigation naval operations in the South\nChina Sea, albeit with more limited objectives than the United States. It has also taken\nthe lead, with Germany and Italy, in calling for investment screening by the EU, a move\nthat clearly targets Chinese attempts to obtain European high technology.\nDiaspora\nThe Chinese diaspora in France is the largest in Europe, estimated to be between\nsix hundred thousand and one million. Exact figures are not known as ethnic or\nreligious censuses are banned in France. The diaspora is not only large but diverse,\nincluding Hoa refugees from Indochina arriving in the late 1970s, Wenzhou\nimmigrants, Dongbei workers, and, more recently, students and affluent Chinese.\nWenzhou immigrants are notably apolitical, while Dongbei (northeast) people are\ncloser to PRC traditions. Very few influential French of Chinese origins come from\neither of these two groups.\nThe PRC embassy in Paris and consulates in Marseilles and Strasbourg have increased\nChina’s outreach to the various Chinese communities in recent years. Notably, actions\nwere taken to encouraging and mobilizing counterdemonstrations (largely from the\nstudent community) in Paris during the 2008 Olympics row and by exploiting the issue\nof crime against Asians (tourists or residents). In 2016, the death of a Chinese resident\nat the hands of the police spawned a very sudden and publicly condoned reaction\nin China itself, an echo and perhaps a reminder of the 2008 Olympics row. The PRC\nalso has consulates in French Polynesia and on Reunion Island, with activities more\ndirected to communities of Chinese origin that reside there.\nAppendix 2\n158\nPublic figures from the second or third generation of immigrants are emerging\nslowly. The traditionally anticommunist sentiment in Paris’s thirteenth district,\npopulated by former refugees, has all but disappeared. The district’s Socialist Party\nMP, a former advocate of Taiwan, switched his sympathies to the PRC before leaving\npolitics in 2017. While France has always seen itself as a melting pot society—where\neven native languages dissolved over a generation—the economic attraction of China\nis clearly felt.\nPolice and judicial cooperation have also become an issue. In 2017, for the first time, a\nPRC citizen accused of corruption was extradited back to China; no public assurances\nwere given regarding a possible death penalty. Another case erupted when Chinese\npublic security officials made an unannounced visit to France to pressure a resident to\nreturn home and face charges.\nPolitics\nFor decades, China’s National Day reception has been the most sought-after\ndiplomatic reception in France, with queues often backing into the street. China’s\ndiplomatic buildings have in fact sprouted up around Paris, sometimes acquired\nfrom French government sites on sale. China has cultivated a stable of former French\npoliticians. Of particular interest to China is former prime minister Dominique\nde Villepin, who is a frequent visitor to the country. He has regularly made\npositive remarks to Chinese state media and at other fora regarding the Belt and\nRoad Initiative (BRI) and Chinese cooperation with the EU. In 2018, he became\na distinguished professor at China Europe International Business School and now\nheads its advisory board.\nCivil Society\nA new generation of NGOs linking French and PRC members and sponsors has\nemerged, complementing the traditional role of business. Most prominent is the\nFrance-China Foundation, guided by an active French diplomat and presided over by\ncurrent prime minister Edouard Philippe. With prominent PRC businessmen (such\nas Jack Ma) as cosponsors and old or new members of the French establishment (e.g.,\nformer prime minister Laurent Fabius and Cedric Villani, prominent mathematician\nand an MP since 2017), the foundation hosts social events, including at the Château\nde Versailles. Its strongest activity is a Young Leaders program that is patterned after\nthe traditional Fondation France-Amérique. Other organizations include the Fondation\nProspective et Innovation, headed by Jean-Pierre Raffarin, which awards a Wu Jianmin\nscholarship named after a former Chinese ambassador to France.\nAppendix 2\n159\nBusiness\nFrance maintains a negative trade balance with China and Chinese companies have\nnot invested much in France compared to what they’ve poured into Germany, Italy,\nand the United Kingdom. Chinese investors reduced investments during the 2016–17\npresidential campaign and have also met with informal refusals in some cases, such\nas Areva, the French nuclear company. The Chinese domestic market is set to save\nFrance’s dairy industry, even creating a temporary shortage of butter for the first time\nsince 1945. Still, complaints over too many purchases—or too many tourists, for that\nmatter–—are drowned out by the profits involved.\nIn mainland France, the Comité France-Chine of MEDEF, the French business union,\nhas always been a prominent link, usually spearheaded by a prominent former French\npolitical figure (from Raymond Barre to Valéry Giscard d’Estaing and Jean-Pierre\nRaffarin). A separate French-Chinese investment fund has also been created, headed by\na former senior official in the treasury department.\nUntil very recently, Sino-French activities were largely financed by major French firms\noperating in China, with EDF, the semipublic electricity company that cooperates on\nnuclear plants with China, being the most prominent. EDF has been criticized for its\ntransfers of technology to China, which it justifies by its contracts in China and the\nUnited Kingdom with Chinese co-funding. This pattern of lobbying by the French\nthemselves may be changing. Huawei now appears as a frequent donor, including\nfor public conferences taking place in such prestigious locales as the French National\nAssembly or Senate.\nQuiet Chinese investments with ownership below the 10 percent declaratory level, as\nwell as in real estate, make for more diffuse influence. This is particularly true at the\nlocal level, where Chinese investors are eagerly sought and business intermediaries\ntend to mushroom. Many plans for industrial parks and regional airports have not\nmaterialized, however. The partial takeover of the Toulouse airport (home of Airbus\nand other aerospace firms) has been marred by the temporary arrest in China of the\nlead Chinese investor and by a search for quick profits.\nAcademia\nIn general, French academic and scientific institutions have welcomed Chinese\nstudents and researchers. The Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique (CEA), Ecole\nPolytechnique, and the Paris Saclay cluster and science park are all active in working\nwith Chinese counterparts. The Paris Saclay cluster and science park has signed\nagreements with Tsinghua University and its commercial and high-tech spin-offs,\nQinghua Holdings and Qinghua Unigroup. The Fondation Franco-Chinoise pour la\nAppendix 2\n160\nScience et ses Applications, cofounded by the French and PRC Science Academies,\npromotes stays in France for Chinese scientists. It does not list any Chinese sponsoring\nfirm. Huawei has been a major donor to the Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques\n(IHES), France’s famous mathematics institution. The Fondation Victor Segalen is\na partnership between a French business school, ESCP, and China’s NDRC, and is\nsponsored by Huawei and a roster of French firms. Among the recent spate of Belt and\nRoad Initiative conferences, one at IRIS, a Paris-based think tank, was sponsored by the\nPRC embassy in France.\nMedia\nThe PRC now controls the only Chinese-language print media in France. Its TV channels\n(plus the Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV) are the only Chinese-language channels\ncarried to France and its overseas territories. In the French-language media, China does\nnot have a very strong position and the country’s officials deplore what they believe\nis negative reporting by French reporters. The PRC has had more success with the\npublishing world, where several books have appeared praising the Chinese model. The\nmost noted example is François Jullien, a literature professor turned philosopher who\nemphasizes that China’s thought is ”perpendicular to ours.” Jullien’s work is popular\namong China-oriented businessmen. Michel Aglietta, an anticapitalist economist,\npromotes China’s state-driven economy, while Philippe Barret, a former Maoist activist\nof the late 1960s turned government official and sovereigntist, published a book in\n2018 titled “N’ayez pas peur de la Chine” (“Do not fear China”).\nGERMANY\nChina has so far made only a few conspicuous efforts to exert improper interference\nin German politics, society, and business. 1 Those that have occurred, however, deserve\nattention, and, coupled with the overwhelming resources dedicated to nominally\nlegitimate influence activities, will demand a coherent counterstrategy over time.\nChinese influence activities in Germany seem sophisticated even though they\ncurrently do not appear very effective. The problem from the Chinese point of view\nis that German public opinion and its media are traditionally critical of the Chinese\nleadership. The Tiananmen Square massacre still plays an outsize role in Germans’\npublic perception of China as it fell on the same year that East Germany began to\nopen up. Thus, instead of launching a PR campaign to play on German skepticism of\nthe United States (for example), as China does elsewhere, Chinese agencies have so far\nconfined themselves to: (a) targeting younger persons—those who have a professional\nor academic interest in China; (b) weakening the EU and thus subverting a crucial\nfoundation of Germany’s influence; and (c) directing their major thrust at the one part\nAppendix 2\n161\nof German society that has a clear interest in good German-Chinese relations and thus\nis susceptible to Chinese influence: the business community.\nWhile this report has focused on distinguishing legitimate influence efforts from\nimproper interference, it is important to acknowledge behavior that is unquestionably\nillegal. Most acts of espionage have not become public knowledge. Occasionally there\nare unconfirmed reports about cyber activities and Chinese IT hardware containing\ndevices enabling espionage. In December 2017, German authorities revealed that\nChinese agents had used faked LinkedIn identities or avatars of Germans engaged with\nChina to contact people in the political and media spheres.\nPolitics\nAngela Merkel, the present chancellor, has a decidedly cool attitude toward China,\nalthough she has established mechanisms to work closely with China over the years.\nPossibly because of her experience of being raised in communist East Germany, Merkel\nclearly sees the challenges presented by China to democracy and a liberal society.\nIndeed, there’s an argument to be made that with the retreat of the United States\nfrom human rights issues, Germany has taken up the mantle as the strongest critic\nof China’s human rights practices. It was Merkel’s government that won the release\nof Liu Xia, the widow of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo. Thus, it makes sense\nthat the Chinese Communist Party has opted to plant a seed within the German\nbusiness elite with the hope that in a post-Merkel Germany, China’s interests would be\naccommodated more than now.\nGermany is also an indirect target of China’s efforts directed at the 16—1 group\nin Central Europe and within the EU. Among the sixteen Central and Eastern\nEuropean countries (eleven of them EU member states) gathered in the 16—1 group,\nthe expectation of Chinese investment has led to laxer application of EU rules on\nprocurement and in some cases to opposition to joint EU criticism of China (e.g.,\nconcerning the South China Sea, human rights, and the Belt and Road Initiative).\nChinese “divide and rule” activities weaken the EU’s China policy and the EU’s\ncohesion in general and thus affect Germany negatively. 2\nThere have been limited conspicuous efforts to target specific politicians for\ncultivation, with two notable exceptions: former chancellor Helmut Schmidt (now\ndeceased) and former minister of economics Philipp Roessler. Influence activities\ndirected toward political parties are negligible, apart from efforts to include them in\nevents on the Belt and Road Initiative and the recent commemoration of forty years\nof the policy of Reform and Opening. There have been some attempts to establish\nrelations with the new right-wing party “Alternative für Deutschland.”\nAppendix 2\n162\nIn 2016, the chair of the Human Rights Committee of the German Parliament was\ntold he would not be allowed to visit China with the rest of the committee if he did\nnot delete a report from his home page on Tibetan flags being hoisted at German town\nhalls. The committee refused to go on the trip.\nAcademia\nMore than one hundred thousand Chinese nationals live in Germany, most of them\nstudents. Intense exchanges take place between universities, research institutes,\nand think tanks, as well as between scholars in many areas, both natural and social\nsciences. Similar to academics from other countries, several German researchers and\nacademics with a reputation of being critical toward the Chinese government have\nbeen denied visas or access to interlocutors in China. China in general targets junior\nscholars for cultivation. Contacts are initiated from China with invitations to join\nresearch projects, apply for grants, attend conferences, and write articles with the\npromise that they will be published.\nA notable instance of coercion occurred when the publishing company Springer Nature\nremoved an estimated one thousand publications from its Internet catalog for China\nbecause their titles might not coincide with official political positions of Beijing. So far,\nSpringer has yet to reverse its decision, unlike Cambridge University Press in a similar\ninstance.\nGerman universities host twenty Confucius Institutes (out of approximately 160 in\nall of Europe). Like their counterparts elsewhere, they invest more in gaining general\nsympathy in German civil society through cultural activities than in advancing an\novertly political agenda (which does occur, although rarely). There are fifty-eight\nChinese Students and Scholars Associations in Germany that are well organized and\nseemingly well funded.\nCivil Society\nChinese officials regularly complain about the negative attitude toward China in the\nGerman public, proven by polls, but do not yet tackle the problem directly. Activities\nin the PRC by German nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and political\nfoundations are increasingly confined in their activities, not only through China’s\nnew NGO law but also because former Chinese partners are reluctant to cooperate.\nIn a letter to the interior ministries of German federal states, the Chinese embassy\nrequested that communities be asked not to hoist Tibetan flags on Tibet Day\n(March 10). In some cases, ministries complied, but in the majority of cases they\ndid not. Almost none of the communities complied. The Chinese embassy in Berlin\nAppendix 2\n163\nintervened with hotels where activities involving Taiwan (such as trade shows) flew\nthe flag of the Republic of China. Probably in view of the costs incurred by cancelling\na contract with their Taiwanese partners, the addressees in general did not comply.\nIn a similar incident, at the first of a series of tournaments between German third\nleague soccer clubs and Chinese soccer clubs, the Chinese coach demanded that\nspectators be forbidden from holding up Tibetan flags. The German soccer association’s\nrepresentative did not comply and no more football matches have been held.\nBusiness\nClose relationships, often decades old, between various enterprises and business\nassociations (including a newly established one on the Belt and Road Initiative) are\nnurtured by the Chinese embassy, consulates, and representatives from Beijing. The\nChinese government provides financial and logistical support for events like the\nHamburg Summit or Asia Pacific Days in Berlin. A long-standing practice has been to\ninclude CEOs of major enterprises in advisory boards of mayors of major Chinese cities\nand provinces (remuneration seems not to play a role).\nThe issue of “weaponized” investment is growing in importance. In 2016, Chinese\ncompanies spent 12.5 billion euros on investments in Germany—about as much as the\ntotal investment of the entire previous decade. The main targets have been successful\ntechnology companies. The blitz has subsided in the wake of greater political scrutiny\nbeginning in 2017 and German efforts, along with those of the United Kingdom and\nFrance, to limit China’s ability to buy, borrow, or steal leading European technology.\nGerman enterprises in both China and Germany are major targets for information\ncampaigns related to the Belt and Road Initiative. Enterprises generally respond\npositively although with circumspection (only 36 percent of German companies in\nChina expect positive effects for their business). Especially large enterprises (e.g.,\nSiemens) have played along and created their own “BRI Task Forces.” Siemens CEO\nJoe Kaeser said in Davos in 2018 that the Belt and Road would become the “new\nWTO.” Similar to instances elsewhere, when the Daimler company used a quote from\nthe Dalai Lama on its Instagram account, it was confronted with massive protests in\nChina’s media and it apologized publicly—twice—to China. The city of Duisburg (one\nof the terminals of the trans-Eurasian railroads) in January 2018 reached a “strategic\ncooperation” agreement with Huawei to turn Duisburg into a “smart city.” That entailed\nhaving Huawei build a “Rhine Cloud” to host Duisburg’s data. 3\nMedia\nGerman media have, for decades, been the target of official and unofficial Chinese\ncriticism that they are “anti-Chinese.” China’s state-run media have sought to\nAppendix 2\n164\nmake some inroads into the mainstream German press. China Daily’s advertisement\nsupplement, China Watch, is published in only one daily, after readers protested its\ninclusion in another paper. In 2017, China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency partnered\nwith a German firm, the German Television News Agency or DFA, to provide soft\nfeatures about how important China is to Germany. Called Nihao Deutschland, the\nprogram has been criticized as propaganda in the mainstream German press. 4\nReaction\nIt is in business, the one area of tangible Chinese influence efforts, where pushback\nhas begun in Germany. Chancellor Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron\nhave initiated discussions with businesses and the EU Commission on ways to\nestablish stricter investment screening procedures and to push for more reciprocity for\nEuropean firms in China. In April 2018, the second chamber of the German parliament\n(representing the federal states) passed a resolution to lower the threshold at which the\ngovernment may intervene in foreign direct investment (FDI) projects in Germany.\nThe measure was clearly targeted at China. As for the EU, the German government has\nsupported language that criticizes the BRI concept for hampering free trade and putting\nChinese companies at an advantage. 5\nConclusion\nMany of the coercive actions documented here are for the most part measures one\nmight imagine German diplomats abroad also adopting. What raises questions are\nthe size of China’s activities and its objectives. China can wield massive resources in\npushing its public diplomacy agenda. This can turn German and European partners\ninto pawns. The outsize dimension of China’s influence efforts can render them\nimproper or even illegitimate. China’s efforts on the investment side often involve\ndraining technical know-how from German firms. On the political side, its support of\nCentral European countries has been carried out with the aim of dividing the primary\npolitical organization of Europe, the EU. Neither of these can be regarded as proper and\nlegitimate behavior between states.\nThe risk of Chinese interference in Germany is serious in the medium to long term,\neven though so far it is mainly an indirect one and German society by and large has\nproven sufficiently resilient. A preliminary recommendation on how to prevent the\nproblem from becoming more serious would be to focus on more cohesion, exchange,\nand transparency among countries concerned, first of all within the EU. This will\ntake time and effort, considering that some countries in Europe (such as a few Eastern\nEuropean nations along with Greece) hope to use their support of China’s political or\ntechnological goals to lure Chinese investment. Still, as a leader of Europe, Germany—\nalong with France—needs to initiate a broad-based discussion among the public and\nAppendix 2\n165\nthe business community about the challenge presented by China’s economy and\npolitical system and its objectives.\nNOTES\n1 ​The recent reports by ECFR and Merics/GPPI list some of them, but mainly deal with Europe in general:\nFrancois Godement and Abigael Vasselier, “China at the Gates: A New Power Audit of EU-China Relations,”\nEuropean Council on Foreign Relations, December 1, 2017, accessed October 11, 2018, http:// www​. ecfr​. eu​\n/publications​/summary​/china​_eu​_power​_audit7242; and Thorsten Benner, Jan Gaspers, Mareike Ohlberg,\nLucrezia Poggetti, and Kristin Shi-Kupfer, “Authoritarian Advance: Responding to China’s Growing Political\nInfluence in Europe,” MERICS, February 2018.\n2 ​Then foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel on August 30, 2017, in a speech asked China to respect the “One\nEurope Principle” as much as it demands Europeans respect the “One China Principle.”\n3 ​Achim Sawall, “Duisburg und Huawei Starten die Rhine Cloud,” Golem.de, June 11, 2018, accessed\nOctober 11, 2018, https://www​.golem​.de​/news​/du​-it​-duisburg​-und​-huawei​-starten​-die​-rhine​-cloud​-1806​\n- 134892​. html.\n4 ​“ ‘Nihao Deutschland’ Zeigt Deutschen China,” Hamburger Abendblatt, August 8, 2017, accessed\nOctober 11, 2018, https:// www​. abendblatt​. de​/ kultur​- live​/ tv​- und​- medien​/ article211511923​/ Nihao​\n- Deutschland​- zeigt​- Deutschen​- China​. html.\n5 ​Dana Heide, Till Hoppe, Klaus Stratman, and Stephan Scheur, “EU Ambassadors Band Together Against\nSilk Road,” Handelsblatt, April 17, 2018, accessed October 11, 2018, https://global​.handelsblatt​.com​/politics​\n/ eu​- ambassadors​- beijing​- china​- silk​- road​- 912258.\nJAPAN\nJapan would seem to be the perfect target for the Chinese party-state and its under-theradar\nefforts to turn potential adversaries into benign friends. Japan has deep cultural\nand emotional ties with China, through history, language, and art, and a sense of Asian\nfraternity forged by their struggles to keep intrusive, overbearing Western powers at\nbay. Many in Japan also carry an enduring sense of remorse for their country’s brutal\nsubjugation of China in the opening half of the twentieth century. However, the\nkinds of covert Chinese influence operations that have come to light in countries like\nthe United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Europe—with one\nexception—are not easy to find in Japan.\nA natural place to look for evidence of influence-peddling would be in Chinese\nsupport for the left-wing Japanese peace groups that have long investigated and\npublished evidence of the Imperial Army’s war atrocities in the 1930s and 1940s.\nSuch Japanese research has been politically useful for China in buttressing its own\nefforts to chronicle the sufferings of its people during the conflict, as well as lending\nsupport to Beijing’s tussling with Tokyo over how the history of the war should be\nmanaged and told.\nAppendix 2\n166\nBut Japanese activists have never needed encouragement from China on this front.\nThey lead homegrown movements with specific political targets in Japan itself,\nnotably attacking the conservative establishment and defending the country’s “peace\nconstitution.” These well-established groups, the origins of which lie in the Cold War\nsplits of 1950s Japanese politics, have long been attacked from the right in Japan for\nbeing unpatriotic. But none has been linked credibly to Beijing’s United Front Work\nDepartment. Nor is there evidence that they have been manipulated and managed by\nCCP-aligned or directed interests.\nThe Japanese Communist Party, which still retains a substantial electoral base, is little\nhelp to Beijing on the ground in Japan. The JCP was pro-Soviet through the Cold War\nand has no special affinity with Beijing.\nJapan’s cultural and institutional familiarity with China makes it, in different\nways, less amenable to Chinese influence than it would appear to be at first blush.\nAfter all, Japan has absorbed much from China over many centuries, taking in\nwhat it wanted and adapting it to its own ends, and keeping out much else. On\ntop of that, any notions of Asian solidarity have been subverted since the early\ntwentieth century by war and politics and by the failure of the two countries to\nreach an equilibrium in the aftermath of Japan’s defeat in 1945 and the victory of\nthe Chinese communists in 1949.\nProductive Back Channels\nThe opaque political cultures of both countries have shaped the way that bilateral\nrelations are conducted. Aside from conventional diplomacy, leaders of the dominant\npolitical parties in China and Japan have extensively used back channels to establish\nunderstandings on sensitive issues, including the overt use of CCP organs, outside of\nnormal state-to-state relations.\nThe Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, headed by\nLi Xiaolin, the daughter of former Chinese president Li Xiannian, has long been\na forum through which the two sides have conducted dialogues. The Friendship\nAssociation is effectively the public face of the CCP’s UFWD. It is not covert and,\nfor all the connotations conjured up in its name, it remains avowedly an arm of the\nparty-state. In that respect, the Friendship Association remains a reliable conduit for\npassing messages between the two countries, especially at a time, as in recent years,\nwhen senior-level political exchanges have been fraught. When bilateral relations\nfroze in 2012 after the clash over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, it was a measure of\nhow dangerous things became that the back channels, or the “pipes,” as the Japanese\ndescribe them, froze, making diplomatic signaling difficult across the East China Sea.\nAppendix 2\n167\nOkinawa and Senkaku/Diaoyu Debates\nThe clearest case of covert meddling occurs far south of Tokyo in Okinawa, the\nancient island-kingdom which is geographically closer to Taiwan than it is to the\nJapanese mainland. As late as 2015, prominent Chinese were asserting that the Ryukyu\nIslands, which include Okinawa, belonged as much to Beijing as they did to Japan. In\nlarge part, they based their argument on the fact that the chain was once a Chinese\ntributary state. The two countries still hotly contest this island chain, known as\nSenkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. “I am not saying all former tributary states\nbelong to China, but we can say with certainty that the Ryukyus do not belong to\nJapan,” wrote Luo Yuan, a retired and hawkish People’s Liberation Army general. 1\nChinese scholars have argued that Japan’s annexation of the islands in 1879 was an\ninvasion and that the sovereignty of the island chain is thus open to question. For the\ntime being, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has not pressed this issue.\nHong Kong has long been a base for flag-waving Chinese activists agitating on the issue\nof the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. Their appeals to a notion of Chinese brotherhood,\ncombined with the fact the group writes in traditional Chinese characters, suggests\nthat the main consumers of the Organizing Committee for the Ryukyus propaganda\nmay not be on mainland China. Instead, the Organizing Committee may well be\ntargeting supporters of the Kuomintang in Taiwan, where hard core supporters of\nunification have become marginalized in mainstream politics, or overseas Chinese\ncommunities. 2\nIt is of some significance that the same individuals who make up the Organizing\nCommittee are also listed online as serving in CCP United Front Work Department\npositions in Hong Kong. 3 The Organizing Committee for the Ryukyus also has a robust\nonline presence, with both a website and a Weibo (similar to Twitter) account. 4 It is\nworth noting, also, that the Hong Kong-based campaign to regain the Ryukyus has not\nwon any overt or consistent support from Beijing.\nBut the Hong Kong patriots’ campaign has the benefit of being aligned with anti-\nJapanese sentiment in Okinawa itself, where both political leaders and the local media\nare antagonistic toward Tokyo. The local discontent is directly related to the longstanding\npresence of tens of thousands of US military personnel stationed on the\nisland and the ways in which they have interacted with the indigenous population.\nOperating at arm’s length from the government, however, a cabal of self-styled\nChinese patriots in Hong Kong has openly agitated for the Ryukus (Senkaku/Diaoyu)\nto be taken from Japan and to become part of China. The main group calls itself the\n“Organizing Committee for the Ryukyu Islands Special Administrative Region of the\nAppendix 2\n168\nChinese Race.” 5 Hong Kong has long been a base for flag-waving Chinese activists\nagitating on the issue of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. “The Chinese race does not\nfight wars. The Chinese race only safeguards peace!” runs one pronouncement which\nwas designed as an outreach to potential supporters on Okinawa. “The Chinese race\nis relying on you. The Chinese race today relies on you, and the Chinese race can\nrely on you.” 6 Even more extreme is the way that the group frames its assertion that\nthe Ryukus (Senkaku/Diaoyu) should become part of China. “The Japanese people\nare a part of the Chinese race and Japan is originally of Chinese blood,” the group’s\npresident, Zhao Dong, says in one posting.\nFor the CCP in Beijing, with an eye on the long game, building links between\nmalcontents in Okinawa and patriots in Hong Kong could easily pay off in the future.\nCountering Chinese Influence\nThe Japanese government has been at the forefront of attempts to counter Chinese\nefforts for influence throughout Asia. It maintains a robust, if under-the-radar,\nrelationship with Taiwan. It has strong ties to Vietnam and it has attempted to\nmodify China’s influence over Cambodia and Laos, although to little effect. Japan\nhas a close relationship with New Delhi that involves not simply trade but also\nsecurity. Japan and India recently unveiled the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor as a\nway to compete with Chinese influence in Africa. Japan’s ties to Australia are deep\nas well. 7 Japan’s government was the source of the expression “Free and open Indo-\nPacific” as a counterpoint to China’s attempts to turn the Western Pacific (or at least\nthe South China Sea) into a Chinese lake. Moreover, Japanese firms currently are\noutpacing Chinese firms in terms of infrastructure investment in Southeast Asia.\nNOTES\n1 ​Justin McCurry, “China Lays Claim to Okinawa as Territory Dispute with Japan Escalates,” Guardian (UK),\nMay 15, 2013, https:// www​. theguardian​. com​/ world​/ 2013​/ may​/ 15​/ china​- okinawa​- dispute​- japan​- ryukyu.\n2 ​Taiwanese newspapers have already covered the Organizing Committee in a rather disparaging fashion:\n“Pushing Japan to Hand Back the Ryukyus: Chinese People Draw up an International Lawsuit,” “ 促日歸還琉\n球中國人擬告上國際法庭 ,” Liberty Times (Taiwan), August 2, 2016, accessed October 11, 2018, http:// news​. ltn​\n. com​. tw​/ news​/ world​/ paper​/ 1017100.\n3 ​“China Brilliant Cause Investment Group CCTV International News Introduction,” Yanzhao Nightly/\nShijiazhuang Daily, accessed October 11, 2018, http://www​.hnqxgs​.com​/yzwbfz​/2196344​.html.\n4 ​“Organising Committee for the Ryukyu Islands Special Administrative Region of the Chinese Race,”\nWeibo, accessed October 11, 2018, https://www​.weibo​.com​/u​/1931192953​?is​_hot​=​1.\n5 ​Ryukyu Network, Organising Committee for the Special Administrative Region of the Chinese Race,\naccessed October 11, 2018, http://www​.ryukyu​-china​.com.\nAppendix 2\n169\n6 ​“ 中華民族琉球特別自治区」の正体は . . . ​ 中国共産党中央統一戦線工作部 ,” Japan+, November 10, 2015,\naccessed October 11, 2018, http://japan​-plus​.net​/952.\n7 ​Daniel Moss, “As China Steps Up, Japan Isn’t Stepping Aside,” Bloomberg, July 10, 2018, accessed October 11,\n2018, https://www​.bloomberg​.com​/view​/articles​/2018​-07​-10​/japan​-reasserts​-influence​-as​-china​-rises.\nNEW ZEALAND\nThe issue of Chinese influence operations in New Zealand began to attract significant\nattention in September 2017 when Anne-Marie Brady, a professor at the University of\nCanterbury, published a detailed assessment of that country’s experience in the weeks\nprior to national elections. 1\nChina’s influence operations in New Zealand are rooted in the same set of policies\nand institutions that guide its work globally, often proceeding outward from efforts\ntargeted at the diaspora community. As has been observed elsewhere, influence\noperations in New Zealand have increased markedly since Xi Jinping became general\nsecretary of the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese government considers New\nZealand an “exemplar of how it would like its relations to be with other states.” 2 One\nunnamed Chinese diplomat even characterized relations between the two countries as\nsimilar to China’s close ties with totalitarian Albania in the early 1960s.\nNew Zealand is of strategic interest to China for several reasons. As a claimant state in\nAntarctica, the country is relevant to China’s growing ambitions in that territory. It\nmanages the defense and foreign affairs of three other territories in the South Pacific.\nIt is an ideal location for near-space research and has unexplored oil and gas resources.\nMost critically, as a member of the “Five Eyes” security partnerships with the United\nStates, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, New Zealand offers enormous\npossibilities for Chinese espionage.\nNew Zealand is particularly vulnerable to Chinese influence because it is a small state\nof 4.5 million people with strong trade ties to China. China is New Zealand’s second\nlargest trading partner and a critical market for two of its most important sectors,\ntourism and milk products. It should be noted that New Zealand has historically\npursued closer ties with China than many other nations. What is changing is the\nwillfulness with which China appears ready to exploit this dynamic and to subvert\nNew Zealand’s continued ability to independently shape its policy priorities.\nExamples of improper influence in New Zealand include revelations that a member of\nParliament concealed that he had been involved with Chinese military intelligence for\nfifteen years prior to immigrating to New Zealand; a New Zealand company found to\nAppendix 2\n170\nbe violating bans on exports to North Korea via its Chinese partner; and the almost\ncomplete domination of local Chinese-language media by pro-PRC outlets.\nChinese Diaspora\nThere are currently two hundred thousand ethnic Chinese in New Zealand, primarily\nconcentrated in Auckland. During the Cold War, Chinese New Zealanders “were neither\npro-CCP nor pro-PRC” and its community institutions were “proudly independent.”\nNow, few activities are noticeably independent of Beijing.\nIn addition to its embassy in Wellington, Beijing coordinates its engagement with the\ndiaspora through an Overseas Chinese Service Center, established in Auckland in 2014.\nThe organization considered most closely connected with PRC authorities in New\nZealand is the Peaceful Reunification of China Association of New Zealand, which was\nfounded in 2000. Controlled by the United Front Work Department, it has encouraged\nbloc voting in the ethnic Chinese community, fund-raising for friendly ethnic Chinese\npolitical candidates, and organizing of protests. The current leader of the association,\na businessman in the food industry, also heads or has leadership roles in other United\nFront organizations in New Zealand and has been publicly listed as an adviser to the\nBeijing Overseas Chinese Affairs Council.\nSeveral current ethnic Chinese individuals active in New Zealand work “very publicly”\nwith China’s United Front Organizations in New Zealand. 3 In return they have\nbenefited from fund-raising events held by the Peaceful Reunification Association,\nwhich has encouraged ethnic Chinese to vote for them. In the 2017 elections, a woman\nwho led the New Zealand Chinese Students and Scholars Association was placed on\nthe Labour Party’s election slate, but the party did not receive enough votes for her to\nenter Parliament. Chinese individuals active in New Zealand politics have also attended\nPeaceful Reunification Association meetings, where they stated their intention to\npromote China’s policies with respect to Tibet, promoted a think tank tied to the Belt\nand Road Initiative, and repeated slogans from Xi Jinping in local campaign materials.\nPolitics\nIn 2017, it was disclosed that Yang Jian, who to date remains a member of\nParliament, concealed that he had been a student and teacher at two of China’s\nmilitary intelligence colleges for fifteen years before immigrating to New Zealand.\nHe omitted this history on his English-language resume for his position at a New\nZealand university, his permanent residency and citizenship applications, and his\nparliamentary position, but he disclosed it selectively to those speaking Chinese.\nYang has acknowledged the veracity of these reports, including that he was a member\nof the Chinese Communist Party, but claims he ceased his affiliation after leaving\nAppendix 2\n171\nthe country in 1994. Since entering government, Yang “has been a central figure\npromoting and helping to shape the New Zealand National government’s China\nstrategy” and was a member of the Parliamentary Select Committee for Foreign Affairs,\nDefense, and Trade from 2014 to 2016, which would have given him privileged access\nto information. 4\nChinese influence efforts targeted toward New Zealand politics transcend the diaspora\ncommunity to include campaign contributions and the cultivation of relationships with\nformer senior officials. Individuals with strong ties to United Front organizations have\ndonated several million dollars, primarily to the National Party. One such individual, who\ndonated $112,000 to the National Party in 2017, is listed as an officer of no fewer than\nseven United Front organizations. 5 Senior politicians who have secured high-profile roles\nin Chinese companies include a former party leader and members of Parliament who\nserve on the boards of the New Zealand affiliates of major Chinese banks. A former\nminister of finance serves on the board of a majority-Chinese-owned New Zealand\ndairy. In late September, a former prime minister who now represents an American\ncompany’s interests in China attracted attention for the sale of property “well above\nmarket rates” to an undisclosed Chinese buyer. Local politicians have also been\ntargeted.\nBusiness\nChinese companies have also been instruments of interference in New Zealand. After\nacquiring a stake in a local telecom company in 2011, Chinese telecom giant Huawei\nwent on to win the contract to build New Zealand’s 4G wireless network in 2013.\nHuawei also established research partnerships and other investments in the country\nthat may be leveraged for nonbusiness purposes. In another instance, New Zealand\naeronautics company Pacific Aerospace in 2014 partnered with Beijing Automotive\nGroup on the sale of planes to the Chinese market. In 2017, Pacific Aerospace was\ncharged by New Zealand Customs with knowingly and illegally exporting parts to\nNorth Korea via its Chinese partner.\nUniversities\nNew Zealand has long-standing scientific cooperation agreements with China, most\nof which are benign. However, since China renewed an emphasis on civil-military\nresearch integration in 2015, New Zealand, like other countries hosting major\nresearch institutions, has been targeted for its potential to further these aims. New\nZealand universities have partnerships with several Chinese universities linked to\nChina’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), including the PLA Institute of Military\nCulture (Massey); the National University of Defense Technology (Auckland, Massey);\nNorthwestern Polytechnical University (Canterbury), Shenyang Aerospace University\nAppendix 2\n172\n(UNITEC), and Xidian University (Otago, VUW). New Zealand regularly hosts doctoral\nstudents who were graduates of these universities and also hosts current students\nand staff on short-term fellowships. Some New Zealand academics have roles at PLAlinked\nuniversities. The potential for these relationships to be exploited requires a\nreevaluation of government policies on scientific exchange. 6\nCivil Society\nMedia are a key target of China’s influence efforts. New Zealand’s local Chineselanguage\noutlets all have content cooperation agreements with China’s Xinhua News\nService, participate in annual media training conferences in China, have at times\nemployed senior staff affiliated with the Communist Party, and have hosted CCP\npropaganda officials. CCP officials have given direct editorial instructions to Chineselanguage\nmedia in New Zealand as part of the CCP’s strategy to blend overseas\ncontent with that in the PRC. On television, a Chinese-language channel has removed\nTaiwanese programming from its network. Xinhua has also established its own\ntelevision station.\nWith respect to English media, China Daily in 2016 established a partnership with\nthe Fairfax newspapers in Australia and New Zealand. The Chinese embassy has\nsponsored the travel of journalists and politicians. In other instances, donors with\nclose connections to the Chinese government have donated to organizations that\nprovide research funding and subsidize journalist and youth visits to China, as well as\nexhibitions, book publications, and other activities that “promote a non-critical view\nof China.”\nChina’s representatives in New Zealand also put considerable pressure on New\nZealanders who speak up critically on China-related issues. Since publication of her\ninitial report on Chinese influence operations in the country, Anne-Marie Brady\nhas experienced break-ins at her office and home, according to testimony before the\nAustralian Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee. 7\nConclusion\nNew Zealand’s government, unlike that of Australia, has taken few steps to counter\nforeign interference in its internal affairs. Charity fund-raising, which has been used\nby Chinese United Front organizations to mask contributions, remains excluded from\ndisclosure requirements. New Zealand’s intelligence service still cannot investigate\ncases of subversion and foreign influence inside its political parties without the\napproval of the service’s minister, whose political calculations may inhibit action. And\nmedia regulations remain inadequate to address improper influence by means other\nthan outright ownership, which may also merit reform.\nAppendix 2\n173\nNOTES\n1 ​Anne-Marie Brady, “Magic Weapons: China’s Political Influence Activities under Xi Jinping,” Kissinger\nInstitute on China and the United States, September 18, 2017, accessed October 11, 2018, https:// www​\n. wilsoncenter​. org​/ article​/ magic​- weapons​- chinas​- political​- influence​- activities​- under​- xi​- jinping.

Singapore is also unique in Southeast Asia\nbecause its rigorous standards of governance and zero tolerance for corruption make it\nvirtually impossible to bribe or openly suborn political leaders or opinion-leaders.\nIn 2016–17, Singapore’s generally friendly, smooth relationship with China took a\ndownturn. The proximate cause was Singapore becoming country coordinator for\nChina for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). This post is held\nby ASEAN member states by rotation for a three-year term. China seemed to have\nconvinced itself that the role entailed Singapore “coordinating” ASEAN’s position on\nthe South China Sea (SCS) territorial disputes in its favor. But China has long been\nunhappy with Singapore’s clear and consistent position on the SCS. Singapore is not a\nclaimant state to the South China Sea. The previous country coordinator was Vietnam,\na claimant state whose relationship with China has been historically fraught. Chinese\nexpectations of Singapore may have been unrealistically high, particularly after the\nArbitral Tribunal on the case brought by the Philippines against China ruled against\nChina’s position in a verdict in July 2016.\nChina criticized Singapore’s support for SCS disputes being resolved in accordance with\ninternational law as “taking sides.” It objected to Singapore’s leaders and officials even\nspeaking on the SCS issue. When Singapore stood firm on its right to state its position\non an issue of undoubted importance to the region, the Chinese influence apparatus\nAppendix 2\n174\nwas activated to pressure the government to change position. Singapore’s experience in\n2016–17 holds lessons for other ASEAN member states.\nOn the surface, China claims that it does not interfere in the internal affairs of other\nstates. At the same time, it is led by a Leninist party that embraces the ideas of the\nUnited Front as a key tactic. Translated into foreign policy, by its nature United Front\nwork involves lobbying, coercion, co-optation and other influence operations—some\nof which are legitimate, others of which are not. China’s self-declared role as the\nrepresentative of all Chinese people around the world and its stated position that all\nChinese are obliged to help China further complicate its position in Singapore, which\nis 76 percent Chinese.\nThis multifaceted and contradictory approach is deployed within an overarching\nnarrative of China’s inevitable and unstoppable rise and America’s equally inevitable\nand absolute decline. This narrative and others are propagated by various means:\nWeChat with Chinese-speaking populations, social and mainstream media, whispering\ncampaigns, business, clan, and cultural associations, and conventional agents of\ninfluence reporting to Chinese intelligence organizations, who cultivate what Lenin\ncalled “useful idiots.”\nA History of Influence\nChinese influence operations in Singapore are not a recent phenomenon. China’s\nUnited Front activities in the late 1950s and 1960s sought to export China’s communist\nrevolution to Southeast Asia and were part of an open political struggle. But even after\nChina’s proxies in the political contest were defeated, China continued to try to shape\npublic opinion in Singapore. This attempt differed from the 2016–17 episode mainly in\nthe means deployed, which reflected the technologies available at the time.\nOn May 15, 1971, the Singapore government announced the arrest and detention of\nthree individuals under the Internal Security Act. The government press statement\nrevealed that “officials of a communist intelligence service based in Hong Kong”\nhad between 1964 and 1968 given loans totaling more than 7 million Hong Kong\ndollars at the “ridiculously low interest rate of 0.1% per annum” to an ethnic Chinese\nbusinessman to start an English-language daily newspaper named the Eastern Sun. 1 The\nnewspaper commenced publication in 1966. In return for the loans, the Eastern Sun was\nrequired not to oppose the PRC on major issues and to remain neutral on minor issues.\nIn 2004, China deployed intense pressure on Singapore when then deputy prime\nminister Lee Hsien Loong paid an unofficial visit to Taiwan. The Chinese were trying\nto get Singapore to cancel the visit. Singapore adheres to a “One China Policy,” but if\nAppendix 2\n175\nChina had succeeded, it would have forced a significant modification of Singapore’s\napproach to Taiwan.\nThis was not the first unofficial visit by a Singaporean leader to Taiwan. Previous\nunofficial visits by even more senior Singapore leaders had passed without incident.\nThe 2004 visit conformed to the established pattern in form and substance of previous\nvisits. But what the 2004 incident had in common with the 2016–17 episode was that\nboth occurred at times of political transition in Singapore.\nIn 2004, it was clear that Lee Hsien Loong would replace Goh Chok Tong as\nSingapore’s third prime minister. By 2016, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had made\npublic his intention to step aside after the next general election (due by 2020) and let\na younger generation of political leaders take over. The pressures deployed on both\noccasions may have been intended as tests of the resolve of new leaders and warnings\nto new leaders about what to expect unless they were more accommodating to China.\nSouth China Sea\nWhen Singapore became the ASEAN country coordinator in 2016, Chinese diplomats\ncalled upon Singapore to “explain” China’s position on the SCS to other ASEAN\ncountries, or to ensure that the issue was not raised in ASEAN forums, or, if raised,\ndownplayed. Such demarches have been routine in all ASEAN countries for many years.\nSimultaneously, messages targeting civil society and other sectors began to appear,\nmost prominently on social media. The aim was to instill a fatalistic acceptance of the\ninevitability and desirability of a Chinese identity for multiracial Singapore and to get\nSingaporeans—and not just Chinese Singaporeans—to pressure the government to\nalign Singapore’s national interests with China’s interests. In essence, they asserted:\n• Unlike Lee Kuan Yew, who had died in 2015, the current Singapore leadership\nunder Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong did not know how to deal with China.\nRelations were so much better then.\n• Singapore has no territorial claims in the SCS, so why was it siding with the\nUnited States against China?\n• Surely, as a “Chinese country,” Singapore should “explain” China’s position to the\nothers or stay neutral.\nIt is difficult to pin down the precise origins of such narratives, but they closely\nresemble arguments made in the Chinese media, in particular the Global Times.\nAppendix 2\n176\nOmitted was the historical fact that Lee Kuan Yew was the only noncommunist\nleader who in the late 1950s and early 1960s went into a CCP-backed United Front\norganization and emerged the victor. That drew a red line, which provided the basis on\nwhich Lee and his successors developed Singapore’s relations with China. Also ignored\nwas the fact that even though Singapore has no territorial claims on the SCS, that does\nnot mean it has no interest there. And, most crucial of all, although the majority of\nSingaporeans are ethnic Chinese, Singapore is a multiracial country organized on the\nbasis of meritocracy and it does not view itself as a mono-racial state like China.\nStill, many Singaporeans, only cursorily interested in international affairs, did\nnot realize they were being fed oversimplifications and swallowed them, or played\nalong for other reasons. Businessmen, academics, and others with interests in China\nwere given broad hints that their interests might suffer unless Singapore was more\naccommodating, and they passed the messages to the Singapore government. The Belt\nand Road Initiative was dangled as bait and the possibility of being excluded loomed\nas a threat, even though Singapore, as a highly developed country, did not need BRI\ninfrastructure. Communist Party chairman Xi Jinping himself had asked Singapore\nto start a BRI-related project in Chongqing. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was\npointedly not invited to the BRI Summit held in Beijing in 2017, although Singapore\nwas represented at a lower level. Appeals to ethnic pride were made to yet others.\nThe operation was effective. The pressures on the government were great. It was\ndifficult to explain the nuances of the SCS issue or Singapore’s relations with China to\nthe general public.\nThen Beijing went too far. In November 2016, nine Singapore armored personnel\ncarriers (APCs) en route home from an overseas military exercise were seized by China\non the flimsiest of excuses. 2 Singaporeans immediately understood that this was naked\nintimidation. Even the leader of the opposition Workers’ Party criticized China in\nParliament. Beijing, by then increasingly concerned with the Trump administration,\ndecided to settle. In January 2017, the APCs were released. The influence apparatus\ngradually stood down and relations returned to normal. Chinese leaders went out of\ntheir way to project friendliness. In late 2017, when news of Prime Minister Lee Hsien\nLoong being invited to the White House by President Trump became public, the prime\nminister was hastily invited to come to Beijing first, where he was received by Xi and\nother senior Chinese leaders.\nAcademia\nMost of the means by which the Chinese narratives were spread in 2016–17 were not\nillegal. However, in August 2017, Huang Jing, an academic born in China who was\nAppendix 2\n177\nteaching at the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy\n(LKYSPP), was expelled from Singapore and permanently banned from the country.\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs (responsible for internal security and counterespionage)\nsaid in a statement announcing the expulsion that Huang had been “identified as\nan agent of influence of a foreign country” who had “knowingly interacted with\nintelligence organizations and agents of the foreign country and cooperated with\nthem to influence the Singapore Government’s foreign policy and public opinion in\nSingapore. To this end, he engaged prominent and influential Singaporeans and gave\nthem what he claimed was ‘privileged information’ about the foreign country so as to\ninfluence their opinions in favor of that country. Huang also recruited others in aid of\nhis operations.” 3 The statement went on to say that Huang gave supposedly “privileged\ninformation” to a senior member of the school of public policy in order that it be\nconveyed to the Singapore government. The information was duly conveyed to very\nsenior public officials who were in a position to direct Singapore’s foreign policy.\nThe intention, the statement said, was to use the information to cause the Singapore\ngovernment to change its foreign policy. The statement concluded that Huang Jing’s\ncollaboration with foreign intelligence agents was “subversion and foreign interference\nin Singapore’s domestic politics.”\nThe Singapore government has not named the foreign country. In 1988, Singapore had\nexpelled an American diplomat for interference in domestic politics. But it is generally\naccepted that Singapore’s moves in Huang Jing’s case were directed at China.\nImplications for ASEAN\nThere has been no systematic study of Chinese influence operations in ASEAN member\nstates. As a major economy contiguous to Southeast Asia, China will always naturally\nenjoy significant influence even in the absence of such operations. However, anecdotal\nevidence suggests that Singapore’s experience is generally consistent across the region.\nThe differences stem mainly from lax governance standards in other ASEAN member\nstates and their lower level of development. Economic inducements and the greater\ndependence of these countries on Chinese investment, under the general rubric of the\nBelt and Road Initiative, seem to play a more prominent role.\nA common factor is the focus on overseas Chinese communities. Such operations are\nleading China into sensitive territory in Southeast Asia, where the overseas Chinese are\nnot always welcome minorities. China’s navigation of these complexities has in many\ncases been clumsy. Malaysia provides a particularly egregious example that betrays a\nform of cultural and political autism. During the 2018 Malaysian general elections, the\nChinese ambassador to Malaysia openly campaigned for the president of the Malaysian\nChinese Association (MCA) in his constituency. This was a blatant violation of the\nAppendix 2\n178\nprinciple of noninterference enshrined in Article 41 of the Vienna Convention on\nDiplomatic Relations. It exposed beyond the possibility of concealment what China\nreally thinks of noninterference. The MCA president lost his seat.\nThis was not the only instance of insensitive behavior by Chinese diplomats in\nMalaysia. In 2015, the previous Chinese ambassador saw fit to make his way to\nKuala Lumpur’s Chinatown, where only days previously the police had to use water\ncannons to disperse a potentially violent anti-Chinese demonstration. There the\nChinese ambassador delivered a speech that, among other things, pronounced\nthe Chinese government’s opposition to any form of racial discrimination, adding\nfor good measure that it would be a shame if the peace of the area were to be\ndisrupted by the ill-intentioned and that Beijing would not stand idly by if anything\nthreatened the interests of its citizens and Malaysia-China relations.\nUnder other circumstances, these sentiments would perhaps have passed unnoticed.\nBut the timing and context laid the ambassador’s remarks open to disquieting\ninterpretations and drew a protest from the Malaysian government. The PRC foreign\nministry spokesman defended the ambassador’s action as “normal, friendly behavior.”\nUndaunted, in another speech a day later, the Chinese ambassador said, “I would like\nto stress once more, overseas huaqiao and huaren, no matter where you go, no matter\nhow many generations you are, China is forever your warm national home.” 4\nSuch behavior is not atypical in Southeast Asia. If other Chinese diplomats have\nbehaved more prudently in their engagement of overseas Chinese communities in\nother ASEAN countries, it seems a matter of differences between individuals rather\nthan policy. Since such behavior is patently not in China’s interest, China may be\nbeginning to believe its own propaganda. President Xi’s concentration of power and\ninsistence on greater party control seem to have created echo chambers where Chinese\ndiplomats and officials probably report only what is in accordance with preexisting\nbeliefs, resulting in situations where instructions are blindly given and followed.\nThis kind of behavior is not confined to countries where there are large overseas Chinese\ncommunities. Cultural autism or insensitivity is one of the self-created obstacles to the\nsmooth implementation of the BRI that China is experiencing around the world. And as\nthe media report on the problems, awareness spreads. This does not mean that countries\nwill shun working with China. But countries are going to be increasingly cautious. They\nwill push back when the terms of engagement are too onerous and they will seek to forge\nrelationships with as many other major powers as possible.\nFollowing the Malaysian elections, China is projecting friendliness toward Malaysia. But\nas with Singapore, this is a pause, not the end of the story. Since influence operations are\nAppendix 2\n179\nembedded in the intrinsic nature of the Chinese state, they cannot be abandoned unless\nthe nature of the Chinese state fundamentally changes. This is very unlikely.\nNOTES\n1 ​“Singapore Government Statement,” Government of Singapore, May 15, 1971, http://www​. nas​. gov​. sg​\n/ archivesonline​/ data​/ pdfdoc​/ SGPress​_ 3​_ 15​. 5​. 71​. pdf.\n2 ​Jermyn Chow, “SAF Armoured Vehicles Seized in Hong Kong Port, Mindef Expects Shipment to Return\nto Singapore ‘Expeditiously,’ ” Straits Times (Singapore), November 24, 2016, accessed October 11, 2018,\nhttps:// www​. straitstimes​. com​/ asia​/ se​- asia​/ 9​- saf​- armoured​- vehicles​- seized​- at​- hong​- kong​- port.\n3 ​“Cancellation of Singapore Permanent Residence (SPR) Status—Huang Jing and Yang Xiuping,”\nSingapore Ministry of Home Affairs, August 6, 2017, accessed October 11, 2018, https:// www​. mha​. gov​. sg​\n/ newsroom​/ press​- release​/ news​/ cancellation​- of​- singapore​- permanent​- residence​-(spr)​- status—huang​- jing​\n- and​- yang​- xiuping.\n4 ​Shannon Teoh and Eunice Au, “KL Wants Chinese Envoy to Explain Remarks,” Straits Times (Singapore),\nOctober 2, 2015, accessed October 11, 2018, https://www​.straitstimes​.com​/asia​/se​-asia​/kl​-wants​-chinese​\n-envoy​-to​-explain​-remarks.\nUNITED KINGDOM\nUnlike the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, the United Kingdom has had\nno significant all-encompassing debate over Chinese influence operations. When\nthey have occurred, the debates tend to be confined to specific areas such as the\nmedia, academia, or the economy. But so far, no one institute has attempted to bring\nto light the full gamut of Chinese United Front and influence-peddling operations. As\nsuch, Britain’s response to China’s attempts to insinuate itself within Britain’s critical\ninfrastructure, universities, civil society, political system, and think tanks has been\nscattershot at best.\nThe United Kingdom has a complex political, economic, and historical relationship\nwith China, which is a significant trading partner and an increasingly significant\nsource of investment. 1 Especially since the official elevation of UK-China relations to\nGolden Era status in 2014 and the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum, the United\nKingdom has become more open to Chinese influence. 2 Areas of vulnerability\nto improper interference include political and civil society actors as well as the\nmedia. Chinese firms are involved in strategic parts of the British economy, including\ntelecommunications and nuclear power. Improper interference activities can be difficult\nto distinguish from acceptable influence via civil society exchange, public diplomacy,\nand commerce. Problem cases include not only Chinese cyberattacks on political\norganizations and think tanks but also willing collaboration and reluctant complicity.\nA report by GPPi and Merics characterized the most important areas for Chinese\nAppendix 2\n180\ninfluence operations as civil society and the media. 3 But others have noted that\nChina’s leverage over the UK economy is equally, if not more, important.\nPolitics\nSince 2012, the UK governments under prime ministers David Cameron and Theresa\nMay have progressively toned down criticism of China over human rights and Beijing’s\nobligations toward the United Kingdom to respect the Sino-British agreement on Hong\nKong. While this may be in part due to the United Kingdom’s relatively weakening\nposition, these changes have coincided with Chinese efforts to influence British foreign\npolicy.\nInfluence activities by China have included not only apparent attempts to engage\nin cyberattacks on the Scottish Parliament and on think tanks specializing\nin international security issues with connections to government but also reports\nof intimidating messages sent to politicians seen as enemies of China. 4 China has\nalso denied UK politicians, such as members of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs\nCommittee and the deputy chair of the Conservative Party’s Human Rights Commission,\nBen Rogers, access to Hong Kong to investigate human rights issues there. 5\nChina has also acquired influence by offering jobs to former politicians, potentially creating\ndependencies. Former prime minister David Cameron is a case in point. Cameron\ndistanced himself from the Dalai Lama in 2013 and embraced a Golden Era of\nUK-China ties in 2015 while still in office, positioning himself as China’s best friend in\nEurope. 6 Once out of office, Cameron accepted a senior role in the UK-China Fund, a\nmajor infrastructure fund connected with China’s Belt and Road Initiative. 7\nAcademia and Civil Society\nThe Chinese government can exercise influence in the United Kingdom through a\nnumber of mechanisms: repression in China that affects China-related work, such\nas the new Foreign NGO Management Law; remote cybermonitoring; the creation of\nnew institutions it controls; collaborations based on Chinese funding, with strings\nattached; control of Chinese nationals in the United Kingdom; and reporting on or\npressuring domestic institutions and individuals in the United Kingdom. The targets of\nsuch influence activities include the communities these actors serve: students, clients,\nand the wider public.\nChinese scholars and students in the United Kingdom (as of March 2018, some\n170,000) register with the Chinese Students and Scholars Association UK, which\norganizes political education events and is supposed to monitor its members in\naccordance with its “patriotic” mission. 8 Reportedly, students at some universities in\nAppendix 2\n181\nthe United Kingdom have also established Chinese Communist Party cells. 9 The use of\nthe CSSA UK to monitor dissent among Chinese students in the United Kingdom is a\ndirect violation of the principles of the United Kingdom’s democracy.\nInstitutions created or managed by the Chinese authorities include the country’s\ntwenty-nine Hanban-managed Confucius Institutes as well as the new Peking\nUniversity HSBC Business School Oxford Campus—the first overseas campus of a\nChinese university. These institutions have triggered some concerns. They openly\ndiscriminate against certain groups, such as Falun Gong practitioners who are excluded\nfrom employment, as North American cases have shown. 10 Reportedly, agreements\nwith universities that host Confucius Institutes require adherence to Chinese law\naccording to Hanban policies and they are subject to nondisclosure agreements. 11 The\nconcern that these institutions practice (self-)censorship is somewhat mitigated as long\nas the authorship of censored accounts is clear and robust and critical discussion takes\nplace elsewhere in the United Kingdom.\nActivities benefitting from Chinese funding or commercial ties with China are all\nthe more concerning when Chinese influence is less easy to trace. It is impossible\nto tell, for example, if Huawei’s donation to Chatham House’s Asia-Pacific program\nwill affect this venerable institution’s independence and if UK universities’ selfcensorship\non their Chinese campuses will bleed into their home bases. 12 It is clear,\non the other hand, that funding provided to research students and researchers who\ncome to the United Kingdom from China leads to self-censorship. The increased\nrole of the China Scholarship Council, a PRC-funded grant provider, is therefore\nof great concern, as it clearly would not approve projects that might anger China’s\ngovernment. 13 UK-based publishing in China gives rise to concerns about censorship,\nas in the case of Cambridge University Press temporarily censoring the online version\nof its journal China Quarterly in China to accommodate government censorship\nrequests. 14\nChina’s treatment of UK-funded educational institutions in China is also of concern\nin Britain. In June 2018, the University of Nottingham’s campus in Ningbo removed\nits associate provost, Stephen Morgan, after he wrote an online piece criticizing the\nresults of China’s Nineteenth Party Congress. 15 Nottingham has previously given the\nappearance of buckling to Chinese pressure. In 2016, Nottingham abruptly shut its\nSchool of Contemporary Chinese Studies just as students were preparing for exams. The\naction led to the departure of its director, Steve Tsang, a China scholar known for his\nintegrity and independence from Beijing. Sources close to the incident said that PRC\npressure on the university played a direct role in the closure of the institute. Tsang is\nnow the director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and Africa Studies at\nthe University of London.\nAppendix 2\n182\nMedia\nThe UK media have long been important international sources of information and\ninsight on China, reporting independently and critically. While independent reporting\ncontinues, Chinese official media have become more influential in the United Kingdom\nand internationally through their UK presence. Primarily, they have expanded their\noperations and reach. For example, the re-branded China Global Television Network\nEurope Ltd (CGTN), headquartered in London, is seeking to increase activities and\nChina Daily now distributes its China Watch “supplement” as an advertisement inside\nthe respected conservative newspaper the Daily Telegraph. The UK and Chinese\ngovernments have also concluded a Television Co-Production Agreement that provides\na framework under which TV producers in both countries can share resources but have\nto respect “stipulations in the relevant Party’s law and regulations.” 16\nGiven the United Kingdom’s special historical relationship with Hong Kong, the\ncentral authorities’ heavy influence on the Hong Kong media and the deterioration of\nmedia freedom in Hong Kong are of relevance in the United Kingdom, where the case\nof rising self-censorship at the South China Morning Post, for example, has been noted. 17\nAccording to confidential reports, some journalists who have left Hong Kong for the\nUnited Kingdom have encountered intimidation attempts.\nThe effects of media-influencing activities taking place in the United Kingdom are\nhard to assess. Critical reporting continues, but the rise of commercial ventures\ntransporting censorship into the United Kingdom looks set to continue too. For the\nmoment, increasingly difficult access to information and insight in China, as a result\nof domestic repression, is at least as great a problem as attempts to influence or repress\nremotely in the United Kingdom.\nThe Economy\nFor years, the United Kingdom was a bit of an outlier in its openness to Chinese\ninvestment and its willingness to grant Chinese firms, even state-owned ones, access to\nits critical infrastructure. Nonetheless, there is now growing concern in London about\nChina’s ability to leverage its growing economic power into political influence and to\nuse its riches to buy, borrow, or steal key Western technologies that sit at the heart of\nWestern economies.\nIn partnership with France and Germany, the UK government has also introduced\nmechanisms to monitor and block Chinese takeovers of high-technology companies in\nsensitive sectors. 18 The three nations also support efforts to tighten EU-wide regulations\nto govern Chinese investment so that Chinese entities cannot exploit the weaker\nregulatory systems of some European countries to gain access to potentially sensitive\nAppendix 2\n183\ntechnologies. It is unclear how the United Kingdom’s Brexit plan will affect the stated\ndesire of the UK government to ensure that critical technologies do not fall into Chinese\nhands.\nFor years, the Chinese telecom behemoth Huawei has provided broadband gear and\nmobile networks to its clients in Britain, which include British Telecom and Vodafone.\nAnd for years, Huawei executives used their substantial business opportunities in\nBritain as an example to counter allegations in the United States and other Western\ncountries that Huawei was linked to the People’s Liberation Army and therefore a\nsecurity risk. Now it seems that Britain’s government is having second thoughts.\nA government report issued in July 2018 noted that technical and supply-chain\nissues with equipment made by Huawei have exposed Britain’s telecom networks\nto new security risks. 19 Earlier in 2018, Britain’s cybersecurity watchdog warned\ntelecommunications companies against dealing with the Chinese manufacturer\nZTE, citing “potential risks” to national security. 20 ZTE was involved in widespread\nsanctions-busting in deals with Iran and North Korea.\nAnother area of growing concern is nuclear power. China General Nuclear Power\n(GNP)—the main player in China’s nuclear industry—is considering the purchase of a\n49 percent stake in the United Kingdom’s existing nuclear plants. 21 The nuclear power\ngiant has already taken a 33.5 percent stake in the Hinkley Point C power station,\nwhich is being built with French technology. China experts in the United Kingdom\nsuch as Isabel Hilton, the CEO of Chinadialogue​. net, have observed that in opening\nup its vital infrastructure to China, the United Kingdom was without parallel in the\nWestern world. “No other OECD country has done this. This is strategic infrastructure,\nand China is a partner but not an ally in the security sense. . . . ​You are making a 50-year\nbet, not only that there will be no dispute between the UK and China but also no\ndispute between China and one of the UK’s allies. It makes no strategic sense.” 22\nResponses to Interference Activities\nIn addition to some limited pushback on Chinese economic moves, there are signs\nthat the United Kingdom is slowly understanding the challenge presented by Chinese\ninfluence activities. UK media have continued to report pressure on journalists, the\nmedia, civil society, and those involved in politics. This reporting has been somewhat\neffective in correcting perceptions of the nature and functioning of Chinese governance.\nThe media have also focused attention on how China monitors and obstructs the work\nof foreign reporters in China.\nThe political system has also begun to respond to some influence activities. At the\ndomestic level, a parliamentary inquiry on the United Kingdom’s relations with China,\nAppendix 2\n184\nlaunched in 2015 and relaunched in 2017, has sought input on some of the issues\ndiscussed here. 23 A newly launched NGO, Hong Kong Watch, focuses on drawing\nattention to the United Kingdom’s special responsibility toward Hong Kong. The\nConservative Party Human Rights Commission has produced its own report on the\ndeteriorating human rights situation in both China and Hong Kong and has organized\ninquiries and events on topics such as the United Kingdom’s Confucius Institutes. 24\nWhile the Foreign and Commonwealth Office presents the relationship with China\nas primarily collaborative, it is also conducting research on Chinese influence and\ninterference activities. 25 At the international level, the United Kingdom has joined\nseveral open letters to signal its position on China’s violations of human rights. 26\nCivil society has also sought to raise the Foreign NGO Management Law as well as\nto highlight intensified repression. By contrast, responses from academic institutions\nhave so far been sporadic. For example, in 2011, the University of Cambridge\ndisaffiliated CSSA Cambridge due to its undemocratic organization. 27 In 2017,\ninternational academics joined together to convince the Cambridge University Press\nto stop censoring its publications available in China. 28 Still, despite experiencing such\ninfluence campaigns in the past, such as with Libya, which was spelled out in the\n2011 Woolf Inquiry, there seems to have been no coherent initiative on protecting\nacademic freedom and maintaining wider ethical standards in the face of these types\nof campaigns. 29\nNOTES\n1 ​$9.6 billion in the United Kingdom according to Godement and Vasselier, “China at the Gates.”\n2 ​“New Phase in Golden Era for UK-China Relations,” Government of the United Kingdom, December 15,\n2017, accessed October 11, 2018, https://www​.gov​.uk​/government​/news​/new​-phase​-in​-golden​-era​-for​-uk​\n- china​- relations.\n3 ​Benner et al., “Authoritarian Advance.”\n4 ​Paul Hutcheon, “China Accused of Being Behind Recent Cyber Attack on Scottish Parliament,” Herald\n(Scotland), September 16, 2017, accessed October 11, 2018, http://www​.heraldscotland​.com​/news​\n/15540166​.China​_accused​_of​_being​_behind​_recent​_cyber​_attack​_on​_Scottish​_Parliament;

CCTV channels (English and Chinese) are in the cable systems of\nall the major metropolitan areas of the United States.\n• The major official Chinese TV networks, including CCTV and major Chinese\nprovincial TV networks, and the quasi-official Phoenix TV, are all in the\nprogram lineups of Chinese TV streaming services that have become popular\namong Chinese communities in the United States. There are four major Chinese\nstreaming services in the United States: iTalkBB Chinese TV ( 蜻蜓電視 ), Charming\nChina ( 魅力中國 ), Great Wall ( 長城平台 ), and KyLin TV ( 麒麟電視 ). All these services\ncarry the major official Chinese TV channels, including major provincial\nchannels, and are accessible nationwide.\n• The major official Chinese media organizations, CCTV (CGTN), Xinhua, the\nPeople’s Daily, and China Daily (the only major official newspaper in English),\nhave a heavy presence on all major social media platforms of the United States\nand have many followers. All these outlets use Facebook and Twitter and other\nplatforms, even though those platforms are blocked in China.\n• Quasi-official Phoenix TV ( 鳳凰衛視 ), a global TV network with links to the PRC’s\nMinistry of State Security and headquartered in Hong Kong with branches around\nthe world, including the United States, also has a substantial presence on all the\nmajor social media platforms in the United States.\n188\nChinese media social media presence\n(E) = English version; (C) = Chinese version\nPlatform Official Organizations and Subscribers/Followers Quasi-official\nCCTV (CGTN) Xinhua People’s\nDaily\nChina\nDaily\nTwitter CCTV: 532K (E+C) 11.8M (E) 4.54M (E) 1.8M (E) 7K (C)\nCGTN: 7.19M (E) 11.6M (C) 221K (C)\nFacebook CCTV: 48.04M (E);\n46.92M (E) 43.15M (E) 35.17M (E) 14K (C)\n3.44M (C)\n171K (C)\nCGTN: 58.28M (E)\nCGTN America: 1.2M (E)\nYouTube 289K (C) 173K (E) 25K (E) 3K (E) 75K (C)\nInstagram 550K (E) 111K (E) 696K (E) 23.5K (E) N/A\nPhoenix TV (fully\ncontrolled by Chinese\ngovernment)\nPRC-Funded and PRC-Controlled Media Outlets\nThe Chinese Communist Party liaises with Chinese-language media mainly through\nthe Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council (or Qiao Ban 侨办 ). The Qiao\nBan holds an annual conference on Chinese-language media called the World Chinese\nMedia Forum. These media outlets are registered in the United States by US citizens\nor permanent residents, but they might actually be owned by Chinese state-run\ncompanies.\nThe Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council of PRC ( 中國國務院僑務辦公室 )\nappears to directly control the Asian Culture and Media Group ( 美國亞洲文化傳媒集團 )\nin America, which has three media subsidiaries: SinoVision ( 美國中文電視 ), the China\nPress (Qiaobao or 僑報 ), and the Sino American Times ( 美洲时报 ). Sky Link TV ( 天下衛視 )\nis another media outlet in the United States. Unlike SinoVision and Qiaobao, it is fully\nowned by Guangzhou Media American Co, Ltd. ( 美國廣視傳媒有限公司 ), which in turn\nis owned by GZ Television Media ( 广州影视传媒有限公司 ), a Chinese state-owned media\noutlet.\nSinoVision\nThe group’s main TV outlet is SinoVision. It operates two twenty-four-hour channels\n(one Chinese and one English), and it is on the program lineups of cable systems Time\nWarner Cable-73, Verizon FiOS-26, Cablevision-73, and RCN-80, covering about thirty\nmillion people. Sinovision’s website ( 美国中文电视 , ht t p : //w w w​.s i n o v i s i o n ​.n e t ) r a n k s\nAppendix 3\n189\ntwelfth among all the Chinese websites in the United States. Its reporting hews closely\nto China’s official media:\n• Example 1: On June 27, 2017, the US Department of State, in its annual Trafficking\nin Persons Report 2017, put China at Tier 3, the lowest class. In reporting this\nnews, SinovisionNet simply reposted comments from the official website of the\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs of China attacking the human rights record of the\nUnited States. 1\n• Example 2: In March 2017, the US State Department published its 2016 Human\nRights Report. SinovisionNet published two stories on this topic. One reported\nthe reaction to the story by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The other story\ncame from Xinhua, which was highly critical of the US human rights situation.\nSinovisionNet also published two reports by the Information Office of the State\nCouncil of China on America’s human rights record. It did not publish State\nDepartment’s human rights report. 2\n• Example 3: On the tensions in the South China Sea, almost all the stories posted\non SinovisionNet are from official Chinese media outlets and websites. They are\nnaturally critical of US actions in that area. 3\nQiaobao and the Sino American Times\nQiaobao, or the China Press ( 僑報 , http:// www​. uschinapress​. com), is the flagship\npro-PRC newspaper published in the United States. Its website ranks forty-first among\nall the Chinese websites in the United States. Qiaobao was established in 1990. It is\nheadquartered in New York City with branches in twelve major metropolitan areas of\nthe United States. The Sino American Times ( 美洲时报 ) is a free paper and not a major\nmedia presence in the United States.\nIndependent Media\nOver the course of the last decade, most of the independent Chinese-language media\noutlets in the United States have been taken over by businessmen sympathetic to the\nPRC.\n• Wenxuecheng ( 文学城 , wenxuecheng​. com) is the most popular Chinese-language\nwebsite in the United States. In 2003, it was purchased by a Taiwanese American\nAppendix 3\n190\nbusinessman with business interests in China. There is an unsubstantiated\nrumor that the investment was subsidized by $1 million from the Ministry of\nPropaganda.\n• Duowei is another online source that was for years an independent Chineselanguage\nmedia. It was purchased in 2009 by a pro-PRC Hong Kong businessman.\n• Mingjing, or Mirror Media, a Chinese-language web presence based in Canada,\nwas once considered independent of Beijing’s control but has modified its\nreporting in recent years.\n• Backchina​. com, ( 倍可亲 , ranked as the fifth most popular Chinese website in\nthe United States), was once a staunch critic of China like Duowei. But in 2017\nits editors attended the ninth World Chinese Media Forum in China and its\nreporting became far more positive about the PRC.\n• Sing Tao Newspaper Group was established in Hong Kong in 1938. In 2001, it\nwas purchased by a pro-Beijing businessman.\n• The World Journal ( 世界日报 ) was for years the premier Chinese-language paper in\nthe United States. It, too, has softened its stance on the PRC in recent years.\n• Ming Pao served the Hong Kong-immigrant community. It is another formerly\nindependent newspaper that has fallen under Beijing’s control.\n• Boxun is a Chinese-language news site whose servers are located in North\nCarolina. It was founded by an immigrant from China. Its news is highly\nunreliable.\n• The Epoch Times ( 大纪元 ), the Hope Radio, and New Tang Dynasty TV, remain\nindependent of PRC control. They are either owned or operated by adherents\nto the Falun Gong sect, which is banned in China. Their reporting on China\nis uneven.\n• Vision Times (secretchina​. com) was founded in 2001 as a website, secretchina​\n. com, and began publishing a free weekly newspaper in 2005.\nAppendix 3\n191\nNOTES\n1 ​“ 美国务院欲将中国人权状况调为最差等级外交部回应 .” Sinovision.

The\nreport discusses a very broad range of Chinese activities, only some of which constitute\ncoercive, covert, or corrupt interference in American society and none of which actually\nundermines our democratic political institutions. Not distinguishing the legitimate from\nthe illegitimate activities detracts from the credibility of the report. The cumulative effect\nof this expansive inventory that blurs together legitimate with illegitimate activities is to\noverstate the threat that China today poses to the American way of life. Especially during\nthis moment in American political history, overstating the threat of subversion from\nChina risks causing overreactions reminiscent of the Cold War with the Soviet Union,\nincluding an anti-Chinese version of the Red Scare that would put all ethnic Chinese under\na cloud of suspicion. Right now, I believe the harm we could cause our society by our own\noverreactions actually is greater than that caused by Chinese influence seeking. That is why\nI feel I must dissent from the overall threat assessment of the report.\n194\nDissenting Opinion\nAfterword\nORVILLE SCHELL AND LARRY DIAMOND\nWhat makes this report timely and important is China’s increasingly forward and aggressive\nposture on the global stage. Once largely a form of economic competition, China’s recent\nturn to military and political rivalry with the United States has changed the whole\nequation of the bilateral relationship. If the United States is to fare well in this increasingly\nadversarial competition, Americans must have a far better sense than they now do about\nboth the nature of the system and values that underlay the People’s Republic of China and\nthe challenges Beijing’s ambitious agenda of multi-faceted outreach is beginning to pose\nfor our country—especially our media, universities, think tanks, and other civil society\ninstitutions that make our society so unique, vibrant, and strong.\nHowever, at the same time that we fortify ourselves against harmful outside interference,\nwe must also be mindful to do no harm. In particular, we must guard against having this\nreport used unfairly to cast aspersions on Chinese, whether Chinese American immigrants\nwho have become (or are becoming) United States citizens, Chinese students, Chinese\nbusinesspeople, or other kinds of Chinese visitors, whose contributions to America’s\nprogress over the past century have been enormous.\nJust because the Chinese Communist Party presumes that all ethnic Chinese (wherever\nthey may reside) still owe some measure of loyalty “to the Chinese motherland,” zuguo\n( 祖国 ), does not mean that they are collectively in possession of compromised loyalty to\ntheir adopted home or place of study. Our Working Group’s findings do suggest that the\nleadership of the PRC has stepped up a new and well funded campaign of influence seeking\nin the United States. However, this should not be viewed as an invitation to a McCarthy eralike\nreaction against Chinese in America. Rather, it is a summons to greater awareness of the\nchallenges our country faces and greater vigilance in defending our institutions.\nIn helping to convene this Working Group on Chinese influence seeking in the United\nStates (and elsewhere in the world), the intention of the Task Force on US-China relations\nhas been to limit the growing PRC challenge to American institutions and values, which\nis being played according to rules that are increasingly lacking in reciprocity. Developing\nstrategies to counteract and protect our society when influence seeking becomes\ninterference is the charge of this report, and perhaps the most effective defense is to\nstrengthen our own democratic values and institutions. But at the same time we would be\nnaïve not to want to become more familiar with the full dimensions of Beijing’s overseas\nambitions, the state organs, and the resources now dedicated to “overseas propaganda,”\n196\nwaixuan ( 外宣 ), and the less than transparent manner in which Chinese influence seeking is\noften carried out.\nWe reiterate: it is absolutely crucial that whatever measures are taken to counteract harmful\nforms of Chinese influence seeking not end up demonizing any group of Americans, or\neven visitors to America, in ways that are unfair or reckless.\nAfterword\nAbout the Participants\nRobert Daly is Director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States at the\nWoodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\nLarry Diamond is Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and at the Freeman Spogli\nInstitute for International Studies at Stanford University.\nElizabeth Economy is the C.V.

Intelligence evolved because it allowed us to make sense of the\nworld around us, to plan ahead, and thus cope with all sorts of unexpected things in order\nto survive. However, as Descartes stated, we humans define our very existence by our\nability to think. So it is not surprising that, in an anthropomorphic way, our fears about\nAI reflect this belief that our intelligence is what makes us special.\n\nBut if we step back and look at life on Earth, we see that we are far from the most\nresilient species. If we’re going to be taken over at some point, it will be by some of\nEarth’s oldest life-forms, like bacteria, which can live anywhere from Antarctica to deep-\nsea thermal vents hotter than boiling water, or in acid environments that would melt you\nand me. So when people ask where we’re headed, we need to put the question in a\nbroader context.

The majority,\nwritten by Justice Anthony Kennedy,\nheld that DOMA is unconstitutional as\na deprivation of the liberty of the person\nprotected by the Fifth Amendment of the\nConstitution.\nThe decision opens the door for same-sex\nmarried couples to enjoy many federal taxrelated\nbenefits previously available only to\nopposite-sex married couples. These include\nincome tax benefits, estate and gift tax benefits,\ntaxpayer-friendly employee benefits,\nand more. Same-sex couples must now also\ndeal with circumstances under the tax law\nthat may create a so-called “marriage penalty.”\nEmployers must prepare for extensive\nchanges in the treatment of same-sex\ncouples. And individuals claiming tax credits\nand other provisions under the Patient\nProtection and Affordable Care Act are impacted\nby the decision.\nIMPACT. It is unclear how quickly the\nIRS and other federal agencies will react\nto the Supreme Court’s decision …or\nhow quickly same-sex couples may need\nto act to protect certain rights. President\nObama has directed all federal\nagencies, including Treasury and the\nIRS, to revise their regulations to reflect\nthe Supreme Court’s decision as soon as\npossible. Many tax professionals had\nbeen advising same-sex couples to file\nprotective refund claims in anticipation\nof a favorable ruling from the Supreme\nCourt. This is one of several strategies\nthat practitioners and taxpayers should\nfollow up on, as well as filing amended\nreturns before the applicable limitations\nperiods expire on back tax years. The\ndecision to strike down DOMA goes beyond\nrefunds. Same-sex couples need to\nconsider many other tax implications.\nIMPACT. The Supreme Court did not extend\nsame-sex marriage nationwide; it declined\nto say whether same-sex couples had\na Constitutional right to marriage that\nwould override state law. But the Supreme\nCourt’s decision has opened up federal\nbenefits –including those under the Internal\nRevenue Code-- to same-sex couples\nconsidered married under state law. The\nWindsor decision leaves many additional\nissues unresolved or unclear. Among them\nare the status of “domestic partnerships”\nand “civil unions” under state law in connection\nwith federal benefits, the status of\na same-sex couple married in one state but\nnow residing in a state in which same-sex\nmarriage is not recognized, and the ability\nof married same-sex couples to divorce\nwithout first moving back to a state that\nrecognizes same-sex marriage.\nCAUTION. Immediately after the Windsor\ndecision was released, questions arose\nregarding the impact of residency upon the\nrecognition of marital status for federal tax\npurposes. Will same-sex couples duly married\nin one state who now reside in a state\nthat does not recognize same-sex marriage\nbe entitled to federal benefits, including\nbeing able to file jointly under the federal\ntax laws? …Or will they be required to file\nas single under federal law as well as state\nlaw? While President Obama on June\n27 expressed the view that same-sex marriages\nperformed in one state should apply\n2\n2013 Expert Analysis\nto another, he added that “I’m speaking as a\npresident and not as a lawyer.”\nISSUES AT STAKE\nIn December 2012, the Supreme Court announced\nthat it would take up two cases related\nto same-sex couples: Windsor, which\narose out of an estate tax dispute between a\nsurviving partner/spouse and the IRS; and\nHollingsworth v. Perry (CA-9, Feb. 7, 2012),\nwhich addressed whether the equal protection\nclause of the Fourteenth Amendment to\nthe Constitution prohibits California from\ndefining marriage as the union of a man and\nwoman. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments\nin both cases in March 2013.\nIRS Denies Estate Tax Marital Deduction.\nIn Windsor, a long-time same-sex couple\nmarried in Canada in 2007. They had previously\nregistered as domestic partners in New\nYork City, where they made their home. One\nspouse died in 2009. Because of DOMA, the\nsurvivor did not qualify for the unlimited\nmarital deduction under the Internal Revenue\nCode and as a result, the executor of the estate\npaid $363,000 in federal estate tax that was\nnot otherwise due. The survivor as executor\nand sole beneficiary filed a refund claim under\nCode Sec. 2056(a) (under which property of\na surviving spouse generally passes free of federal\nestate tax). The IRS determined that the\nsurvivor was not a spouse under Section 3 of\nDOMA and, therefore, not a surviving spouse\nunder Code Sec. 2056(a). A federal district\ncourt found that Section 3 of DOMA violated\nthe equal protection clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment because there was no rational\nbasis to support it. The Second Circuit Court\nof Appeals affirmed the lower’s court decision,\nfinding that homosexuals are a protected class\nand that Section 3 of DOMA was not substantially\nrelated to an important government\ninterest and violated Equal Protection.\nSUPREME COURT’S\nHOLDINGS\nWriting for the majority in Windsor, Justice\nKennedy found that DOMA had departed\nfrom the long standing tradition and history\nof reliance on state law to define marriage.\nThe State of New York had recognized\nthe validity of same-sex marriages, which\nresulted in a status that “is a far-reaching\nlegal acknowledgment of the intimate relationship\nbetween two people, a relationship\ndeemed by the State worthy of dignity in the\ncommunity equal with all other marriages,”\nKennedy wrote. He reasoned that DOMA\nsought to injure this class of persons whom\nNew York sought to protect, and by doing so\nviolated basic due process and equal protection\nprinciples applicable to the federal government\nand was therefore unconstitutional.\n“The decision opens the\ndoor for same-sex couples\nto enjoy many tax-related\nbenefits previously\navailable only to oppositesex\ncouples.”\nDOMA’s operation in practice, Kennedy\ncontinued, was to treat same-sex marriages as\nsecond-class marriages for purposes of federal\nlaw “by imposing a system-wide enactment\nwith no identified connection to any particular\narea of federal law.” DOMA’s principal\npurpose was to impose inequality, not for\nother reasons such as governmental efficiency,\nKennedy held. Therefore, the majority\nfound DOMA invalid for lack of a legitimate\ngovernment purpose that could overcome\nthe burden on those within the class whose\npersonhood and dignity New York had\nsought to protect through its marriage laws.\nCOMMENT: The majority opinion\nlisted numerous ways in which DOMA\ninfringed upon the dignity of same-sex\ncouples. Among these is financial harm\ncaused by DOMA to children of same-sex\ncouples by raising the cost of health care\nfor families by taxing health benefits provided\nby employers to their workers’ samesex\nspouses. Another example, Kennedy\nwrote, is that DOMA denies or reduces\nbenefits allowed to families upon the loss\nof a spouse and parent, benefits that are\nan integral part of family security.\nCOMMENT: Justice Kennedy qualified\nthe majority’s ruling at the end of the decision,\nstating that its applicability was\n“confined to those lawful marriages,”\nmeaning those recognized by the states\nthat currently allow same-sex marriages.\nKennedy observed that Section 2 of\nDOMA, which allows States to refuse to\nrecognize same-sex marriages performed\nunder the laws of other States, had not\nbeen challenged in Windsor and continues\nto be the law. On June 26, House\nDemocrats introduced legislation to repeal\nSection 2 of DOMA.\nCalifornia’s Proposition 8. On the same day\nthe Supreme Court announced its decision in\nWindsor, the Justices ruled, 5-4 (but with a different\nmix of Justices for and against), to send\nHollingsworth back to the California courts\nrather than to directly decide on the constitutionality\nof California’s ban on same-sex marriage.\nThere, the Supreme Court held that the\npetitioners did not have the standing to challenge\nthe lower court’s decision throwing out\nProposition 8, which denied same-sex couples\nthe right to marry in California. This decision\npaves the way for same-sex marriage to begin\nagain in California sometime in late July.\nFEDERAL TAX\nCONSEQUENCES\nUnder federal income tax rules, same-sex\nmarried couples can now presumably enjoy\nbenefits that had been unavailable to them\nbecause of DOMA. On the other hand, certain\nstrategic advantages previously enjoyed\nby same-sex married couples who filed as\nsingle individuals under the federal tax laws,\nhave now likewise ended.\nCOMMENT. Aside from the fact that it\nwas a federal tax refund claim in Windsor\nthat triggered the litigation that found\nitself before the U.S. Supreme Court, the\nopinion focused on Constitutional rights\nand privileges, without any technical\nCCH Tax Briefing\n©2013 CCH Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.\nJune 27, 2013\n3\ndiscussion of the tax law itself. The Court\njudged DOMA for its impact on “over\n1,000 federal statutes and the whole\nrealm of federal regulations.” Very little\nwas said specifically about federal tax law\nbeyond that. Nevertheless, the federal tax\nlaw is clearly among those “federal statutes\nand regulations” impacted most directly\nby the Supreme Court’s holding.\nIMPACT. Same-sex couples who were married\nunder state law for years prior to 2013\nnow need to decide whether to amend those\nprior-year returns still open under the Code’s\nstatute of limitations, to reflect a change\nfrom unmarried to married filing status.\nSame-sex married couples also should consider\nupdating their estate plans, based upon\nthe estate and gift tax impact of Windsor.\nINCOME TAX BENEFITS\nAND DISADVANTAGES\nBecause of the Supreme Court’s decision, the\nsame tax benefits and disadvantages faced by\njust-married, opposite-sex couples—in changing\nfrom filing as separate, unmarried individuals\nto filing as married filing jointly (or\nmarried filing separately)—are now shared by\nsame-sex married couples. Likewise, however,\nthose same-sex couples not married under\nstate law continue to be subject to the same\ndisadvantages and benefits, and face many of\nthe same strategic decisions, as unmarried heterosexual\ncouples under the federal tax law.\nCAUTION. As mentioned, above, resolution\nis pending on the issue of whether\nrecognition or non-recognition of a samesex\nmarriage in the State in which the\nsame-sex couple currently reside controls\nwhether the IRS will treat the couple as\nmarried for federal tax purposes. Most\nfederal agencies have defined marriage in\nthe past based on a couple’s residency and\nnot where they were married.\nFILING STATUS\nA taxpayer’s filing status depends in large\npart—if not exclusively in most cases—on\nthe taxpayer’s marital status. Taxpayers may\nbe single, surviving spouse, head of household,\nmarried filing joint returns, or married\nfiling separately. Filing status, in turn, determines\nthe right to many tax benefits, both in\nterms of access and amount. Income tax rate\nbracket levels, the standard deduction, personal\nexemptions, and the adjusted gross income\n(AGI) amounts at which many tax benefits\n“phaseout” all hinge upon filing status.\nJoint Return Status. Because of the Supreme\nCourt’s Windsor decision, same-sex couples who\ncurrently are married under state law are presumably\nnow also barred for federal tax purposes from\nfiling separate returns as unmarried (or as head of\nhousehold, in most cases); they must file either\njointly or married filing separately for 2013 (unless\nthey are divorced or have a final separation\nagreement in place by the end of 2013). The\ngeneral rule that has always applied to filing status\nnow presumably applies to same-sex married\nstatus as well: an individual’s filing status is determined\nfor the entire year based upon marital\nstatus on December 31 st of that year. The IRS is\nexpected to issue guidance in this area.\nIMPACT. Leading up to the Supreme\nCourt’s decision, many same-sex couples\nfiled protective income tax refund claims\nusing married filing jointly status. A protective\nrefund claim is a claim filed to\nprotect the taxpayer’s right to a potential\nrefund based on a contingent event for\na taxable period for which the period of\nlimitations is about to expire. Now that\nthe Supreme Court’s decision is out, full\nrefund claims, rather than protective\nclaims, should be filed going forward.\nCOMMENT. Under current rules, a taxpayer\ncan sign a joint return if his or her\nspouse is serving in a combat zone. In other\nlimited cases where one spouse cannot sign\nthe joint return, such as because of injury or\nillness, the other spouse may sign the return\nand attach a statement explaining why the\nspouse was unable to sign. Same-sex couples\nwho are married under state law are now\npresumably allowed these signing benefits.\nCOMMENT. Because same-sex marriage\nis relatively new, the tax implications\nof divorce of a same-sex couple are only\nstarting to manifest themselves.\nThe Marriage Penalty. Same-sex married\ncouples who have been denied joint return\nstatus under the federal tax laws prior\nto the Supreme Court’s Windsor decision\nnow need to investigate the effect of joint\nreturn status, both for returns that will be\nfiled in the future and for prior year returns\nstill open within the statute of limitations\nrefund-claim period (generally, but not always,\nthree years from filing – see this Briefing,\nbelow, for a discussion of this deadline).\nThe benefits of filing a joint return may\nnot always be greater than filing separately\nas unmarried individuals. Both differences\nin tax rate bracket amounts and a variety of\nincome floors and thresholds used to determine\nthe right to certain tax breaks come\ninto play in determining whether some\nsame-sex couples were better off, income\ntax-wise, before the Supreme Court’s decision;\nand what they should do now.\nIMPACT. Individuals in a relationship\nwho are not married and who each realize\napproximately the same level of\nNO NATIONWIDE\nEXTENSION OF SAME-\nSEX MARRIAGE\nThe Supreme Court struck down Section\n3 of DOMA, which defined marriage as\na legal union between one man and one\nwoman as husband and wife and defined\nspouse as only a person of the opposite\nsex who is a husband or wife. The\nSupreme Court did not strike down Section\n2 of DOMA, which provides that\nno state, territory or possession of the\nUnited States shall be required to give\neffect to any marriage between persons\nof the same sex under the laws of any\nother such jurisdiction or to any right\nor claim arising from such relationship.\nSection 2 was not challenged and, therefore,\nwas not at issue in Windsor.\nCCH Tax Briefing\n4\n2013 Expert Analysis\nincome and have similar tax deductions\n(at least in amount) have generally been\nbetter off from a tax standpoint filing as\nunmarried individuals. However, that\nassessment tilts in favor of marriage and\nfiling a joint return if one partner earns\nor deducts the greater portion of any otherwise\ncombined amounts.\nCOMMENT. Although much press was\ngiven to “marriage penalty relief” when\nthe Bush-era tax cuts were permanently\nextended by the American Taxpayer Relief\nAct of 2012 (ATRA), such relief in fact\nonly related to equality within the standard\ndeduction amount and the top portion\nof the 15 percent income tax bracket.\nOther “marriage penalties” continue to\nexist within the tax law depending upon\ncircumstances. For example, the 33 percent\ntax bracket for joint filers in 2013\nstarts at $223,050 taxable income, while\nthe 33 percent bracket for single taxpayers\nstarts at $183,250. If there were no marriage\npenalty imposed on higher-income\nindividuals earning similar amounts, the\n33 percent bracket for joint filers would\nnot start until reaching the $366,500\nlevel, or double that set under the Internal\nRevenue Code for single filers.\nMarried Filing Separately. If same-sex\nmarried couples post-Windsor want to keep\ntheir finances (and liabilities) separate for the\npurpose of filing separate returns, they will\ngenerally—but not always—pay more federal\nincome tax. The rate brackets for “married\nfiling separately” are higher than “unmarried,\nnot surviving spouse or head of household.”\nInnocent Spouse Status. Married taxpayers\nwho file joint returns are jointly and severally\nresponsible for the tax and any interest or penalty\ndue on the joint return. In some cases, a\nspouse will be relieved of this shared liability for\ntax owed on a joint tax return. Three types of\nrelief are available: general innocent spouse relief;\nseparate liability relief; and equitable relief.\nIMPACT. Because of the Supreme\nCourt’s decision, the three types of innocent\nspouse relief are now presumably\navailable to same-sex married couples.\nSame-sex married partners cannot turn\na blind eye to any item that is listed on\na joint return. A decision to file joint\nreturns retroactively for prior tax years\nas the result of the Supreme Court’s decision,\ntherefore, should include consideration\nof the joint and several liability\nthat would be triggered. Separate return\nstatus would eliminate the issue of joint\nliability entirely. The IRS is expected to\nissue guidance in this area.\nSurviving Spouse Claims. A surviving\nspouse computes tax using the same rate\nbrackets as married couples filing joint returns.\nRules for surviving spouse status for\nsame-sex married couples now presumably\nfollow the same rules as for opposite-sex\ncouples. If a taxpayer is a surviving spouse,\nthe year the spouse died is the last year for\nwhich the taxpayer can file a joint return\nwith that spouse. A taxpayer can also qualify\nas surviving spouse for two tax years following\nthe year in which his or her spouse\ndies if the taxpayer maintains a household\nfor certain dependents (a child, adopted\nchild, foster child, or stepchild), has not\nremarried, and filed or could have filed a\njoint return with the spouse for the year in\nwhich his or her spouse died.\nFILING STATUS, AGI FLOORS\nAND THRESHOLD AMOUNTS\nThe amounts of income and deductions\nreported on a return are used by the IRS\nin determining whether certain threshold\nlevels and floors are reached. Those\namounts in turn determine access to a variety\nof tax benefits. Some of these floors\nor threshold amounts are applied to all\nfiling statuses uniformly; others vary depending\nupon filing status.\nIMPACT. Depending upon adjusted gross\nincome (AGI) and other levels reported\non a return, combining the income and\ndeductions of each same-sex partner under\na single joint return may or may not\nwork to the advantage of the couple as a\nunit, in contrast to filing as unmarried or\nmarried filing separately.\nFloors. Tax benefits dependent upon floor\nlevels of adjusted gross income (AGI) or\nmodified AGI (MAGI) set forth under the\nInternal Revenue Code include the following\nitemized deduction categories, among others:\nMedical expense deduction floor (10\npercent AGI (temporarily at 7.5 percent\nfor taxpayers over age 65));\nCasualty loss deduction floor (10 percent\nAGI); and\nMiscellaneous items deduction floor (2\npercent AGI).\nCOMMENT. In the case of married individuals\nwho file separate returns, if one\nspouse itemizes deductions on his or her\nreturn, the other spouse must also do so irrespective\nof whether his or her standard\ndeduction would be larger. This rule does\nnot apply to unmarried couples who file\nseparate returns.\nCeilings. Use of excess capital losses to offset\nordinary income is generally limited to\n$3,000 per return, whether on a joint return\nor an unmarried single return. Taxpayers\nwho are married filing separately, however,\nare allowed only a $1,500 maximum capital\nloss deduction; the balance in all cases may\nbe carried forward into the next tax year.\nThresholds. For some taxpayers, AGI above\ndesignated thresholds reduces certain tax\nbenefits. A reduction in itemized deductions\nand a reduction in personal exemptions\nare the most common among higherincome\nindividuals. For example:\nItemized deductions otherwise allowed must\nbe reduced by the lesser of (1) three percent of\nAGI that exceeded a threshold amount (see\nchart, below) adjusted annually for inflation,\nor (2) 80 percent of the total amount of otherwise\nallowable itemized deductions. No reduction\nis required in the case of deductions\nfor medical expenses, investment interest,\nand casualty, theft or wagering losses.\nPersonal exemptions, likewise, are required\nto be reduced where AGI exceeds a specified\nthreshold amount: by two percent for each\n$2,500 (or fraction thereof) by which AGI\nCCH Tax Briefing\n©2013 CCH Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.\nJune 27, 2013\n5\nexceeds the applicable threshold amount\n(see chart, below) for the year ($1,250 for\nmarried persons filing separately).\nNet Capital Gains/ Net Investment Income.\nAGI thresholds are also used in taxing\ninvestment-type income:\nNet Capital Gains are taxed at the 20\npercent maximum rate at levels beyond\nwhich income would otherwise be\npushed into the 39.6 percent bracket\n(for 2013, that applicable threshold\namount is $450,000 AGI for married\nindividuals filing joint returns and surviving\nspouses, $425,000 for heads of\nhouseholds, $400,000 for single individuals,\nand $225,000 for married individuals\nfiling separate returns. (The\n“regular” 15 percent capital gains rate\nis likewise reduced to zero percent for\ntaxpayers in the 10 percent bracket—\na benefit that can be used by same-sex\ncouples where one partner has very\nlittle income).\nNet Investment Income, as defined under\nnew Code Section 1411, is taxed\nstarting in 2013 at 3.8 percent, keyed\nto a modified AGI threshold based on\nfiling status ($250,000 for joint filers;\n$125,000 for married, filing separately;\nand $200,000 for all others).\nDeduction/Credit Thresholds. Thresholds\nare also commonly used to restrict deductions,\ncredits and other benefits based upon adjusted\ngross income and filing status:\n2013 AGI (MAGI) PHASEOUT THRESHOLD START POINTS\nJoint Return Single Married Filing Separately\nItemized Deductions: $300,000 $250,000 $150,000\nPersonal Exemptions: $300,000 $250,000 $150,000\nMaximum Net Capital Gains: $450,000 $400,000 $225,000\nNet Investment Income Surtax: $250,000 $200,000 $125,000\nAdditional Medicare Tax: $250,000 $200,000 $125,000\nChild Tax Credit: $110,000 $75,000 $55,000\nAmerican Opportunity Credit: $160,000 $80,000 $0\nLifetime Learning Credit: $107,000 $53,000 $0\nIRA Deduction (plan participants): $95,000 $59,000 *\nRoth IRA Eligibility: $178,000 $112,000 **\n*Deduction determined under single status if not living with spouse at anytime during tax year; otherwise partial deduction if MAGI is less than\n$10,000 and no deduction if MAGI is $10,000 or more\n**$10,000 if lived with spouse at anytime during tax year; $112,000 if did not live with spouse at anytime during tax year\nIMPACT. In dealing with threshold\namounts, a benefits/drawbacks analysis generally\ndepends upon the extent to which that\nportion of any tax benefit below a threshold\namount would otherwise go unused by\none of the partners if filing separately. With\ncertain deductions, credits or contribution\nlevels, however, electing “married filing separately”\nstatus may relegate each spouse to\n$0 benefit depending upon circumstances.\nOTHER SAME-SEX COUPLE\nINCOME TAX ISSUES\nBeing married for federal tax purposes—exclusive\nof the right to any particular filing\nstatus—can also give rise to additional tax\nbenefits and restrictions. The following situations\nmay be particularly relevant in the\ncase of married same-sex couples after the\nSupreme Court’s Windsor decision:\nDependency Exemptions. In 2012, the\nIRS explained on its website that if a child\nis a qualifying child under Code Sec. 152(c)\nand both parents are same-sex partners,\neither parent, but not both, may claim a\ndependency deduction for the qualifying\nchild if separate returns are filed. If both\nparents can otherwise claim a dependency\ndeduction for the child on their income tax\nreturns, the IRS will treat the child as the\nqualifying child of the parent with whom\n“Same-sex couples may\nfind that the benefits of\nfiling a joint return may\nnot always be greater than\nfiling separately...”\nthe child resides for the longer period of\ntime. If the child resides with each parent\nfor the same amount of time during the tax\nyear, the IRS will treat the child as the qualifying\nchild of the parent with the higher adjusted\ngross income.\nCCH Tax Briefing\n6\n2013 Expert Analysis\nCOMMENT. The Supreme Court decision\nwill presumably trigger tie-breaker\nrules and divorce settlement agreements\npreviously available only to opposite-sex\nmarried couples.\nEducation Benefits. Access to a number of\neducation tax credits by same-sex couples\nhas been limited, both because of a student’s\nstatus as a member or non-member of the\ntaxpayer’s family and because lower phaseout\nlevels that apply to unmarried filers.\nAOTC and Lifetime Learning Credit:\nA taxpayer can claim the American Opportunity\nTax Credit (AOTC) or the\nLifetime Learning Credit for qualified\nexpenses paid by the taxpayer for the\neducation of the taxpayer, the taxpayer’s\nspouse, or the taxpayer’s claimed dependent\nfor the tax year for which the credit\nis claimed. Because of DOMA, a taxpayer\ncould not claim the AOTC or Lifetime\nLearning Credit for qualified expenses\npaid by his or her same-sex spouse.\nCoverdell Education Savings Accounts.\nA Coverdell Education Savings\nAccount (ESA) is a savings vehicle\nsimilar to an individual retirement\naccount (IRA). If a Coverdell ESA\nis transferred to a surviving spouse as\nthe result of the beneficiary’s death,\nthe Coverdell ESA retains its status\nand the spouse may treat the account\nas his or her own and need not withdraw\nthe assets as a result of the transfer.\nBecause of DOMA, this treatment\nhad been unavailable to the surviving\nspouse of a same-sex married couple.\nIRA Withdrawals For Education.\nTaxpayers who own IRAs (traditional,\nRoth, SEP IRAs and SIMPLE\nIRAs) can make penalty-free withdrawals\nto pay higher education expenses\nto the extent the distribution\ndoes not exceed the qualified higher\neducation expenses of the taxpayer,\nthe taxpayer’s spouse, or the child or\ngrandchild of the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s\nspouse. Once again, because\nof DOMA, this treatment had been\nunavailable to the surviving spouse of\na same-sex married couple.\nPost-Death IRA Payments. When a surviving\nspouse is the beneficiary of an individual\nretirement account (IRA) he or she has certain\noptions not granted to other beneficiaries,\nincluding the ability to rollover the decedent’s\nIRA, tax free, to another retirement\nplan. And, if the surviving spouse is the sole\nbeneficiary, he or she can elect to treat the\nIRA as if it were his or her own. These options\nmay allow the survivor to delay the\nstart of required minimum distributions\n(RMDs) from the account and to stretch\nout the payment of RMDs over a longer period\nof time. DOMA had foreclosed these\nmore favorable spousal benefits for same-sex\nmarried spouses. The Supreme Court’s decision\nin Windsor presumably opens up these\ndistribution benefits to same-sex spouses.\n“In the case of family\nattribution rules, it is\nunclear whether application\nof marital status for samesex\nspouses relates back\nto transactions already\ncompleted.”\nFamily Stock Attribution Rules. Code Sec.\n267 contains attribution rules designed to\nprevent related taxpayers (including “spouses”\nunder Sec. 267(c)(4)) from recognizing\nlosses and other tax benefits otherwise allowed\nin a variety of transactions. For example,\nan individual is treated under Code\nSec. 318(a)(1) as constructively owning stock\nowned directly or indirectly by his or her\nspouse (unless legally separated), children,\ngrandchildren, or parents. Stock attribution\nrules under Code Sec. 318 apply when determining\nwhether a redemption of stock is\ntreated as a sale or exchange or as a dividend.\nLikewise, prohibited transactions involving\npension plans under Code Sec. 4975 are\ndefined, in part, upon dealing with certain\npersons, including spouses of those persons.\nIMPACT. The Supreme Court’s grant of\nfederal marital status to same-sex married\npersons is apparently not only prospective\nstarting June 26, 2013, the date of the\nWindsor decision, but also presumably\napplies retroactively to all open years.\nNevertheless, in the case of attribution\nrules, application of marital status for\nsame-sex spouses may not necessarily relate\nback to transactions already completed.\nThe need under the tax laws to\nhave finality for transactions as they occur\nappears to be the overriding argument\nin favor of not giving retroactive effect to\nfamily attribution. Eventual IRS guidance\non this issue is anticipated.\nResident And Non-Resident Aliens. Presumably,\nthe Supreme Court’s decision applies\nto same-sex resident or nonresident\naliens to the extent they are considered married\nunder the law of a foreign jurisdiction.\nFurther clarification of the application of\nthe Supreme Court’s Windsor decision to\nthese taxpayers may be needed.\nESTATE AND GIFT TAXATION\nThe Windsor case, as discussed above in this\nBriefing, involved the estate tax marital deduction.\nThe marital deduction is a key planning\ntool to defer transfer taxes until the\nsurviving spouse dies. Because of DOMA,\nsame-sex married couples could not take\nadvantage of the estate tax marital deduction\nand other provisions, such as portability.\nDOMA also precluded same-sex married\ncouples from the benefits of special rules for\ngifts between spouses and from spouses.\nMarital Deduction. Code Sec. 2056 provides\nan unlimited deduction from the gross estate\nfor property passing from a decedent to a surviving\nspouse. Generally, the decedent must\nbe survived by his or her spouse who is a U.S.\ncitizen at the time of the decedent’s death, the\nproperty interest must have passed from the\ndecedent to the spouse, and the property interest\nmust be a deductible interest. Additionally,\nthe property’s value must be ascertainable.\nIMPACT. The relatively high $5.25 million\nestate tax exclusion for 2013 for\nall estates makes addition of a marital\nCCH Tax Briefing\n©2013 CCH Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.\nJune 27, 2013\n7\ndeduction unnecessary in the majority of\ncases. However, as Windsor showed, it is\na valuable tax benefit for larger estates.\nMany same-sex married couples may find\nit valuable to revisit their estate plans to\nmake certain that interests passing to the\nother spouse qualify for the marital deduction\nand other tax benefits.\nPortability. The American Taxpayer Relief\nAct of 2012 extended permanently the concept\nof portability, which generally allows\nthe estate of a surviving spouse to utilize the\nunused portion of the estate tax applicable\nexclusion amount of his or her last predeceased\nspouse. Because of DOMA, only\nopposite-sex married couples could take advantage\nof portability.\nIMPACT. The Supreme Court’s decision\npresumably enables same-sex married\ncouples to take advantage of portability as\npart of their estate planning. The IRS is\nexpected to issue guidance.\nGifts. Because of DOMA, only oppositesex\nmarried couples were allowed to “split”\ngifts to take advantage of a doubled annual\ngift tax exclusion ($14,000 for 2013, for\na total tax-free gift of $28,000). DOMA\npresented even more of a disadvantage\nfor same-sex married couples in that only\ntransfers between spouses, where both individuals\nare U.S. citizens, are allowed an\nunlimited gift tax exclusion under Code\nSec. 2523.\nIMPACT. Same-sex married couples can\nnow presumably transfer assets between\nthemselves with no concern of lifetime gift\ntax consequences. This creates considerably\ngreater flexibility for estate planning.\nThe IRS is expected to issue guidance.\nCOMMENT. Gifts to cover medical and\neducation expenses for an individual, if\npaid directly to the medical or education\nprovider, are gift tax free without limit\nand are not counted against the annual\n$14,000 exclusion for any individual.\nCOMMENT. Where one spouse is not a\nU.S. citizen, the annual exclusion from\ngift taxes for gifts made to the noncitizen\nspouse is $143,000 for 2013.\nEMPLOYEE BENEFITS\nPerhaps in no area outside of income taxes is\nthe impact of the Supreme Court’s decision\nmore expansive than on employee benefits.\nBecause of DOMA, employers that allow an\nemployee to add his or her same-sex spouse\nto their health plan had to impute income\nto the employee for federal income tax purposes\nequal to the fair market value of health\ncoverage provided to the same-sex spouse.\nIf the same-sex spouse qualified as a dependent,\nthis rule did not apply. DOMA also\nprecluded same-sex married couples from\nsharing the same benefits of health flexible\nspending accounts, health savings accounts\nand health reimbursement arrangements\navailable to opposite-sex married couples.\nIMPACT. Employers in states that allow\nsame-sex marriage will presumably need\nto amend plans to cover same-sex married\nspouses. The IRS is expected to provide guidance\non the timing of plan amendments, including\nthe issue of whether benefits need to\nbe made retroactive or only prospective from\nthe date of the Windsor decision.\nDomestic Partners. Many employee benefit\nplans in the private and public sectors\nrefer to domestic partners rather than samesex\nspouses. The definition of domestic\npartner varies. In some cases, it may encompass\nopposite-sex domestic partners as\nwell as same-sex domestic partners.\nCOMMENT. The federal government’s\nOffice of Personnel Management defines\ndomestic partner for purposes of federal\nemployee benefits as a committed relationship\nbetween two adults, of the same sex.\nTax Treatment. Domestic partners who are\nnot married under state law are not treated\nas spouses for federal income tax purposes.\nAs a result, an employee must continue\nto pay taxes on the fair market value of\nthe coverage for the employee’s domestic\npartner (whether the domestic partner is a\nsame-sex partner or an opposite-sex partner).\nHowever, domestic partner benefits\nare tax-free if the employee’s partner qualifies\nas a dependent under Code Sec. 152;\nthat is, if benefits are paid for a person who\nmeets the following requirements:\nReceives more than half of his or her\nsupport from the taxpayer for the year.\nUses the taxpayer’s home as the principal\nabode and is a member of the taxpayer’s\nhousehold during the entire tax year.\nIs in a relationship with the taxpayer\nthat is not a violation of local law.\nIMPACT. The Supreme Court’s decision\nmay open the window to refunds of taxes\npaid by employees on income imputed to\nemployees for same-sex married spouse\nand refunds of payroll taxes paid by employers\non that income. FICA tax refund\nclaims by employers and employees for\nprior, open years may also be possible.\nCOMMENT. Some employers have attempted\nto equalize the treatment between\nopposite-sex couples and same-sex\ncouples by providing so-called gross-ups\nto cover the additional taxes that samesex\ncouples pay on health benefits. Many\nemployers require an employee to certify\nthat a domestic partner qualifies as a dependent\nunder Code Sec. 152.\nCafeteria Plans. Employer contributions to\na cafeteria plan are usually made under a salary\nreduction agreement between the employer\nand the employee in which the employee agrees\nto contribute a portion of his or her salary on\na pre-tax basis to pay for the qualified benefits.\nSalary reduction contributions are not actually\nor constructively received by the participant.\nTherefore, those contributions are not considered\nwages for federal income tax purposes. In\naddition, those sums generally are not subject to\nFICA and FUTA taxes. However, pre-tax dollars\ncould not be used to pay for coverage of a\nsame-sex spouse because of DOMA. This now\nshould change as a result of the Court’s decision.\nHealth Flexible Spending Accounts. A\nhealth flexible spending arrangement (FSA)\nCCH Tax Briefing\n8\n2013 Expert Analysis\nis a form of cafeteria plan benefit, funded\nby a voluntary salary reduction arrangement\nwith pretax dollars. The benefits are\nsubject to an annual maximum and an annual\n“use-or-lose” rule. Qualified medical\nexpenses are those incurred by, among other\nindividuals, the employee and his or her\nopposite-sex spouse. Because of DOMA,\nonly opposite-sex married couples could use\nhealth FSA dollars for a spouse’s qualified\nmedical expenses.\nIMPACT. The Supreme Court’s decision\nto strike down DOMA presumably opens\nthe door to same-sex married couples being\nable to use FSA dollars for qualified\nmedical expenses of both spouses. The IRS\nis expected to issue guidance.\nCOMMENT. A cafeteria plan may not\nallow an employee to request salary reduction\ncontributions for a health FSA in\nexcess of $2,500 for plan years beginning\nafter December 31, 2012.\nHealth Savings Accounts. A health savings\naccount (HSA) is a vehicle that eligible taxpayers\ncan use to pay for or reimburse qualified\nmedical expenses. Contributions to\nan HSA are tax-deductible (employer contributions\nare excluded from gross income)\nand distributions are tax-free if used to pay\nfor qualified medical expenses. To be an eligible\ntaxpayer, the individual, among other\nrequirements, must be covered by a high-deductible\nhealth plan (HDHP), not enrolled\nin Medicare, not claimed as a dependent on\nanother taxpayer’s return. Qualified medical\nexpenses are those incurred by, among\nothers, the taxpayer and his or her spouse.\nBecause of DOMA, only opposite-sex married\ncouples could HSA dollars for a spouse’s\nqualified medical expenses.\nIMPACT. With DOMA being struck\ndown by the Supreme Court, same-sex\nmarried couples will presumably be able\nto use HSA dollars for qualified medical\nexpenses of both spouses.\nCOBRA/FMLA. Federal law requires that\ncertain employers offer continuation of health\ncare coverage to employees, their spouses,\nand families (“COBRA coverage’). Current\nfederal laws related to COBRA coverage do\nnot apply to same-sex married couples. The\nDOMA definition of spouse precludes the\nextension of Family and Medical Leave Act\n(FMLA) leave benefits to opposite-sex partners.\nAfter the Supreme Court’s decision in\nWindsor, these rights presumably would now\nbe available to same-sex spouses.\n“The IRS is expected\nto provide guidance on\nthe timing of employee\nbenefit plan amendments,\nincluding the issue of\nwhether benefits need to\nbe made retroactive or\nonly prospective.”\nRetirement Plans. The Internal Revenue\nCode provides extensive protections\nfor the spouse of an employee to share in\nthe employee’s retirement benefits payable\nthrough Code Sec. 401(k) plans and other\nqualified plans. These protections would\npresumably now apply to the same-sex\nspouse of an employee.\nAFFORDABLE CARE ACT\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care\nAct, signed into law by President Obama\nin 2010, set in motion a host of changes to\nthe delivery of health care and health insurance\ncoverage. Some of the changes already\nin place affect health savings accounts (discussed\nabove in this Briefing). Other changes\nare scheduled to take effect after 2013.\nIndividual Mandate And Penalty. Beginning\nin 2014, the Affordable Care Act\nimposes a penalty on individuals who do\nnot carry minimum essential health coverage\nfor one or more months, subject\nto certain exceptions. Married taxpayers\nwho file a joint return are jointly liable\nfor any penalty that may be imposed\nupon either spouse. The penalty does not\napply in certain cases, such as in the case\nof individuals whose household incomes\nare below their filing thresholds. Now\nthat DOMA has been struck down, samesex\nmarried couples presumably will be\ntreated in the same manner as oppositesex\nmarried couples for purposes of the\nindividual mandate and its penalty.\nCOMMENT. The Affordable Care Act prohibits\nthe IRS from using liens or levies to\ncollect any unpaid penalty. The IRS cannot\nlevy on the property of one spouse to satisfy\nan unpaid penalty of the other spouse.\nPremium Assistance Tax Credit. Beginning\nin 2014, the Code Sec. 36B premium assistance\ntax credit is scheduled to be available\nto those qualified individuals and families\nwho are not offered minimum essential coverage\nand as a result obtain coverage through\na health benefit exchange. The Affordable\nCare Act provides for advance payment of\nthe credit. Taxpayers who are married at the\nend of the tax year must file a joint return\nto claim the credit. Because DOMA has\nbeen struck down, same-sex married couples\nwill presumably need to file a joint return to\nclaim the credit.\nCode Sec. 45R Credit. For tax years 2010\nthrough 2013, eligible employers may claim\na credit of 35 percent of health insurance\npremiums paid (25 percent for small taxexempt\nemployers). In tax years beginning\nafter 2013, an employer must participate in\nan insurance exchange in order to claim the\ncredit. The credit is scheduled to increase\nto 50 percent for small business employers\n(35 percent for small tax-exempt employers)\nafter 2013 (but will terminate after 2015).\nCertain family members are not treated as\nemployees for purposes of the credit. Under\nDOMA, these restrictions did not apply\nto same-sex married couples because their\nmarriages were not recognized for federal\npurposes. With DOMA’s demise, a samesex\nspouse who satisfies any of these criteria\nwould presumably not be treated as an employee\nfor purposes of the credit.\nCCH Tax Briefing\n©2013 CCH Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.\nJune 27, 2013\n9\nSOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS\nBecause of DOMA, same-sex married couples\ndid not have the same benefits under\nSocial Security that opposite-sex married\ncouples have enjoyed for many years. Unlike\nopposite-sex couples, for example, there are\nno survivor benefits for the surviving spouse\nof a same-sex married couple. Also, the divorced\nspouse of a formerly married samesex\ncouple cannot not claim benefits based\non the earnings of his or her ex-spouse.\nIMPACT. The Social Security Administration\n(SSA) has based federal rights to\nbenefits on whether marital rights exist\nin the couple’s current state of residence\nrather than the state in which they were\nmarried. The impact of Windsor on the\nmanner in which federal agencies will\ntreat Social Security benefits remains to\nbe sorted out.\nSurvivor Benefits. When an individual\ndies, his or her surviving spouse may be\neligible for Social Security benefits if the\nsurviving spouse is age 60 or older, age 50\nor older and disabled, or any age if he or\nshe is caring for the decedent’s child who is\nyounger than age 16 or disabled and entitled\nto Social Security benefits on the record\nof the deceased individual. With DOMA\nhaving been struck down, survivor benefits\npreviously available only to opposite-sex\nmarried couples are now presumably available\nto same-sex married couples. The SSA\nis expected to provide guidance.\nDivorced Spouses. If an individual is divorced,\nhis or her ex-spouse may qualify\nfor Social Security benefits based on that\nindividual’s earnings. Generally, a divorced\nspouse must have been married to the individual\nfor at least 10 years and have been\ndivorced at least two years. Additionally,\nthe divorced spouse must be at least age\n62, unmarried and ineligible for an equal\nor greater benefit based on his or her own\nearnings or the earnings of someone else.\nThese benefits are now presumably available\nto divorced individuals who were previously\nin a same-sex marriage. The SSA is expected\nto provide guidance.\nDeath Benefits. The SSA pays a onetime\ndeath benefit of $255 to the decedent’s\nsurviving spouse in an opposite-sex\nmarriage or minor child. The SSA will\npresumably now pay the one-time death\nbenefit to the surviving spouse in a samesex\nmarriage.\nEFFECTIVE-DATE ISSUES\nDetermination of the effective date for applying\nthe Supreme Court’s holding to federal\ntax law is not straightforward in all cases\nand will necessitate further guidance from\nthe IRS. Same-sex married couples who\nwere not considered married under federal\nlaw prior to the Supreme Court decision\nare presumably not just considered married\nstarting on the date of the Supreme Court’s\ndecision, June 26, 2013 but are considered\nmarried retroactively to the date of their\nmarriage pursuant to state law. This retroactive\neffective date raises a number of immediate\nfederal tax issues:\nShould same-sex couples now file\namended returns claiming joint return\nstatus?\nAre same-sex couples now required to\namend past-year returns for joint status\neven if they did better tax-wise overall\nby filing separately as unmarried individuals?\nWill the IRS consider the Supreme\nCourt’s decision in determining marital\nstatus when auditing prior-year returns?\nAmended Joint Returns/Claims For Refund.\nAmended returns are filed to correct\nerrors made on previous returns. Although\nthe Internal Revenue Code does not specifically\npermit amended returns, the IRS usually\naccepts them. But while the IRS’s discretion\nto accept or reject amended returns\nhas been recognized, courts have required\nthe IRS to accept amended returns where\nits rejection of them has been found to be\narbitrary and unjust.\nLimitations Period. The statute of limitations\nfor amending or auditing a return is\nSTATES THAT\nRECOGNIZE SAME-SEX\nMARRIAGE\nConnecticut\nDelaware(1)\nIowa\nMaine\nMaryland\nMassachusetts\nMinnesota(2)\nNew Hampshire\nNew York\nRhode Island(2)\nVermont\nWashington\nDistrict of Columbia\n*As of June 27, 2013\n(1) Effective July 1, 2013\n(2) Effective August 1, 2013\nNote: California granted marriage licenses\nto same-sex couples from June\n16, 2008 to November 5, 2008.\nNote: The Little Traverse Bay Bands of\nOdawa Indians in Michigan, the Coquille\nNative American Nation in Oregon and\nthe Suquamish Native American Nation in\nWashington recognize same-sex marriage.\nNote: 37 States have laws expressly\nrestricting marriage to opposite-sex\ncouples.\nSTATES THAT\nRECOGNIZE SAME-SEX\nUNIONS/DOMESTIC\nPARTNERSHIPS\nCalifornia\nColorado\nHawaii\nIllinois\nNevada\nNew Jersey\nOregon\nWisconsin\ngenerally three years from the filing date or\ntwo years from the date taxes are paid, whichever\nis later. This rule may generally apply for\nsame-sex married couples as follows:\nCCH Tax Briefing\n10\n2013 Expert Analysis\nJoint returns may be filed, usually as an\namended return with a refund claim,\nuntil the three-year limitations period\n(or the two-year payment period, if\nlater) expires. For individuals who filed\n2009 tax returns on or before April\n15, 2010, the limitations period for\nthat year is closed. For those who filed\ntheir 2009 returns on an automatic sixmonth\nextension on October 15, 2010,\nhowever, the limitations period for the\n2009 tax year remains open until October\n15, 2013. To claim joint return\nstatus on an amended 2009 tax return\nunder the three-year rule, both married\npartners’ original tax returns must have\nbeen filed within that extended period.\nTaxpayers who filed protective refund\nclaims prior to the Supreme Court’s decision\nshould be on the alert to any forthcoming\nIRS guidelines that may facilitate\nthe agency’s processing of those claims.\nTaxpayers who had a lower combined\noverall tax liability filing as unmarried single\nindividuals during an open year appear\nto be under no obligation now to file an\namended return to file jointly (or as married\nfiling separately if at least one partner\ndoes not consent to a joint return).\nIRS Audit Policy. Technically, the IRS, on\naudit of an open year for which any previously-filed\nreturn by a married, same-sex\npartner used unmarried, single-filer status,\nmay be able to require that tax be recomputed\nbased on either a joint return, or married\nfiling separately status return. However,\nsince audits are under IRS’s discretionary\npowers, the consensus among at least some\npractitioners, is that IRS National Office\nmay –and more likely will— direct agents\nto by-pass any filing-status issues unless the\ntaxpayer requests a change.\n2013 Tax Year. For 2013 returns that will be\nfiled in 2014, the Supreme Court’s Windsor\ndecision presumably relates back to the entire\n2013 tax year in determining filing status.\nCOMMENT. Married partners do not have\nthe option to file short-year returns as unmarried\nfor the January 1 – June 26, 2013\nperiod; they must file jointly or married filing\nseparately for the entire 2013 tax year.\n2012 Tax Year. Taxpayers who are on extension\nuntil October 15, 2013 for filing their\n2012 tax year returns appear to be required\nto file those returns either jointly or married\nfiling separately. Taxpayers who filed their\n2012 tax year returns before June 26, 2013,\nas separate, unmarried individuals, however,\nmay not need to change their filing status to\nmarried filing joint if it would be less favorable\nto their overall tax liability. The IRS\nmay issue guidance on this issue.\nCCH Tax Briefing\n©2013 CCH Incorporated.

Ping An & CICC are the 2 H shares that operate in the middle of Alibaba, Tencent, Lufax. \nA. The chart below represents a deep dive we did on the new world of Chinese banking. Companies \nlike Zhong An, WeBank and Lufax will grow dramatically and will take advantage of (as well as \nsupport) the massive worlds of Alibaba and Tencent. Together, Alibaba and Tencent have market cap \nof $500 bn. Popping up in many of these areas of overlap are Ping An and CICC. They are \nstrategically placed to make great strides in China. This is slowly being recognized in the case of Ping \nAN (See Page 8 of attached PPT). Ping An's market cap is $97 bn. It is connected to Zhong An.. It \nowns 44% of Lufax. And some if its management were the very ones that started WeBank. It is \nperfectly positioned for the coming boom in new banking. It has the best combined ROA and ROE \nglobally and its P/E of 10x is trading on a 50% discount to the global averages. Why is Ping An \ntrading at a discount to AIA? BUY PING AN -- SELL AIA.. \nB. The other company which has the best return on capital of any broker dealer -- and is also  \npositioned nicely for the coming boom in the new era of banking in China -- is CICC. CICC and CDH \n(a CICC breakaway) both invested in Zhong An and Lufax. CICC has vision and a proven track record. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026037 \nYet it has been a laggard. This is a top pick for H shares for China in 2017. The other bank with great \nvision in this area is CCB, which has invested in Ant Financial. BUY H shares CCB and CICC. (See \nattached PPT for portfolios and China fintech details). \nC. IPOs in 2017. I think Zhong An will be a surprise for 2017 in the Hong Kong market. Its market \ncap is expected to be $10 bn and it has interesting potential in so many areas of insurance. It \nremains an insurance company whose marginal cost of a new customer is zero. It has a talented \nteam of 900 engineers and has new Al and blockchain divisions. It is rolling out an impressive array \nof products including corporate solutions for insurance and investment plans. Lufax CEO Greg Gibb \nmade a big splash at the Finnovasia (Schulte Research co-sponsored it) in Hong Kong last month. \nThe company is a diversified financial conglomerate akin to \"Schwab meets etrade and Fidelity\" --\nonly 25 years ago. It needs an IPO north of $25 bn in order for the private equity partners to make \nmoney. Lastly, Ant Financial will come to the market for a $60 bn IPO in 2017 -- also in Hong Kong. \nThis is a mothership company that goes to the heart of China's system. Its early investors are CIC, \nCDB, CCB, China Life and other vital organs of the system. It will not be allowed to fail. There are \nsome questions about whether to own this through Alibaba, since Alibaba will own 33% of Ant post \nIPO. I'm in this camp. Buy Alibaba on this pullback. (See attached PPT for the full China Fintech \nReport). \n2. Koch Industries saturates both the offices of Trump as well as Pence. Mega bullish for Russia, oil \nand gas companies. Mega bearish for alternative energy. \nA. The Koch Brothers are not just two grumpy men -- they are a political party. Koch Industries is the \nsecond biggest private company in the US after Cargill. They operate public and secretive political \nentities in 32 states and dole out more than $500 million each political cycle to various entities in the \nstrongest places. The political entities employ more than 1,200 people and the amount of donations \navailable to right wing causes varies dramatically but is as high as $750 million per cycle. It is the \nthird largest party in the US after the Democratic and Republican party. It controls the Libre Alliance, \nAmericans for Prosperity, Freedom Partners, Institute for Energy Research, American Energy Alliance \nand Concerned Veterans. \nB. What do they do with their money? They support right wing Republican candidates for all \norganizations -- attorneys general, Senate, House and state political figures. This is where it gets \ninteresting. Freedom Partners is thought of as the \"Koch bank\". Guess who ran this? Marc Short. It \ncontrols about $250 mn in funds for political activity. Guess who employed Marc Short as chief of \nstaff? Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Guess who then employed him as chief of staff? President-elect \nTrump. Matt Lloyd is in charge of communications and strategy for VP-elect Pence -- he came from \nKoch Industries. Governor Pence was a frequent attendee of the secretive semi-annual meetings of \nthe Koch Brothers. Guess who raised more than $100 million for Freedom Partners? Don McGahn. \nGuess who is the new White House Counsel for President-elect Trump? Don McGahn. (McGahn was \nembroiled in the Tom Delay scandal in the 2000s). Guess who had two companies which had Koch \nBrothers as investors and whose chief of staff (Chenowith) came from the Koch world? The new CIA-\ndesignate chief Mike Pompeo. (Pompeo's Kansas campaign received a $900,000 donation from Koch). \nGuess who gave $1 mn to Americans for Prosperity? Education secretary designate Betsy Devos. \nGuess who has written the strategy paper for the Department of Energy transition? Tom Pyle -- He is \naffiliated with the Koch Industries Office of federal Affairs and the Institute for Energy Research. \nGuess who was caught up in a Koch Industries scandal for a petrochemical port project (with a Koch \naffiliated Messr. Henneberry)? Governor Nikki Haley who is UN Ambassador designate. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026038 \nC. Advisors are ALL Koch-related. Here is where it gets fun. Former campaign advisor Corey \nLewandowski came from KochLand. Rebekah Mercer is part of Koch and and gave $2.5 mn to \nFreedom Partners. Kellyanne Conway has connections to Pence from way back and is connected to \nSteve Bannon through the Center for National Policy. Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie \ncame from Citizens United. The Director of Coalitions for Trump is named Alan Cobb -- he came from \nAmericans for Prosperity. Daren Se!nick is a transition advisor and he came from Concerned \nVeterans. Others on the Trump team who came from Kochland include Stuart Jolly, Eli Miller, Scott \nHagerstrom and Matt Ciepielowski. \n3. BUY the hell out of Russia -- Exxon Rex is a cabinet trifecta for Koch Brothers. \nA. And there's Exxon Rex. Any contribution from Exxon received money from Koch -- and vice versa. \nRex Tillerson is worth $151 million and is leaving Exxon next year. He seems to have accepted \nsecretary of state position. He inked a deal worth $300 billion in oil and gas exploration in 2012. (For \nthat, he received the highest civilian honour bestowed by Russia). This will be a boom for Koch \nIndustries as the sanctions against Russia are lifted. (Thank you Uncle Vlad for interfering in the \nelections). This will be a boom for Russia -- for equities, FX and bonds. It is clear that sanctions \nagainst Russia will be lifted regardless of whether Russia interfered in the elections. (Clinton made \nthis a campaign issue and still lost!). \nB. Anyone who thinks this will be reversed by Greenpeace or other green organization is kidding  \nthemselves. The Senate and House is Republican. Majority parties control all committees so they \ncontrol the agenda. The agenda is set. These guys are geniuses with the news cycle. And the vast \narray of think tanks controlled by the Koch Brothers (most of them) allows them to control the news \ncycle as well as the opinion pages of newspapers. The web on control on public opinion from the \nKoch Brothers reaches every newspaper through a large array of think tanks like the AEI and Cato \nInstitute, not to mention the vast array of Koch think tanks. \nC. If you don't like this, tough luck. Life is not fair. This is not going to be reversed. Think of it as \nwatching a science experiment. Bush lost the popular vote to Gore in 2001 and completely reversed \npolicies on tax, environment, Middle East, energy, fracking, birth control, and LGBT issues. Trump, \nPence, Bannon and Koch will make a deal which will be a hybrid of religious right on moral issues and \n\"zero intrusion from government\" in commerce. Republicans already control the Senate, the House, a \nmajority of governorships as well as a majority of attorneys general. It will be very hard to reverse \nthis. And if Trump can deliver jobs to the midwest red states, more senate seats will turn red. Tom \nPyle's list of things to for the Department of Energy's transition team is expressly designed to do this. \nThis includes new oil and gas leasing projects, more fracking, more coal, more LNG projects -- and a \ngreen light for both the Keystone and Dakota pipelines. The working paper reneges on the Paris pact, \nthe Clean Power Plan and the carbon tax. And it is expressly a climate change denial policy. States \nlike North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Iowa, Texas, Louisiana, West Virginia, Kansas and \nothers will come to life again.. Most of these states have small populations but each gets a governor \nand two senators. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026039 \nThis report is published and distributed by IND-X Advisors Limited (\"IND-X\").

Even if we included a few smaller parties,\nthere was no choice but to bring in one of the two larger ones: the Sephardi\nOrthodox Shas, with 17 seats; or Likud, which, after Bibi’s sudden resignation,\nwas now led by Arik Sharon, and had 19.\n\nIt wasn’t just a math problem. It had a critical policy implication. If I wanted to\ntackle the domestic challenge — to reassert the values of secular-led democratic\ngovernment over increasingly assertive religious involvement in our day-to-day\npolitics — that would mean choosing Likud over Shas. But it would also signal the\neffective end of the peace process. Even though Arik assured me privately that he\nunderstood my determination to reopen peace efforts with Arafat and Hafez al-\nAssad, I knew Arik. The path toward peace agreements, assuming they were even\npossible, would be tough. Sooner or later — and certainly if we faced the need to\nconsider painful compromises in the negotiations — I was certain that Arik would\nact as a kind of opposition from within. That was why, over the angry opposition\nof Meretz leader Yossi Sarid, I decided to go with the Sephardi Orthodox party. I\nrealized that even Shas might walk out if the scale of any land-for-peace\nconcessions proved too high. But it was the least extreme of the major religious\nparties on the question of peace with the Palestinians. In my conversations with the\nparty’s spiritual leader and guide, the 79-year-old rabbi and Talmudic scholar\nOvadia Yosef, I was struck by his intelligence, erudition and subtletly of thought —\nbut, above all, his commitment to the core Jewish principle of sanctifying human\nlife over the specifics of Oslo redeployments, where his inclination seemed to be to\ntrust the judgment of those with the experience and expertise to evaluate the\nsecurity implications.\n\nTo Meretz’s additional consternation, I included two smaller, right-of-center\nOrthodox parties in the coalition. It was not just to make good on my pledge to be\nPrime Minister for a// Israelis. Knowing that I was going to put top priority on the\npeace process, I wanted to avoid an undiluted left-of-centre, secular thrust to the\ngovernment. When I’d stood in front of the tens of thousands of cheering\nsupporters in Rabin Square after the election, I thought to myself: they think that\nwith Bibi gone, peace is around the corner.

By telling a reporter \"I'm \nan offender\", he seems to be admitting guilt. \nWhich brings me to the big question of the day. Why did Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan D.A., allow a \nLevel 3 sex offender (the most dangerous kind) to reside -- even for ten minutes -- in a house that is right \nnext to Central Park and a school? Isn't that unlawful given the housing guidelines for sex offenders? \nAccording to the NYPost, Epstein's Level 3 designation means that he is at \"high risk\" to repeat his \noffense and poses \"a threat to public safety.\" \nWhen I rang Vance (twice) to discuss Epstein's residential guidelines he did not take my calls. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022250 \nAccording to a few of the attorneys who represented Epstein's victims in the civil cases, the financier \nnever agreed to a psychological evaluation prior to or during his sentence, a requirement of all sexual \npredators. \nWhile Epstein's self-incriminating statements are published (this week he told the Post \"the crime that \nwas supposedly committed in Florida is not a crime in New York\" -- an interesting choice of words -- he \ncontinues to mock the law that applies to all other sex offenders who are found guilty of the same crime. \nEpstein served 13 months in the West Palm Beach Stockade and 18 months under community control (a \nrather permissive version of house arrest), for 2 Counts of Solicitation of Prostitution with a Minor. \nIn August of 2010, immediately following his release from \"community control\", Epstein returned to his \n$50 million East 71st Street town house given to him by his former client and long time friend Leslie \nWexner. \nJust in the last few weeks he held a house warming dinner to celebrate his release from jail and \nreportedly invited television reporters Katie Couric, Charlie Rose, George Stephanopoulus and his close \nfriend, HRH Prince Andrew, according to the NY Post. \nYou would think these professional television reporters would have done their homework prior to \naccepting his invitation no matter how desperate they were to rub elbows with Prince Andrew. \nAccording to a 53-page sealed indictment Epstein was facing 10 years to life on multiple counts of \nstatutory rape, and child sex trafficking. \nCourt documents in that case claimed he routinely sought out girls as young as 14 and paid them $200 to \n$1,000 for sexually explicit massages in his homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and Manhattan. \nIn the New York sex-offender database, Epstein isn't registered under a zip code rather a \"name search\" \noption that does not list his New York address. \nThe reason for this is because Epstein's Upper East Side home is considered \"temporary\" and by NY state \nlaw, he is required to provide only his permanent address to the database. \nEpstein is currently listed under his Florida home even though he is no longer a Florida resident either \n(after his arrest he immediately became a US VI resident), but then again who's keeping count? \nOnce again these are mere technicalities when it comes to Epstein's sexual predator case. The two most \ndisturbing parts of this story are that this could easily happen again and that once again there will be no \njustice. \nHad Epstein been a caring benefactor contributing to society and these young girl's education and well \nbeing then the world would have judged him differently. \nWhat he has done instead is the exact opposite -- causing enormous damage to hundreds of underage \ngirls who could have been sponsored towards a better education. \nWith respect to Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance, I'm confused by his decision to allow this sexual predator to \nlive at his Fifth Avenue house all this time (since August 2010), given his rather tough stance on gun \ncontrol as witnessed by his testimony in Friday's NYPost when asked about a Florida driver cleared in a \nManhattan weapon's charge, \"guns brought illegally into New York City\" he said, \" for any reason \nviolate well established state laws and are a threat to our public safety\". \nThen wouldn't a registered sex offender living 500 feet from a park (Central Park where young girls \ncongregate), and with resources to spare be an even more dangerous threat to society? \nThe Billionaire Pedophile's Sex Den \nby Conchita Sarnoff javascriptvoid(0) \n• javascript:;javascript:; \n• http://www.thedailybeast.comiblogs- and-stories/2010-07-22/jeffrey-epstein-pedophile-billionaire-and-his-sex-dendull/ \n• javascript:void(0) \n• javascript:void(0) \n• Email \n• javascript:void(0) \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022251 \nNewscom Hedge fund mogul and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who  went free this week, lived in a \ndepraved world of thrice-daily massages, pornographic artwork, and hush money—that's only \nnow being revealed. Conchita Sarnoff reports on the sordid details in part two of her exclusive \nexposé. Also: \n• Nude images of young girls were scattered around the house and the bathroom soap was shaped \nlike sex organs \n• Staff trolled for fresh recruits to make sure Epstein had two or three massage appointments each \nday \n• The house manager has been sentenced to a longer prison term than Epstein—for trying to sell \nnotes regarding massage appointments \n• Epstein gave $1 million to his friend Jean Luc Brunel when he was starting the modeling agency \nMC2 \n• According to a former bookkeeper, young girls were brought to the U.S. by MC2—often from \nEastern Europe—then traveled on Epstein's private jets \nJeffrey Epstein's loyal friends say that his prosecution was unduly harsh, rather than outrageously \nlenient. They insist that his sexual habits, although obsessive and unusual, were mostly legal and \nessentially harmless. As the police records attest, the girls brought to El Brillo Way were routinely told \nthey could \"say no\" at any time during a massage as Epstein escalated contact in a step-by-step assault \nthat was remarkably similar in every victim's statement: First she would be asked to remove her shirt, \nthen her pants. He would attempt to fondle her buttocks and breasts as he masturbated, then bring out a \nlarge vibrator. There was sometimes digital penetration, and the more willing girls were lured into full-\nblown sexual relations with both Epstein and Nadia Marcinkova, who was referred to in press accounts \nand police reports as Epstein's live-in \"sex slave.\" \nA former bookkeeper in the Miami office, who also arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S., \nconfirmed that MC2 girls became frequent guests on Epstein's private jets. \nIt's true that some underage girls may have lied about their age, and some came to the house voluntarily \nseveral times—although, according to Florida statutes, none of that has any bearing on the criminality of \nthe contact, particularly if the girl was 16 or younger. But what is particularly disturbing about this \ncase—judging by arrangements at the Palm Beach house—is that Epstein, a billionaire hedge-fund \nmanager, organized his life around this sexual compulsion in an open and methodical way that suggests \nhe felt he was beyond the law. \n• Conchita Sarnoff: Epstein Faces Sex Traffic Probe  \n• Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free  \nAccording to police who executed a search warrant, the house was decorated with large, framed photos \nof nude young girls, and similar images were found stashed in an armoire and on the computers seized at \nthe house (although police found only bare cables where other computers had been). Some bathrooms \nwere stocked with soap in the shape of sex organs, and various sex toys, such as a \"twin torpedo\" \nvibrator and creams and lubricants available at erotic specialty shops, were stowed near the massage \ntables set up in several rooms upstairs. \nEpstein also enlisted his staff in the predatory activity, and four—Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley \nGroff, and Marcinkova—figured in the FBI investigation. The Non Prosecution Agreement stipulated \nthat they would not be charged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all \nfour women, among their other duties, worked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-\ndaily \"massages\" was stocked with fresh recruits. Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late \nCzechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years Epstein's live-in partner, \nalso recruited young girls. \nSince his 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has settled more than a \ndozen lawsuits brought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days \nbefore a scheduled trial; each received well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's \n$2 billion net worth. \nThe victims told police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef \noften gave them a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Rodriguez said in his sworn statement that a maid \nnamed Lupita, who was a devout Catholic, wept when she complained to him about cleaning up after the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022252 \nmassage sessions, picking up soiled towels and putting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo \nof Epstein with the pope hung next to one of him with a young girl. \nIronically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2004 and 2005, ended up being sentenced \nto more jail time than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein's activities. He was \nfired, he says, for inadvertently drawing police attention to one of the girls when she arrived at the house \nunannounced to collect money. He saw an unfamiliar \"beater\" in the driveway one evening and called \n911. When he left Epstein's employ, Rodriguez took away some notes and emails about massage \nappointments as \"protection\" against his own prosecution, and failed to produce them during the Palm \nBeach Police Department's initial investigation. \n• javascript:;javascript:; \n• http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs- and-stories/2010-07-22/jeffrey-epstein-pedophile-billionaire-and-his-sex-den/full/ \n• javascript:void(0) \n• javascript:void(0) \n• Email \n• javascript:void(0) \nUnable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell \nthis \"golden nugget\"—his term—for $50,000, to be used in the victims' civil suits. Unfortunately, he \nmade the offer to an undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with \"obstruction of official \nproceedings\" for withholding information that could have advanced the criminal investigation of \nEpstein—which by that point had been settled in a plea deal. Rodriguez was sentenced to 18 months in \nfederal prison (Epstein was allowed to serve 13 months in the Palm Beach county jail), and now awaits \nan additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in Miami for transporting firearms, another deal he \nsays he made to pay the bills after he lost his job. \nIn a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have $2,000 \nin cash on hand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley \nRobson who brought them to the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions to the \nPalm Beach Police Department, and in return was given PBPD baseball hats to put on the dashboard of \nhis various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by local police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, \nin his own deposition, acknowledged that, in addition to earlier donations to the police department \n(which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given the department \n$100,000 for some sophisticated equipment. The police were still researching the purchase when Epstein \ncame under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the money returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein's local \nattorneys, told police that Epstein also gave $100,000 to the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was \n\"very passionate\" about massages being \"therapeutically and spiritually\" beneficial. Yet victims told \npolice they had no massage training.) \nPerhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein's relationship with Jean Luc \nBrunel, owner of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for \nthe Southern District of Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and \nMarcinkova \"deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children \nthrough MC2, mostly girls under the age of 17, to engage in sexual play for money.\" (Which would \namount to trafficking.) \nBrunel is a 50-plus French playboy who was formerly part owner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling \nagency. He lives in New York and South Beach, Florida, and owns 85 percent of MC2, which has offices \nin New York, Miami, and Tel Aviv. (The remaining 15 percent is owned by his partner, Jeff Fuller.) \nBrunel has been observed as a house guest at Epstein's Palm Beach home and may well have had contact \nwith him also in New York, where Epstein owns a lavish home, and in Paris, where Epstein keeps an \napartment on elegant Ave. Foch. \nCBS reporter Craig Pyes, who investigated Brunel for a 60 Minutes broadcast many years ago, is quoted \nin Michael Gross' book about the modeling industry, Model: The Ugly Business pfBeautiful Women. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022253 \nPyes told the author that Brunel \"ranks among the sleaziest people in the fashion industry. We're talking \nabout a conveyor belt, not a casting couch. Hundreds of girls were not only harassed but molested.\" Now \nThe Daily Beast has learned that Epstein had made a $1 million wire transfer to Brunel's offshore bank \naccount in September 2004, just as he was setting up MC2. Whether this was a gift or a loan or a \nbackdoor investment in the new venture is unknown. A French citizen who managed to avoid giving \nevidence in the Epstein investigation, Brunel declined to comment on any of this, as does Fuller. Asked \nin April of Brunel's activities, Epstein said \"I'm 100 percent convinced that he doesn't traffic children.\" \n(Brunel has never been charged.) \nAn American fashion designer who booked her girls through MC2 says they were very young and very \nbeautiful; many were from Eastern Europe and spoke little English. A former bookkeeper in the agency's \nMiami office, who also arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S., confirmed that MC2 girls became \nfrequent guests on Epstein's private jets. \nPilot logs obtained in the civil suits show that some of the named plaintiffs were on the flight manifests. \nOther times, the pilot would just list the other passengers plus \"female.\" \nPosted 02 August 2010 - 12:47 AM \nJeffrey Epstein, Jew Billionaire Pedophile, Child Trafficker Goes Free..WoW! 20 year old Hearsay is enough to destroy catholic priest.

Also: \n• Palm Beach's police chief objected to Epstein's \"special treatment\" and gave The Daily Beast an \nexclusive look at his nine-hour deposition about the investigation. \n• Earlier versions of the U.S attorney's charges, including a sealed 53-page indictment, could have landed \nEpstein in prison for 20 years. \n• Victims alleged that Epstein molested underage girls from South America, Europe, and the former \nSoviet republics, including three 12-year-old girls brought over from France as a birthday gift. \n• The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on Epstein's private jets, which would be \nevidence of sex trafficking—a much more serious federal crime than the state charges Epstein was \nconvicted of. \n• Epstein's attorneys investigated members of the Palm Beach Police Department, while others ordered \nprivate investigators to follow and intimidate the victims' families; one even posed as a police officer. \n• Then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told The Daily Beast that he \"would have instructed the \nJustice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022254 \nFilm director Roman Polanski is not the only convicted pedophile to walk free this month and return to a \nlife of privilege.

In the earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a \nminor-13 months in the Palm Beach Stockade—he was allowed out to his office each day. Meanwhile, \nEpstein has settled more than a dozen lawsuits brought by the underage girls who were recruited to \nperform \"massages\" at his Palm Beach mansion. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, \ndays before a scheduled trial; each received well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent \nEpstein's $2 billion net worth. \n• Conchita Sarnoff: Epstein Faces Sex Traffic Probe \n• The Billionaire Pedphile's Sex Den \nWith that, the known victims of Epstein's sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case \nagainst him is closed unless new ones come forward. According to banking sources, he has been moving \nassets out of the U.S. and may well follow Polanski into a luxurious exile. \nBut the question remains: Did Epstein's wealth and social connections—former President Bill Clinton; \nPrince Andrew; former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; and \nformer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers were just a few of the prominent passengers on his private \njets—allow him to receive only a slap on the wrist for crimes that carry a mandatory 20-year sentence? \nWas he able, with his limitless assets and heavy-hitting lawyers—Alan Dershowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, \nRoy Black, Kenneth Starr, Guy Lewis, and Martin Weinberger among them—to escape equal justice? \nEpstein Faces Sex-Traffic Probe \nhttp://www.thedailyb...obref=obnetwork  \nThe Justice Department is investigating Jeffrey Epstein for child trafficking, The Daily Beast has \nlearned—and has widened the scope of its probe to include a famous modeling agency. \nHedge-fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completed his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor last \nweek. But it appears his problems may not be over. Now The Daily Beast has learned that: \n• Federal investigators continue to investigate Epstein's activities, to see whether there is evidence of \nchild trafficking—a far more serious charge than the two in his non-prosecution agreement, the \narrangement between Epstein and the Department of Justice allowing him to plead guilty to lower-level \nstate crimes. Trafficking can carry a 20-year sentence. \n• The FBI is also investigating Epstein's friend Jean Luc Brunel, whose MC2 modeling agency appears \nto have been a source of girls from overseas who ended up on Epstein's private jets. \nBecause Epstein's predatory habits stretch back many years and involved dozens of young-looking girls, \nthere may well be more evidence to uncover. \nUnder the concept of double jeopardy, Epstein can no longer be prosecuted for any of the charges \ncovered by his non-prosecution agreement, in which he agreed to serve a short term of incarceration, \nfund the civil suits of named victims, and register as a sex offender. The victims who accepted cash \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022255 \nsettlements in these civil suits agreed not to testify against him or speak publicly about the case. \nHowever, new evidence developed by the Department of Justice on other offenses not covered by the \nagreement, including allegations by additional victims who come forward, could lead to new charges. \nThere is no statute of limitations in the federal sex-trafficking law, which was also enacted by the state of \nFlorida in 2002. Because his predatory habits stretch back many years and involved dozens of young-\nlooking girls, there may well be more evidence to uncover. (Several young women who claim to be \nEpstein victims have recently contacted a Ft. Lauderdale lawyer, but to date no new civil complaints \nhave been filed.) \n• Conchita Sarnoff: The Billionaire Pedphile's Sex Den \n• Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free \nThese new developments come one week after the publication of two articles in The Daily Beast about \nEpstein's pattern of sexual contact with underage girls, which Palm Beach police began investigating in \n2005 and the U.S. Attorney's office then settled in a 2007 plea deal. The first article quoted a deposition \nby then-Palm Beach Chief of Police Michael Reiter, in which he stated that Epstein, a billionaire with \nmany powerful friends, had received special treatment in both his plea deal and the terms of his \nincarceration. Although federal investigators at one point produced a draft 53-page indictment against \nEpstein, he was eventually allowed to plead guilty to only two relatively minor state charges and receive \na short term of incarceration: 13 months in the county jail, during which he went to the office every day, \nand one year of community control, during which he traveled frequently to New York and his private \nisland in the Virgin Islands. \nThe Daily Beast has now discovered another instance in which Epstein apparently received special \nconsideration: As a convicted sex offender, he is required by law to undergo an impartial psychological \nevaluation prior to sentencing and to receive psychiatric treatment during and after incarceration. This is \nbecause child molesters tend to be repeat offenders with high rates of recidivism. According to a source \nin law enforcement, however, Epstein was allowed to submit a report by his private psychologist, Dr. \nStephen Alexander of Palm Beach, Florida, whose phone has since been disconnected with no \nforwarding information. \nThe Daily Beast's second article provided details about Epstein's systematic abuse of underage girls at \nhis Palm Beach mansion, where members of his staff allegedly recruited and paid a parade of teenagers, \nmost of them 16 or younger, to perform daily massages that devolved into masturbation, groping, and \nsometimes full-blown sexual contact. It also revealed a monetary relationship between Epstein and Jean \nLuc Brunel, a frequent visitor to whom he gave $1 million around the same time that Brunel was starting \nhis MC2 modeling agency. Some of the young girls MC2 recruited from overseas—often from Eastern \nEurope and South America—are known to have been passengers on Epstein's private jets. \nThe U.S. Attorney General's Office in Florida says that it is against policy to confirm or deny the \nexistence of an investigation. Jeffrey Epstein's lawyer, Jack Goldberger, says he has no knowledge of an \nongoing probe, and he told The Daily Beast, \"Jeffrey Epstein has fully complied with all state and federal \nrequirements that arise from the prior proceedings in Palm Beach. There are no pending civil lawsuits. \nThere are not and should not be any pending criminal investigations, given Mr. Epstein's complete \nfulfillment of all the terms of his non-prosecution agreement with the federal government.\" \nConchita Sarnoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 500 companies and \nhas produced three current-events debate TV programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut to Kabul, and \na segment for The Oppenheimer Report.

Some of the cyclical\ndecline reversed as the economic recovery entered\nits eighth year: the participation rate has risen to\n62.7% as of November 2016.\n\nThe male labor force participation, however,\nhas been declining, coincidentally also by 0.3%\n\nExhibit 10: US Labor Force Participation Rate\nBoth cyclical and structural factors have contributed to a\ndecline in the participation rate from the 2000 peak.\n\n%\n70\n\n68 + 67.3\n66\n64 4\n62 62.7\n60 4\n58\n56 +\n54\n52 4\n\n50 +\n1950 1956 1962 1966 1974 1980 1986 1992 1998 2004 2010 2016\n\nData through November 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Datastream.\n\nper year—but since 1952.

Humans do not appear to have\nsuch a limitation and regularly extend their appreciation of mathematics\nby expanding the rules, and seeing through to the truth.\n\nMany scientists dislike this argument and think it farfetched, saying\nthere is no evidence to show people see past the limitation. Our brains\ncould be following a formal system capable of discovering everything we\nhave discovered to date or, indeed, might encounter in the future. Why\nshould we assume human minds are constrained in the same way as the\nmathematical systems they discover? There is no evidence to suggest a\nhuman thinking about Peano arithmetic is running a Peano based model\nin their head. When Peano discovered his theorem he was certainly\nextending our mathematical knowledge, but this does not imply he was\nextending the capability of his brain.\n\nThe critics of Lucas and Penrose have one big problem to deal with.\nThe formal system in our head would need to be able to see the truth in\neverything we could ever encounter. But, our formal system appears to\nbe small. As infants, it is almost nonexistent. Where does this enormous\nsystem come from? It can’t come from our parents because they have\nthe same problem; they were once children.

I think it's\nhelpful to have a range of voices who can give advice, if possible. There's nothing wrong\nwith trusting one person above others, but all humans have their blind spots, and mentors\nare human too. This is one thing I love about the BDSM community, by the way (or at\nleast, my experience with the BDSM communities I have been part of -- not all BDSM\ncommunities are the same...). In many BDSM communities, there are many cafe meetups\nand other low-pressure gatherings that make perfect environments for getting this kind of\nadvice!\n\n* Not all BDSM -- or porn -- or whatever! -- is the same. If you don't like (or are even\nrevolted by) something you see, then you can try watching (or reading, or talking about)\nsomething else. Me, I got really excited when I first learned about Comstock Films: Tony\nComstock makes documentaries that show real couples having real sex, and his\ndocumentaries are much more realistic and comfortably sexual than mainstream porn.\nAnd I really didn't like mainstream porn. But then I found that I wasn't that into\nComstock Films themselves, even though I love the idea so much that I screened one of\nthe movies at my sex-positive film series. So I concluded that I'm just not into porn at all,\nand that I'd be better off to focus on written erotica.\n\nBut then I finally saw some porn that turned me on at CineKink, \"the really alternative\nfilm festival\" -- and I hadn't even expected it to turn me on! I'd just been watching out of\nacademic interest! And these days, I find that I'm sometimes turned on by watching the\nmainstream porn I tried so hard to avoid in the first place. The moral of the story is\nobvious.\n\nThe bottom line is that mere exposure to new ideas about sexuality can bring personal\nsexual evolution -- and that's awesome. So if you're interested in facilitating your own\nsexual evolution, the first thing to do is learn about sexuality by whatever means possible.\n\nte Kk ok\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\n\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2010/05/28/sexual-openness-2-ways-to-encourage-it/\n\nRELATIONSHIPS:\n[storytime] Fear, Loathing, and S&M Sluthood in San Francisco\n\nI originally wrote this and published it at OffOurChests.com in late 2010.

His work would have been\nimpossible without powerful computers. The Internet made his own work a lot easier\nand, he notes, acted as a leveler internationally: “When I grew up in India, if you wanted\nto get a book, it would show up six months or a year after it had already come out in the\nWest. ... Journals would arrive by surface mail a few months later. I didn’t have to\ndeal with it, because I left India when I was nineteen, but I know Indian scientists had to\ndeal with it. Today they have access to information at the click of a button. More\nimportant, they have access to lectures. They can listen to Richard Feynman. That\nwould have been a dream of mine when I was growing up. They can just watch Richard\nFeynman on the Web. That’s a big leveling in the field.” And yet... “Along with the\nbenefits [of the Web], there is now a huge amount of noise. You have all of these people\nspouting pseudoscientific jargon and pushing their own ideas as if they were science.”\n\nAs president of the Royal Society, Venki worries, too, about the broader issue of\ntrust: public trust in evidence-based scientific findings, but also trust among scientists,\nbolstered by rigorous checking of one another ’s conclusions—trust that is in danger of\neroding because of the “black box” character of deep-learning computers. “This\n[erosion] is going to happen more and more, as data sets get bigger, as we have genome-\nwide studies, population studies, and all sorts of things,” he says. “How do we, as a\nscience community, grapple with this and communicate to the public a sense of what\nscience is about, what is reliable in science, what is uncertain in science, and what is just\nplain wrong in science?”\n\n127\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016347\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}
