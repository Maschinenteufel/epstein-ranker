We need to understand the role of denial. We need to understand how individuals and groups\ndehumanize the other and self-deceive themselves into believing that those unlike them represent a threat\nto their purity and power. We need to understand how desire and denial combine to pave the way to\n\nexcessive harms.\n\nHauser Chapter 2.

Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253, 78\n§.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1288 (1958)).\n\n[52] For purposes of the minimum con-\ntacts inquiry, a distinction is made be-\ntween specific and general jurisdiction.\nSpecific jurisdiction exists when the forum\nexercises jurisdiction over the defendant in\na suit arising out of the defendant’s con-\ntacts with that forum. Metro. Life Ins. 84\nF.3d at 567-68.

Reasonableness\n\n[53] In determining whether the exer-\ncise of personal jurisdiction is reasonable,\na court is to consider:\n\n(1) the burden that the exercise of juris-\n\ndiction will impose on the defendant; (2)\n\nthe interests in the forum state in adju-\n\ndicating the case; ©) the plaintiffs in-\nterest in obtaining convenient and effec-\ntive relief; (4) the interstate judicial\nsystem’s interest in obtaining the most\nefficient resolution of the controversy;\nand (5) the shared interest of the states\nin furthering substantive social policies.\n\nMetro.

In addition to being more\nnaturally outgoing than my father, she came to see Mishmar Hasharon has her\nextended family and spent every one of her one hundred years there.\n\nEsther Godin, as the then was, grew up in Warsaw. Born in 1913, she was\nthe oldest of the six children of Samuel and Rachel Godin. Poland at the time\nwas home to the largest Jewish community in the world, more than 3 million by\nthe time of the Holocaust. While the Jews of Poland had a long history, the\nGodins did not. Before the First World War, my mother’s parents made their\nway from Smolensk in Russia to Warsaw, which was also under czarist rule.\nWhen the war was over, the Bolshevik Revolution had toppled the czars. Poland\nbecame independent, under the nationalist general Josef Pilsuldski. The Godins\nhad a decision to make: either return to now-Communist Russia or stay in the\nnew Polish state, though without citizenship because they had not been born\nthere. No doubt finding comfort, community and a sense of safety amid the\nhundreds of thousands of Jews in the Polish capital, they chose Pilsuldski over\nLenin. They lived in what would become the Warsaw Ghetto, on Nalewski\nStreet, where Samuel Godin eked out a living as a bookbinder.\n\nMy mother came to Zionism as a teenager, and it was easy to understand\nwhy she, like so many of the other young Jews around her, was drawn to it. She\nsaw how hard her parents were struggling economically, on the refugee fringes\nof a Jewish community itself precariously placed in a newly assertive Poland.\nShe saw no future for herself there. Though she attended a normal state-run high\nschool, she and her closest friends joined a Zionist youth group called Gordonia,\nwhich had been founded in Poland barely a decade earlier. She started studying\nHebrew. Each summer, from the age of 13, she and her Gordonia friends would\nspend deep in the Carpathian Mountains. They worked for local Polish\nlandowners, learning the rudiments of how to farm and the rigors of simple\nphysical labor. Late into the evening, they would learn not just about agriculture\nbut Jewish history, the land of Palestine, and how they hoped to put both their\nnew-found skills and the Zionist ideals into practice.\n\nShe had just turned 22 when she set off for Mishmar Hasharon with 60 other\nGordonia pioneers in the summer of 1935. It took them nearly a week to get\nthere. They travelled by train south through Poland, passing not far from the\nlittle town of OSwiecim which would later become infamous as the site of the\nAuschwitz concentration camp. Then, on through Hungary and across Romania\n\n19\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027867\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

When we got old\nenough, we took turns playing a short piece — the secular, kibbutz equivalent of\nan opening prayer — at the Friday-night meal in the dining hall. I have always\ncherished being able to play. Sitting down at the piano and immersing myself in\nTchaikovsky, Beethoven, Schubert or Mozart never ceases to bring me a sense\nof calm, freedom and, especially nowadays, when I have finally worked to\nmaster a particularly intricate piece, a feeling of pure joy.\n\nAs a young child, I spent most of my waking hours in the company of my\nseveral dozen kibbutz “siblings” in the children’s home, the dining hall, or\nrunning through the open spaces in the center of the kibbutz with our metapelet.\nShe would often take us through the orange groves in the afternoon, and\nsometimes across the main road to the Arab village.\n\nWadi Khawaret consisted of a few dozen concrete homes built back from a\nmain street bordered by shops and storehouses.

We saw cattle,\nbulls, even the odd buffalo, being led to or from the fields. I sensed no hostility,\nand certainly no hatred, toward us in the village. The people seemed warm, and\nbenignly indifferent to the dozen Jewish toddlers and their metapelet. My own\nattitude to Wadi Khawaret was of benign curiosity. I did not imagine that within\na couple of years we would be on opposite sides of a war. I enjoyed these visits,\nas I enjoyed every part of my early childhood. Each age-group on the kibbutz\nwas given a name. Ours was called dror. It was the Hebrew word for\n“freedom”.\n\nBut dror was also the name of one of the Jewish youth movements in the\nWarsaw Ghetto, heroes in their doomed uprising against the Nazis.

An American writer, well known for his extreme views,\nwas so keen to project Dubai’s alleged “failure” in the coexistence of cultures, that he went all the way stating\n\nthat Dubai was a place where cultures break up and not where cultures meet. He reached that conclusion based\non the fact that Dubai has jailed and deported a British couple caught having illegal sex on a public beach.\n\nWith regard to the fact that the global crisis effect threatens Dubai’s growth and economy, I can guarantee you\nthat those references constitute \"wishful thinking\" on the part of some people; they are illusions, not realities.\nThe economic foundations and development are firm and stable; otherwise Dubai would not have been able to\ndeal efficiently with the global financial crisis consequences.

It generated a state of panic in all\ndeveloped economies. It was expected that our region would not be immune to the crisis, especially in view of\nthe fact that it led to the credit freeze, write-downs at banks, deferral of mutual credits, and a freeze on lending\nin some of the wealthiest industrialized countries, such as the United States.\n\nThe crisis hit the world in September 2008, but I think that the panic pha se is over now, especially after the\nintervention of governments in many major countries to regulate financial and banking sectors, and the\nallocation of large sums of money to revitalize their economies. This step has enabled the summit of the G20\nthat was held in London a few days ago, to agree on a package of decisions and actions aimed to revive the\nglobal economy and the organization of the international markets.\n\nFor us in the United Arab Emirates, I can safely say that we have succeeded in containing the risks of the global\nfinancial crisis in record time. This is a result of the good policies of the Central Bank, and the government's\naction to ensure the liquidity of banks and the protection of deposits, and other actions at the local level, such as\nthe additional liquidity that the Abu Dhabi government pumped it into the Emirate’s banks and the bond\nissuance of $20 billion bonds.\n\nThe crisis management in addition to the decisions taken during the G20 summit have spread a high degree of\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024933\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The earthquake that reached\na magnitude of 7.0 on the Richter scale and demolished the capital of Haiti in 2010 took the lives of\napproximately 200,000 people, all innocent and undeserving of this natural disaster. This is excess\nbeyond what any psychopath has ever achieved. The Spanish Flu found its way into the bodies of\ninnocent people from the Arctic to the Pacific Islands from 1918 to 1920, and killed over 50 million\npeople — a death toll that is at least four times higher than what Hitler caused during his reign, and\ncomparable to that achieved by Mao Ze-Dong during his. As noted in chapter 1, chimpanzees kill at a\nrate that approximates many hunter-gatherer groups. When they kill, the frenzied attacks are over the top,\ninvolving gruesome dismemberment of their victims by biting into the face, ripping off testicles and\ndislocating limbs. By the age of 15 years, Willie James Bosket Jr had committed some 200 armed\nrobberies, stabbed 25 innocent victims, kicked a boy off of a roof to his death, and killed two men\nfollowing a failed robbery, all “for the experience.” At the level of outcomes, these are all horrific cases\nof lives lost, with some excessive in terms of numbers and others in terms of means.\n\nWe can eliminate earthquakes and other natural disasters from the list of evildoers by noting that\nthey don’t have, as their goal or as a foreseen consequence, the elimination of lives, innocent or not. They\ndon’t have goals at all. This also eliminates them from the class of victims, assuming the day comes when\nscientists can kill off earthquakes, cyclones, hurricanes, blizzards and so on before they pick up enough\nsteam to cause great harm. One might think that viruses, and their virulent partners the parasites, lack\ngoals because they lack brains. This intuition is correct anatomically, but incorrect conceptually. As the\nAmerican philosopher Daniel Dennett has noted, the beauty of Darwin’s theory of natural selection is that\nit provided a way of giving nature competence without comprehension. Thus, viruses and parasites have\ngoals without understanding at all. To survive and reproduce, they have evolved exquisite chemical and\nelectrical machines that harvest all of their host’s resources. And if making a living requires killing the\nhost, so be it. They do so without shedding a tear. No guilt, no remorse. Chimpanzees, on the other hand,\nhave goals and brains that represent them. When chimpanzees kill, their goal is not food. Their brutal\nattacks are motivated by a desire to outcompete their rivals and absorb additional resources; no one\nknows if they feel guilt or remorse. Willie Bosket’s goal was to rob two men, but when he failed, he\nturned to gratuitous violence, for the experience. Bosket certainly could, as a human, feel guilt and\nremorse, but all reports indicate he didn’t.\n\nWe can eliminate parasites and viruses from the list of evildoers and evilreceivers by noting that\nthey lack an understanding of right and wrong, and are incapable of suffering. Chimpanzees are a harder\ncase. They live in societies with norms and respond aggressively to norm transgressions, as occurs when a\n\nhigh ranking male beats a lower ranking male for trying to steal food or a mating opportunity.\n\nHauser Chapter 3.

This tracking could all be done by the NSA.\nWhat the U.S. lacked was any practical means to capture a high-profile intelligence defector in a\ncity that was part of China. By this time, US intelligence had established that Chinese and Hong\nKong security services were monitoring Snowden’s every move. This left few options in the\ngame for the U.S. “I’m not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker,” President\nObama said on June 27, 2013.\n\nThe real prize, in any case, was not Snowden himself but the NSA’s secrets documents that he\nhad with him in Hong Kong. When Snowden was observed entering the Russian consulate, the\ngame was all but over. US diplomats could protest over back channels to Moscow, as they did,\nbut, with a trove of NSA secrets at stake, there was little expectation that they stop the Russians.\nTwo days later, the ’single point of failure,” as Snowden described himself, was on his way to\nRussia, where he would be subject to Moscow’s rules.\n\nWhen a victory is obtained in a major sports event, such as the world cup, it is celebrated with\nvictory dances, parties and ticker-tape parades. The opposite is true in the Game of Nation. An\nintelligence victory involving secret documents, even if it cannot be entirely hidden, is kept veiled,\nas far as is possible, to increase the value of the coup. “The final move in any sophisticated\nintelligence game,” Angleton told me in relation to espionage intelligence coup, is “obscuring a\nsuccess.”\n\nFollowing Angleton’s precept the Russian or Chinese intelligence services, if they had a role in\nacquiring the product of the self-described “single point of failure,” would work to cover their\ntracks in the affair even before the Aeroflot plane carrying Snowden touched down at\nSheremetyevo International Airport on June 23, 2013. If any false flag operations had been used\nto trick, mislead, or otherwise induce Snowden to come to Hong Kong, they would be disbanded.\nIf any safe housed had been used to quarter Snowden in his first 11 days in Hong Kong, they\nwould be shut down. If any operatives had been used in Hawaii to guide or assist Snowden, they\nwould be put back into the sleep mode. If any tell-tale traces had been left in chat rooms or social\nmedia, they would be systematically deleted. Even more important to the ultimate success of\nsuch a communications intelligence coup, measures would be taken to conceal the extent of the\ndamage done by the “single point of failure” by not precipitously closing down compromised\nsources. Snowden might believe that the power of the information he held was so great that, if\ndisclosed by him, all the NSA’s sources would immediately go dark in Russia and China, but\nRussia might not wish to provide such clarity to its adversaries. An intelligence service need not\nclose down channels it discovers are compromised by an adversary. Instead it can elect to\ncontinue to use them and furnish through them bits of sensitive information to advance its own\nnational interest. The real danger here was not that the NSA’s “lights” would dramatically be\nextinguished but that all the future messages illuminated by those lights would be less reliable\nsources of intelligence. The Game of Nations 1s, after all, merely a competition among\nadversaries to gain advantages by the surreptitious exchange of both twisted and straight\ninformation. When the NSA asserted in the summer of 2013 that over one million documents, it\nwas recognizing the most massive failure in its 60 year history. Not only NSA secrets, but secret\nfiles from the CIA, the British GCHQ, and America’s cyber military commands, had been\ncompromised.

Instead, for thirteen days in Hong Kong she worked\nthrough intermediaries. Her task was not only to arrange Snowden’s\nescape route but also to create diversions to camouflage his real des-\ntination. Under Assange’s tutelage, she had made deceptive ploys an\nintegral part of her tradecraft. “We were working very hard to lay as\nmany false trails as possible,” she later told an interviewer in Berlin.\n\nAccording to Assange, she booked decoy flights for Snowden to\nBeijing and New Delhi. She also used Snowden’s credit card number\nto pay for the flight to India; because the card was blocked, she knew\nthere was a high probability that it would come to the attention of\nUSS. intelligence.

I personally thought it was a great match \nfor your business needs in Qatar. If for any reason your decision was based on crew issues and charter needs in the Middle East, \nI'd like to share some information that might prove beneficial to making you reconsider this purchase. \nThe pilot candidates I have lined up for your interview along with the possibility of David Rodgers joining your flight department \nwere as follows: \n(at no time did I disclose location or persons to the following pilot candidates to protect your privacy.) \nRobert Breslin, who is the former Chief Pilot of Mr. Donald Trump, Mr. Breslin flew the Boeing 727 and Boeing 757 owned by Mr \nTrump.

I believe the large business jet future in Qatar is growing and you will be \nleading its path, and your initial investment in this purchase will not come close with other aircraft options on the market as you \nmay have seen already. \nWe are currently completing the C2C check on the Boeing, and as we have done in the past, assure you it will be a fine aircraft \nwhen it leaves Flight Star Maintenance repair facility. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027097 \nSincerely, \nLawrance Visoski \nChief Pilot, JEGE Inc. \n= \n--\n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

According to Rajesh De, just assembling\nthese reports involved thousands of hours of manpower. In addition, the President’s Oversight\nBoard required that NSA’s Office of the General Counsel and Inspector General supply it every\n90 days with a list of every single error made by every NSA employee anywhere in the world\ndeviating from procedures, including even minor typing errors. These requirements, according to\nDe, inundated a large part of the NSA legal and executive staff in a sea of red tape. Yet, this\nregulation could not undo surveillance programs such as the one Snowden revealed of Verizon\nturning over the billing records of its custumers to the NSA, because the NSA was in compliance\nwith the FISA court order (even though, as it turned out in 2015, the FISA court may have erred\nin interpreting the law.)\n\nThe NSA’s focus on surveillance may have led to the neglect of its second mission: protecting the\nintegrity of the channels through which the White House, government agencies and military units send\ninformation. This task had been made vastly more difficult by the proliferation of computer networks,\ntexting and emails in the 21* century. To protect against cyber attacks against government networks, the\nPentagon belatedly created the Cyber Command in 2009. In it, the cyber defense units of the Army, Navy,\nMarines, and Air Force cyber forces, were merged together in this new command put under the command\nof the NSA director. NSA director Keith Alexander became the first director of this new command. One\nproblem for the Cyber command was separating attacks by civilians, including criminals, hacktavists and\nanarchists, from cyber warfare sponsored and supported by adversary states. Since foreign intelligence\nservices often closely imitated the tools of civilian hackers, and were even known to provide them with\nhacking tools. Even for the Cyber Command, it was not easy challenge to unambiguously determine if the\nultimate perpetrator of a cyber attacks was state-sponsored. For example, the identification of North Korea\nas the principal actor behind the attack on Sony in December 2014 appeared to be a rare success, but many\ncyber-security experts believed that it might be a false trail used to hide the real attacker. The problem\nhere was that clues can be fabricated in cyber space to point to the wrong party.\n\nThe job of the Cyber command was to prevent such an attack. To this end, it planted viruses on\nhundreds of thousands of computers in private hands to act as sentinels to spot other suspicious viruses that\ncould mount such an attack. So private computers became a new battleground in the cyber was. It also\nbuilt a capability to retaliate. The problem was that, unlike incoming missiles, cyber attacks which were\nlaunched through layers of other country’s computers could not be unambiguously traced back to the true\nperpetrator.\n\nThis escalation by the Cyber Command set the stage for expanded forms of warfare in Cyber space.\n“The Chinese are viewed as the source of a great many attacks on western infrastructure and just recently,\nthe U.S. electrical grid,” General Alexander said in explaining the need for this consolidation. “If that is\ndetermined to be an organized attack, I would want to go and take down the source of those attacks.” The\nsame retaliation would presumably be used against Russia, Iran or any other adversary. Dominance of\ncyber space itself now became part of the NSA’s mandate.\n\nEven so, the most important job of the NSA remained intercepting secret information from\nRussia, China, Iran, and North Korea. To this end, it had an annual budget of $12.3 billion and\nsome 35,000 military and civilian employees.

But we\nstill had to avoid trouble on our way back out.

As we got closer,\nwe could hear gunfire. Obviously, the police, and the Palestinian militias,\nrealized something was not right. The advantage we had was that they would\nhave no idea what had happened on Rue Verdun, who we were, or where we\nwere going.\n\nNo sooner had we joined the Corniche than I saw another police Land Rover\nabout 200 yards ahead of us. This one had a spotlight on the roof, panning both\nsides of the road. I told the driver to slow down. About 100 yards or so later,\nreaching the place where we’d arranged for the SEALs to meet us, he and the\nother station wagon pulled over to the side of the road. The Land Rover kept\ndriving. We slid down a steep embankment nearly 30 feet to the sea. Two of the\nthree assault teams had bags full of documents as well. We swam out to the\ndinghies. When we had hoisted ourselves in, we headed out at first by paddle,\nthen under engine power, to the missile boat. The whole operation had taken\nabout a half an hour, only 10 minutes on Rue Verdun.\n\nI radioed Manno on the way to the missile boat. A half-dozen words: the\nagreed code phrase for “mission accomplished, targets achieved.” I could hear\nrelief in his voice when he replied. At first, | assumed that was because they\nhadn’t heard from us during the operation. Our radio link to the missile boat had\ngone down when we entered the built-up area around the apartment blocks.\nGenuinely, despite Manno’s suspicion that I’d cut the connection. Yet he had\nother reasons to exhale when he heard we had got out safely. Amnon’s team had\nhad a much tougher time. They met resistance from the moment they arrived at\nthe DFLP building. Two of his men were killed, another wounded. They set off\ntheir explosive charges, but had to fight their way out. They only barely\nmanaged to escape, carrying their fallen comrades with them and linking up\nwith another team of SEALs near the Coral Beach.\n\nIt was a little before six in the morning when I got home. I was careful not to\nwake Nava. I’d changed out of my slacks and flats and surrendered my wig on\nthe missile boat. But I didn’t have the energy to deal with my makeup. The next\nthing I remember was my wife standing by our bed as I stirred awake around\nnoon the next day. She looked at my eye makeup and lipstick, shook her head,\nand smiled.

Rev. 861, *940\n\nBased on this legislative history, Kenna concluded that crime victims have the right to speak at CVRA-covered proceedings.\n445 Kenna explained that this interpretation advanced the purposes of the CVRA, for the \"statute was enacted to [*941] make\ncrime victims full participants in the criminal justice system.\". 4° The Advisory Committee should follow that lead and\nprovide that victims are guaranteed a right to speak at sentencing. *47 Of course, in cases involving numerous victims (for\n\nexample, a massive fraud case), the CVRA itself allows courts to fashion a \"reasonable procedure” to accommodate the\n\ncompeting concerns. #48\n\nRule 44.1 - Discretionary Appointment of Counsel for Victim The Proposals:\nI proposed that the court's discretionary authority to appoimt counsel for a victim should be included in a new rule as follows:\nRule 44.1 Counsel for Victims.\n\nWhen the interests of justice require, the court may appoint counsel for a victim to assist the victim in exercising his or her\n\nrights. “49\n\nThe Advisory Committee did not propose any change in the Rules on this subject. 4°\nDiscussion:\n\nThe Advisory Committee never discussed this particular proposed change, so it is possible that its failure to adopt it was an\noversight. +5! In any event, here it is perhaps useful to emphasize just a few points in favor of this proposal.\n\nWhile the CVRA does not create a right to counsel for victims, nothing in the Act deprived the courts of their preexisting\ninherent authority. The courts generally have the right to appoint volunteer counsel in civil cases, *** a power that would seem\nto extend to criminal cases. Indeed, the Supreme Court has left open the question of whether federal courts possess the inherent\nauthority to require counsel [*942] to provide legal services to the poor. ** The local rules of some federal courts already\nexplicitly recognize this power. *>4 In addition, Title 28 broadly permits the court in both civil and criminal cases to \"request\nan attorney to represent any person unable to afford counsel.\" 49° And before Gideon v. Wainwright, *°° courts could request\n\n45 Td.\n46 Td.\n\n47 Tn possible response to such concerns as I raise here, the Advisory Committee modified the Advisory Committee Note to this rule.

Many states follow a similar approach and give victims access to presentence reports as part of the victim-impact\nprocess. 404\n\nSince I made my proposal, the Ninth Circuit has considered the question of whether to reverse a district court that declined to\nprovide the entire presentence report to a fraud victim. In an opinion containing only one substantive paragraph, the Ninth\nCircuit affirmed the district court, which had rejected a victim's argument that \"the CVRA confers a general right for crime\nvictims to obtain [*933] disclosure of the [presentence report].\" 405 The Ninth Circuit stated tersely that the district court did\nnot \"commit legal error.\" 40°\n\nAlthough strong arguments can be made against Kenna, 4°” the case is not on point to my proposal. First, Kenna involved a\nclaim of a \"general right\" to access to the presentence report, apparently untethered to any particular need for access. My\namendment would be limited to situations where victims seek \"relevant\" contents of the presentence report to make a victim\nimpact statement at sentencing. Second, the victim in Kenna sought the entire presentence report. The Ninth Circuit pointedly\nobserved: \"We note that Kenna refused the district court's offer to consider disclosure of specific portions of the [presentence\nreport].\" 4°8 My proposal tracks what the district court offered to Kenna - that a victim would have access to \"relevant contents\nof the presentence report.\"\n\nBecause victims have a right of access to relevant parts of the presentence report, the question then arises of how to provide\nthat access. In my earlier article, I recommended the simplest solution to the competing concerns would be to disclose the\nreport, upon request, to victims through the prosecutor. The prosecutor could filter out irrelevant confidential information and\nassist the victim by highlighting critical parts of the report.

Crow called the lawsuit “vague.\n“You have to know, at this point in time, what he did or didn’t do that was an abuse of process,” Crow said.\nEpstein, 58, has confidentially settled more than two dozen lawsuits with young women who allege they were sexually\nabused by him when they were minors.\nEdwards filed a counterclaim, alleging Epstein filed the lawsuit to get Edwards to back down from representing the\nvictims.\n“Mr. Epstein had to pay more to settle these cases than he would have if Mr. Edwards wasn’t out there putting all this\npressure on him,” said attorney Jack Scarola, who represents Edwards. “That’s Mr. Edwards’ job ... to put as much\nlegitimate pressure on the defendant as he possibly could and he obviously did an extremely effective job.”\nEpstein pleaded guilty to two felony charges: soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor for prostitution. He served 13\nmonths in the county jail and has to register as a lifelong sex offender.\nRepresenting Epstein, attorney Joseph Ackerman argued unsuccessfully for a gag order. Ackerman said Scarola has\nrepeatedly made statements to several news organizations about the case.\n“Mr. Scarola has constantly referred to Mr. Epstein as a pedophile and there’s been no proof of that anywhere,”\nAckerman said. “Muzzling lawyers who may wish to make public statements has been long recognized as within the\ncourt’s inherent power ... We don’t believe it’s appropriate to wage a media campaign and taint the jury pool.”\nScarola said it would be unconstitutional to impose a gag order.\n“There is a complete and total absence of proof that we have engaged in any conduct whatsoever that could be\nprohibited,” Scarola said.\nScarola said he and Edwards have been asked to appear on national television as well as received interview requests\nfrom the foreign press. Scarola said he has been selective in his interviews.\nThere has been a frenzy in the British press ever since Virginia Roberts, an Epstein victim, spoke to the Sunday Daily\nMail earlier this year about being introduced to Prince Andrew and spending time with him at Epstein’s behest. Roberts\nalleged she served as a sex slave to Epstein when she was a minor.\n“If Mr. Epstein is embarrassed by Mr. Epstein’s conduct, that’s Mr. Epstein’s problem,” Scarola said.\n“I’m pleased to hear he’s embarrassed by his conduct. Maybe it will serve as some deterrent in the future.”\nFind this article at:\nhttp://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/judge-denies-gag-order-in-epstein-edwards-lawsuit-1606397.html\nPrint this page\nClose\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Under these complex rules, partnership debt is generally allocated to the\npartner or partners, if any, that bear the ultimate “economic risk of loss” for the debt. For\nexample, where a partnership debt is guaranteed by a partner, that partner generally would be\nallocated the debt's entire associated tax basis. In determining which partner bears the economic\nrisk of loss, the rules provide a general assumption that a partner is financially able to perform\nunder any guarantee agreement irrespective of the partner's actual net worth, unless the facts\nand circumstances indicate a plan to circumvent or avoid the obligation. =* As a result, tax\nplanners were able to insert virtually valueless DREs as guarantors of partnership debt to secure\nthe associated debt basis for use by the ultimate owners of the entities.\n\nFinal regulations published on 10/11/06 significantly modified this approach for all partners\nholding partnership interests through a DRE. == Under Reg. 1.752-2(k)(1), where a partner holds\nhis partnership interest through a DRE, the DRE's obligations are taken into account when\ndetermining the partner's economic risk of loss for the partnership-level liability only to the\nextent of the net value of the DRE as of the date on which the partnership determines the\npartner's share of partnership liabilities. 22 In the event that one or more DREs have payment\nobligations with respect to one or more liabilities of a partnership, the partnership must allocate\nthe net value of each DRE among the liabilities in a reasonable and consistent manner, taking\ninto account the relative priorities of those liabilities. °7\n\nThis special treatment of DREs in this context has been criticized by some commentators in that\nit uniquely singles out DREs when, in fact, any pass-through entity that limits the liability of its\nowners can be used to accomplish similar results without a similar net value limitation. 22\nNonetheless, the special treatment exists and represents another danger in simply ignoring a\nDRE as nonexistent during the course of tax planning.\n\nState Tax Treatment of DREs.\n\nDespite the fact that almost every state generally respects the federal classification of an SMLLC\nas a DRE for income tax purposes, several states impose an entity-level tax or fee on LLCs,\nincluding SMLLCs. °° The types of taxes or fees imposed, and the SMLLCs subject to the tax, vary\nwidely from state-to-state. Practitioners should inquire into a state's entity-level tax on SMLLCs,\nand possibly other DREs, before proceeding with planning opportunities in that state.\n\nUnlike the general conformity with federal law classification for income tax purposes, most states\ntreat LLCs, including SMLLCs, as separate legal entities with respect to registration fees, sales\nand use taxes, employment taxes, and property taxes. As a result, LLCs are generally subject to\nliability for these taxes and fees. Additionally, most states require an SMLLC to file its own\nseparate sales and use tax return, notwithstanding the fact that for state income tax purposes\nthe SMLLC is disregarded. °° On the other hand, many states allow an SMLLC and its owner to\nelect to file a consolidated sales and use tax return, if certain conditions are met. %\nConsequently, practitioners should analyze a DRE's tax and filing obligations state by state, so\nthat they can fully apprise their clients of all potential taxes and fees a particular state may\nimpose,\n\nGrantor Trust Considerations\n\nAs mentioned briefly above, opinions differ as to whether a wholly grantor trust is considered a\ndisregarded entity. In Rothstein, © the Second Circuit Court of Appeals implicitly held that a\nwholly grantor trust was not disregarded for all income tax purposes, because the grantor\nreceived a cost basis for assets purchased from the trust.

Rul. 85-13, 1985-1 CB 184,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026589\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In some rare instances China has used private citizens\nand/or companies to exploit loopholes in US regulations that prohibit direct foreign\ncontributions to elections.\n\ne On university campuses, Confucius Institutes (CIs) provide the Chinese government\naccess to US student bodies. Because CIs have had positive value in exposing students\nand communities to Chinese language and culture, the report does not generally oppose\nthem. But it does recommend that more rigorous university oversight and standards\nof academic freedom and transparency be exercised over CIs.

It’s not a\nproblem.” I figured there were at most four or five Lebanese soldiers manning\nthe checkpoint. The last thing they’d want to do is get involved in a firefight\nbetween us and the Syrians. But Motta’s reply was unequivocal. The mission\nwas off.\n\nWhen we’d climbed through a bramble-filled ravine back into Israel, I left a\nmessage for Motta. I found it hard to disguise my frustration, and my anger, at\nbeing ordered to abort the attack, especially after my assurances that the\nLebanese roadblock was not a problem. Yet when we got back to the sayeret\nbase, I realized there was more to his veto than I’d thought. He and Dado had\nreceived intelligence saying the Syrians were likely to make a series of further\ninspection tours of the border area, so this would not be our last chance. The\nnext day, we received word they’d be touring the western part of the border on\nJune 13. On the Lebanese side, it was known as Ras Naqoura, on ours as Rosh\nHanirkra, where the Mediterranean coastline rose dramatically to a ridge and,\nonce into Israel, sloped steeply down again toward Haifa.\n\nI took in two main assault teams, one led by Mookie, the other by Uzi\nDayan. We hid in a tangle of bushes about halfway along the road which\nclimbed up toward the border ridge. I stationed Bibi and his team at the bottom\nof the road, equipped with Uzis and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. We\nwaited, knowing that we’d be able to see the convoy as it twisted its way up\ntoward us. Again, I had no direct link to Motta. Yet both he and Dado were\nfollowing the mission from a command post in northern Israel. We were in\nnearly real-time contact through a sayeret officer, named Amit Ben-Horn, right\nacross the border.\n\nA first vehicle appeared at around 10:30 in the morning. Bibi radioed us. It\nwas a Lebanese army armored car with a single machine-gun. It drove past and\nhalted 150 feet on, at the point where the road began to climb. The two guys\ninside took out a small table and a couple of chairs and began brewing up coffee\non the side of the road. “All OK,” I said when I radioed Amit to tell him. “Pre-\ndeployment.” The convoy arrived two hours later and began to climb. “We’re\ntaking it,” I radioed Amit.\n\n“Wait,” he replied. And as I kept pressing him for the final go-ahead, another\n30 seconds passed.\n\n“Not approved,” he finally barked back at me, clearly wanting to make sure I\ngot the message.\n\n129\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011600\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Thanks for agreeing to have this discussion. \nRegards, \nMike \nPalm Beach Post Editorial #1 \nHe was over 50. And they were girls \nBy Elisa Cramer \nHASH(Ox5fa474) \nFriday, August 04, 2006 \nIf the women whom Palm Beach police say a part-time town resident invited to his home \nand paid for sex acts were, in fact, women, the solicitation charge against Jeffrey Epstein \nmight feel more sufficient. But, according to police records, they weren't. He was over \n50. And they were girls. 14. 15.16.17-year-old girls. That should count for something - \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030299 \nthe difference between prostitution and pedophilia. \nSo, it is baffling that Mr. Epstein, who was indicted last month by a grand jury on one \nfelony count of solicitation of prostitution, has not been charged, as Palm Beach police \nstrenuously urged, with unlawful sex acts with a minor and lewd and lascivious \nmolestation. \nConviction of crimes against minors would mean steeper penalties than the maximum \nfive-year prison term Mr. Epstein faces if convicted of the single count of felony \nsolicitation. It also would help carry a message of intolerance to perverts who prey on \ngirls. \nProsecutors did not pursue charges against Mr. Epstein reflecting the age of the victims \nbecause they assumed a jury would view the girls not as victims but as promiscuous, \nuntrustworthy, willing participants. The presumption is offensive. \nMr. Epstein, a 53-year-old Manhattan money manager who has hired Harvard law \nprofessor Alan Dershowitz and defense attorney Jack Goldberger, has denied knowing \nhow old the girls were. But police interviews with five alleged victims and 17 witnesses \nunder oath, as well as phone messages, a high school transcript and other items that \npolice found from searching Mr. Epstein's trash and 7,234-square-foot waterfront home, \nprovide evidence that he knew the girls were teenagers. \nOne girl couldn't show up when Mr. Epstein wanted because she had soccer. Another \ntime, Mr. Epstein had to wait for his \"massage\" session because the girl he wanted was \nstill in class. \nWhy didn't State Attorney Barry Krischer let a jury decide whether to believe the \nteenagers - including a 16-year-old who went to Mr. Epstein's house to \"work\" in \nDecember 2004 after being asked whether she needed to make money for Christmas \ngifts? \nProsecutors gave greater weight to the details Mr. Dershowitz provided about the girls in \nan apparent effort to assail their character. Mr. Dershowitz pointed out to prosecutors that \nsome of the teenagers had talked on myspace.com about marijuana and alcohol use. \nThe 20-year-old Royal Palm Beach woman who told police she recruited girls for Mr. \nEpstein has a Web page on myspace.com that features one girl using the name \"Pimpin' \nMade EZ.\" \nAlthough no charges of witness tampering have been filed, the parents of at least one of \nthe teenage victims complained to police of being followed and intimidated by two men. \nPolice determined that their vehicles were registered to two private investigators. Mr. \nGoldberger denied knowing anything about it. \nPolice also note in their reports that the state attorneys office offered Mr. Epstein a plea \ndeal that would have placed him on probation for five years, allowing him ultimately to \nwalk away with no criminal record at all. \nI asked Mr. Krischer's spokesman, Mike Edmondson, why the case was referred to a \ngrand jury instead of Mr. Epstein being charged and facing a trial before a jury. And \nshouldn't the victims credibility be a factor to determine whether a crime's been \ncommitted, not whether a jury will convict? (After all, as Mr. Goldberger told The Palm \nBeach Post of Mr. Epstein, \"He's never denied girls came to the house.\") \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030300 \nEspecially, I asked Mr. Edmondson to explain: Why shouldn't the public look at this case \nand think there are two kinds of justice - one for the wealthy and one for the rest of us? \nMr. Edmondson said he could not comment on the case because it is active, but on the \nlatter point, he offered, for the sake of \"philosophical debate\": \"Whether wealth buys a \ndifferent standard of justice across the country ... the answer to that would, of course, be \nyes.\" \nBut in this case, he said, \"regardless of the battery of attorneys, the outcome would be the \nsame. Every issue that was debated in public was debated in our office before this case \nwent to the grand jury.\" \nIn this case, it is not the victims credibility but the state attorneys that deserves \nquestioning. \nPalm Beach Post Editorial #2 \nMassaging the system \nPalm Beach Post Editorial \nThursday, August 10, 2006 \nPalm Beach police say their 11-month investigation shows that 53-year-old part-time \ntown resident Jeffrey Epstein committed unlawful sex acts with and lewd and lascivious \nmolestation on five underage girls. Defense attorney Jack Goldberger claims that his \nclient, Jeffrey Epstein, had no idea that the untrained girls he hired for massages were \nminors. \nThe Palm Beach Count State Attorneys Office could have let a jury decide whom to \nbelieve. Instead, State Attorney Barry Krischer left the public to wonder whether the \nsystem tilted in favor of a wealthy, well-connected alleged perpetrator and against very \nyoung girls who are alleged victims of sex crimes. \nMr. Krischer took the unusual step of referring the case to a grand jury, which last month \nindicted Jeffrey Epstein on one felony count of solicitation of prostitution. That decision \ncame after Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz met with prosecutors to undermine \nthe credibility of the 14- to 17-yearold girls who charged that Mr. Epstein had paid them \n$200 to $300 to undress and massage him in his five-bedroom, 7 1/2 -bath home on the \nIntracoastal Waterway. \nThe girls, Mr. Dershowitz told prosecutors, had written on myspace.com about smoking \nmarijuana and drinking alcohol. But if the girls have a credibility problem, what about \nJeffrey Epstein? Mr. Goldberger, told The Post: \"Mr. Epstein absolutely insisted anybody \nwho came to his house be over the age of 18. How he verified that, I don't know.\" And \nprosecutors took him at his word? \nPolice collected evidence that refutes Jeffrey Epstein's defense. Police searched his home \nand garbage and found phone messages about the girls' school schedules and even a high \nschool transcript, suggesting that Mr. Epstein at least knew that the girls were teenagers. \nThe state attorneys office has responded to criticism from Palm Beach police and others \nby noting the higher standard prosecutors face for conviction than law-enforcement \nofficers do for arrest. But in this case, the state attorney bowed to the risk that a jury \nmight look at both Jeffrey Epstein and the girls, and point fingers at both sides. \nEven if the girls could be impugned as prostitutes, solicitation of a minor is a crime. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030301 \nFormer disc jockey and teacher Bruno Moore was charged with that Tuesday. \nInvestigators say the 34-year-old used the Internet - myspace.com - to recruit a 13-year \nold. \nPolice say Jeffrey Epstein used a 20-year-old woman who had a myspace.com  \naccount to recruit young girls. His actions were sleazy. It would have been good to ask a \njury just how criminal they were. \nPalm Beach Post Editorial #3 \nSpare us the outrage \nWednesday, February 13, 2008 \nAn 11-month police investigation led to an indictment on one felony charge of \nsolicitation of prostitution. That was in July 2006, and part-time Palm Beacher \nJeffrey Epstein still has faced no repercussions for allegedly preying on underage \ngirls. \nSo maybe Mr. Epstein is satisfied that he's getting his moneys worth from his large \nlegal team, which includes Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz \n(remember O.J. Simpson?) and Kenneth Starr (remember Monica Lewinsky?). Jack \nGoldberger of West Palm Beach, who's also on the team, told Post columnist Jose \nLambiet in November: \"This case is absolutely going to end without a trial within \nthe next two months.\" \nHe was wrong, but Mr. Goldberger remains on Mr. Epstein's payroll, feigning \nmoral outrage at two lawsuits filed this year against the Manhattan money \nmanager. The lawsuits allege sexual exploitation of teenaged girls, one of \nthem as young as 14. Said Mr. Goldberger after the first lawsuit, seeking \nmore than $50 million, was filed on Jan. 24: \"We think this shows what this \ncase is all about: money.\" Yes, it is - Mr. Epstein's effort to buy his way out \nof prosecution. \nAccording to the lawyer of a 17-year-old whose parents are suing him, Mr. Epstein \nmasturbated in front of her (she was 14 at the time) and used a vibrator on her at his \nhome in February 2005. Another Epstein attorney, Lilly Ann Sanchez dismissed it: \n\"Jeffrey Epstein did not have sex with this woman.\" \nFor those girls who claim that he did, Mr. Epstein's lawyers maintain that he did not \nknow their ages, despite a police search of his home and garbage that found phone \nmessages about the girls school schedules and even a high school transcript. For all of \nhis money, Mr. Epstein's best defense remains \"I didn't know that I was a criminal \npervert\"? \nPalm Beach Post Editorial #4 \nRich man fought the law and he mostly won \nPalm Beach Post Editorial \nMonday, July 07, 2008 \nTwo years after a grand jury indicted him on a felony charge of solicitation of \nprostitution, Jeffrey Epstein finally admitted that he lured a teenage girl to his $8.5 \nmillion, 13,000-square-foot Palm Beach mansion for sex. A week ago, the 55-yearold \ninvestment banker began serving 18 months in jail. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030302 \nBut that plea deal - guilty of felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring a \nperson under the age of 18 for prostitution - does not account for all five of the girls, \none as young as 14, who alleged that Epstein sexually abused them. And why is Epstein \nserving his term in the overcrowded Palm Beach County Jail and not a state prison, where \ninmates are sent if their sentences are longer than one year? \nThe slow, dissatisfying resolution of the case sends a message to the public \nPost your that there's a different system of justice for the wealthy who hire highcomments \npowered lawyers. Epstein's legal team included West Palm Beach defense \non this attorney Jack Goldberger, Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz, \nwho defended O.J. Simpson against murder charges, and Kenneth Starr, the \nprosecutor who pursued then-President Bill Clinton for lying about sex with \nyoung women. \nPalm Beach police spent 11 months investigating Epstein before State Attorney Barry \nKrischer sent the case to a grand jury, instead of charging Epstein so the man who once \nboasted of accepting only billionaire clients could face a trial. The police had taken a high \nschool transcript, class schedules and phone messages from Epstein's home that showed \nhe knew the girls were underage. Yet Mr. Krischer was more swayed by Epstein's \nlawyers, who attempted to impugn the girls character by showing they had chatted on \nmyspace.com about smoking marijuana and drinking. He should have let a jury decide \nwhether the victims - and Epstein - were credible. \nUltimately, one charge against Epstein finally reflected the age of one victim, and the \nplea agreement left Epstein labeled a sex offender. With that additional charge, if Epstein \nhad been convicted at a trial, he could have been sentenced to anything from probation to \n15 years in prison, Assistant State Attorney Lanna Belohlavek said, adding that the \nrecommended guideline sentence was 21 months. \nEpstein also won't have to certify to the court that he is receiving counseling, typically \nrequired of sex offenders, because he has a private psychiatrist. But without court \nsupervision, who will ensure Epstein is in fact being treated? \nThe plea deal also drops a federal investigation of Epstein. If a federal investigation was \nwarranted, how does dropping it before completion benefit the public? \nEpstein preyed on girls and denied it. For three years, his wealth and the influence of his \nlawyers bought him the protection the state attorney owed to the victims. \nNew York Post — 07/27/2008 \nNew York Post - New York, N.Y. \nDate: Jul 27, 2006 \nStart Page: 014 \nSection: Page Six \nText Word Count: 395 \nIT looks like New York billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein got off easy when he was hit \nwith a charge of soliciting a prostitute for a \"happy ending\" in Palm Beach. \nBecause if Palm Beach police had their way, Epstein, 53 - who surrendered last Sunday \nand is out on $3,000 bail - might have been whacked with far more serious charges of \npaying underage girls for sex. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030303 \nBut a state grand jury found the witnesses in the case were not credible and threw out all \nbut the single charge of soliciting a hooker in his luxurious Palm Beach home. Epstein's \nlawyers and friends now say he's the hapless victim of a vendetta by Palm Beach Police \nChief Michael Reiter, whom they describe as a \"born-again nut case.\" \nAccording to the police investigation, a copy of which was obtained by the Palm Beach \nPost, detectives took statements from 17 witnesses and five alleged victims. Haley \nRobson, 20, a Palm Beach Community College student who described herself as \"like a \nHeidi Fleiss,\" says she got naked to give Epstein a massage, then brought him six girls \nages 14-16 for massages and sex at his home. She said they were paid $200 per session. \nCops also allege that Epstein's personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, who hasn't been charged, \nset up the liaisons and put fresh sheets on the massage table and supplied massage oils. \nPolice searched through Epstein's garbage and retrieved sex toys and feminine hygiene \nproducts. \nEpstein's Palm Beach lawyer, Jack Goldberger, told Page Six that the Florida state \nattorney concluded the cops had looked at evidence from a \"one-sided perspective.\" He \nadded that Epstein had passed an extensive lie-detector test in which he was grilled about \nunderage girls. \nEpstein's New York lawyer, Gerald Lefcourt, said, \"The prosecutor didn't want to bring \nany charges in this case, but because of the craziness of this police chief, we have the \ncharge of solicitation.\" \nLast night, WPTV in Palm Beach reported that one reason Robson's testimony may have \nbeen dismissed is the kinky Web page she has on MySpace featuring photos of her \nfemale friends playing with sex toys. One friend even uses the name \"Pimpin Made EZ.\" \nRobson, who isn't charged, also writes, \"Do what you do to make that money, life is \na gamble. Stay hustling.\" \nA spokeswoman for Reiter said, \"We think our investigation speaks for itself\" \nCops also allege that [Jeffrey Epstein] 's personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, who hasn't been \ncharged, set up the liaisons and put fresh sheets on the massage table and supplied \nmassage oils.

Epstein is currently charged by \nthe State of Florida with soliciting young prostitutes for sex - but federal \ncharges would be far more serious. \nThe Palm Beach Post reported yesterday that Epstein is very close to a deal \nwith the feds that would send him to jail for 11/2 to 2 years. Sources tell us that \nwhile a deal has not yet solidified, what's under discussion is a guilty plea to \nat least one charge in exchange for a sentence of 15 months in a Florida state \nprison, followed by 15 months of home confinement. That would be a fraction \nof the time he would have to serve if he were to be convicted by a jury. \nEpstein's spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, said his client would have no \ncomment. Dershowitz also declined to comment late yesterday. \nPalm Beach police records show that on March 15, 2005, a 14-year-old girl \nalleged she had visited Epstein's estate, where she partially stripped and \ngave him a massage during which he \"pulled out a purple vibrator\" and used it \non her in exchange for $300. A further probe uncovered five young women \nwho said Epstein had masturbated and touched their genitals during \nmassages, the records state. A woman named Haley Robson - who \ndescribed herself as \"like a Heidi Fleiss\" - later admitted bringing six girls \nbetween the ages of 14 and 16 to Epstein's house, according to cops. \nDespite the allegations, Epstein was only nailed on a single charge of \nsoliciting a hooker - but it sparked a federal probe. Epstein's lawyers and \nfriends have insisted he was the hapless victim of a vendetta by Palm Beach \nPolice Chief Michael Reiter, whom they described as a \"born-again nutcase.\" \nPalm Beach Post - 08/14/ 2006 \nPolice chiefs reputation helps discredit attacks \nBy Larry Keller \nPalm Beach Post - Monday, August 14, 2006 \nIn the case of Palm Beach financier Jeffrey Epstein, it seems, at times, as if two men are \naccused of wrongdoing: Epstein and Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter. \nEpstein, 53, was indicted last month on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution \nsolely because of Reiter's \"craziness,\" one of Epstein's lawyers said. His department \ndisseminated \"a distorted view of the case\" and behaved in a \"childish\" manner when the \ngrand jury didn't indict Epstein on the charges it sought, another Epstein lawyer \ncomplained. \nTo hear the Epstein camp tell it, Reiter, 48, is a loose cannon better suited to be the \nsheriff of Mayberry. They whisper that he's embroiled in a messy divorce. \nReiter did in fact file for divorce from his wife, (NAME REMOVED), last year, after 24 \nyears of marriage. They have a son, 18, and a daughter, 14. The couple is scheduled to go \nto mediation next week, Aug. 16. Nothing in the court file suggests their split is \nparticularly ugly. \nReiter incurred the wrath of the Epstein camp as well as the state attorneys office for two \nreasons. First, he pressed for Epstein to be charged with the more serious crimes of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030305 \nsexual activity with minors. Second, he slammed State Attorney Barry Krischer in blunt \nlanguage seldom used by one law-enforcement official concerning another because of \nwhat he perceived as that office's mishandling of the case. \nIn a letter to Krischer written May 1, Reiter called his actions in the Epstein case \"highly \nunusual.\" He added, \"I must urge you to... consider if good and sufficient reason exists to \nrequire your disqualification from the prosecution of these cases.\" In short, Reiter told \nthe county's top prosecutor for the past 13 years that he ought to get off the case. \"It \nlooks like a departure from professionalism,\" Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine \nFernandez Rundle said of Reiter's letter. \nFollowing Epstein's indictment, Reiter referred the case to the FBI to determine whether \nthe super-rich, super-connected defendant had violated any federal laws. Reiter won't \ndiscuss the case or the broadsides aimed at him. But others almost uniformly use one \nword to describe the chief: professional. \n\"I have always been impressed by Mike's professionalism and his leadership,\" said Rick \nLincoln, chief of the Lantana Police Department and a Palm Beach County cop for 32 \nyears. \"The town of Palm Beach has a very professional police department. We all \nconsider Mike to be our peer and a man of integrity.\" Juno Beach Police Chief H.C. \nClark II agreed. Although he doesn't know Reiter well, he has met with him on \ncountywide law enforcement issues. \"I've never seen him lose his cool. I've never seen \nanything but a professional demeanor from him.\" \nReiter joined the Palm Beach Police Department in 1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year patrol \njob at the University of Pittsburgh. His personnel jacket shows consistently excellent job \nevaluations. Posh Palm Beach is no hotbed of crime, and in his first year on the job, a \nresident confined to his home with a sick child thanked Reiter for delivering a few Cokes \nto the house. Reiter refused payment for the beverages. Another resident thanked Reiter \nfor shutting off his car's headlights in his driveway, saying a valet must have been at \nfault. Reiter worked everything from road patrol to organized crime, vice and narcotics. \nAnd he's no novice at investigations involving the island's rich and famous. He was the \nlead detective probing the drug overdose death of David Kennedy in 1984. He also was \none of the officers who worked the investigation of William Kennedy Smith, who was \ncharged in 1991 — and later acquitted — with raping a woman at the Kennedy family \ncompound in Palm Beach. \nReiter, who has a master's degree in human resource development from Palm Beach \nAtlantic University, also has attended the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Va., and \nmanagement courses at Harvard. He's been active in countywide interagency law \nenforcement organizations and has a \"top secret\" national security clearance. \n\"He has a perspective that's broader than just addressing the needs of the town,\" said \nTown Manager Peter \nElwell, who promoted Reiter from assistant chief to chief in March 2001. Reiter makes \nmore than $144,000 as the town's top cop. Elwell thinks he's worth it. He's very \nbusinesslike, very straightforward. He's not easily agitated or flamboyant. He's about the \nwork,\" Elwell said. \"I think that his service as chief has been outstanding in five-plus \nyears.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030306 \nNew York Times — 09/03/2006 \nQuestions of Preferential Treatment Are Raised in Sex Case Against Money Manager - \nSeptember 3, 2006 \nBy ABBY GOODNOUGH \nPALM BEACH, Fla. — In the summer and autumn of last year, when most of the \nmansions here stood empty behind their towering hedges, the police stealthily watched \none at the end of a waterside lane. They monitored the comings and goings of its owner's \nprivate jet, subpoenaed his phone records and riffled through his trash. \nThe owner was Jeffrey Epstein, 53, an intensely private New York money manager with \nseveral billionaire clients. Months earlier, the stepmother of a 14-year-old girl told the \nPalm Beach police that a wealthy older man, whom the girl later identified as Mr. \nEpstein, might have had inappropriate sexual contact with her. \nIn sworn statements to the police, the 14-year-old and other teenage girls said a friend \nhad arranged for them to visit Mr. Epstein's home and give him massages, usually in \ntheir underwear, in exchange for cash. \nMost of the girls, according to the police, said Mr. Epstein had masturbated during the \nmassages, and a few said he had penetrated them with his fingers or penis. They \nidentified him in photos and accurately described the inside of his home. Some recalled \nthat his employees had fed them snacks or rented them cars. \nMr. Epstein pleaded not guilty in August to the crime he was ultimately charged with, \nsoliciting prostitution. But at a time when prosecutors around the nation have become \nincreasingly severe in dealing with people accused of sex offenses, the case has raised \nquestions about whether Mr. Epstein's prominence won him preferential treatment. \nBy the account of the police, they found probable cause to charge Mr. Epstein with much \nmore serious offenses: one count of lewd and lascivious molestation and four counts of \nunlawful sexual activity with a minor. \nBut instead of proceeding with such charges on his own, the Palm Beach County state \nattorney took the rare step of presenting a broad range of possible charges to a grand jury, \nwhich indicted Mr. Epstein in July on the lesser count. In Florida, prosecutors usually \nrefer only capital cases to grand juries. \nEven before the indictment, the Palm Beach police chief, Michael Reiter, had accused \nprosecutors of giving Mr. Epstein special treatment and asked the state attorney, Barry E. \nKrischer, to remove himself from the case. \nIn an editorial, The Palm Beach Post attacked Mr. Krischer, a Democrat whose post is \nelective, saying the public had been left \"to wonder whether the system tilted in favor of \na wealthy, well-connected alleged perpetrator and against very young girls who are \nalleged victims of sex crimes.\" \nThe case has taken a toll on the reputation of Mr. Epstein, who owns a palatial home in \nManhattan, has pledged $30 million to Harvard and once flew former President Bill \nClinton on his 727. Politicians including Eliot Spitzer, a Democratic candidate for \ngovernor in New York, and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, also a Democrat, have \nreturned campaign contributions from him. \nBut Mr. Epstein fought back, assembling a team of star lawyers, including Gerald B. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030307 \nLefcourt and Alan M. Dershowitz, a friend of his, to look into the backgrounds of his \nyoung accusers. \nMr. Lefcourt says that the police acted \"outrageously\" and that his client has been \nwrongfully dragged through the mud. \n\"He disputes that he ever had sex with any under-age person or anything like that,\" said \nMr. Lefcourt, whose clients have included Russell Crowe, Martha Stewart and Abbie \nHoffman. \nNeither the police nor the state attorney's office would discuss the case in detail. But the \npolice released a thick report on the 13-month investigation after the indictment was \nunsealed in late July. \nThe police started investigating Mr. Epstein in March 2005, almost immediately after \nthey were contacted by the stepmother of the 14-year-old, who, according to the report, \nwas in a special school for students with disciplinary problems. \nThe girl, the report said, told the police that an older friend had \"offered her an \nopportunity to make money\" and had driven her to Mr. Epstein's house one Sunday. The \nfriend, identified by the police as Haley Robson, a local community college student, told \nthe girl to say she was 18 if Mr. Epstein asked, the report said. \nThe girl told the police that Mr. Epstein's assistant had led her upstairs to a room with a \nmassage table and that Mr. Epstein had come in and told her to remove her clothes. She \nsaid Mr. Epstein had masturbated as she massaged him, had pressed a vibrator against her \nunderwear and had given her $300 afterward. \nIn October, the police interviewed Ms. Robson, then 19, who told them Mr. Epstein had \nroutinely paid her to bring teenage girls to his home. The police then interviewed a total \nof 5 alleged victims and 17 witnesses, many of whom told similar stories about what they \nhad observed or participated in at Mr. Epstein's home. According to the report, at least \none said Mr. Epstein had engaged in intercourse with her. \nMr. Lefcourt, his lawyer, said one girl who told the police of having had sex with Mr. \nEpstein as a minor had lied about both the sex and her age and had not shown up for \ngrand jury questioning. He also said Mr. Epstein had passed a lie-detector test clearing \nhim of any sexual involvement with under-age girls. \nA spokeswoman for the Palm Beach police said that early this year, the police went to \nMr. Krischer, the state attorney, intending to apply for warrants to arrest Mr. Epstein. \nInstead, she said, they were told that Mr. Krischer would convene a grand jury to \nexamine the evidence and decide what charges, if any, to bring. \nAround that time, the police report said, Mr. Dershowitz met with prosecutors to share \ninformation about the accusers, including statements they had posted on MySpace.com, \nthe social networking site, concerning use of drugs and alcohol. According to the report, \nMr. Krischer's office then decided to delay the grand jury session for several months. \nThe Palm Beach police grew frustrated, the report said, and on May 1 the department \nasked prosecutors to approve warrants to arrest Mr. Epstein. \nChief Reiter also wrote Mr. Krischer questioning \"the unusual course that your office's \nhandling of this matter has taken\" and suggesting that Mr. Krischer disqualify himself. \nChief Reiter refused several requests to be interviewed, and his spokeswoman would not \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030308 \nsay explicitly why he had urged the prosecutor to step aside. \nMike Edmondson, a spokesman for Mr. Krischer, said the state attorney's office \nsometimes sent noncapital cases to grand juries when there were questions about witness \ncredibility. Mr. Krischer does not recommend a particular charge in such cases, Mr. \nEdmondson said, but gives the grand jury a list of possible charges. \nBruce J. Winick, a law professor at the University of Miami, said that while prosecutors \nin Florida rarely referred noncapital cases to grand juries, they sometimes did so with \nsensitive cases to be extra-cautious. \nMr. Lefcourt said the police were wrong to have released the report so soon, especially \nwithout correcting information that later proved wrong. He cited his assertion that one \naccuser had lied about her age, adding that she had also been arrested on drug charges \nand had been fired by her employer for stealing. \n\"What I'm trying to focus on,\" Mr. Lefcourt said, \"is, What's motivating the selective \nand misleading release of information to the public?\" \nCopyright 2006 The New York Times Company \nNew York Times — 06/30/08 \nFinancier Starts Sentence in Prostitution Case -NYTimes.com Page 1 of 4 ge 1 of 4 \nJuly 1, 2008 \nFinancier Starts Sentence in Prostitution Case \nBy LANDON THOMAS Jr. \nThe bad news arrived by phone last week on Little St. James Island, the palm-fringed \nXanadu in the Caribbean where Jeffrey E.

Regardless of whether the Guidelines are advisory, this is the fairest way to proceed for\ndefendants, the prosecution, and victims.\n\n(New) Rule 32(1)(4) - Victims' Right to be Reasonably Heard at Sentencing The Proposals:\n\nEven before passage of the CVRA, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure gave victims of crimes of violence or sexual abuse\nthe right to be heard at sentencing. After the CVRA extended such rights to all victims, I proposed simply striking the limitation\nin the rule so that it would apply to all victims as follows:\n\n(B) By a Victim. Before imposing sentence, the court must address any victim of a the crime of violence or sexual abuse who is\npresent at sentencing and must permit the victim to speak or submit any information about the sentence ... . 434\n\nThe Advisory Committee tracked my change of striking the crimes of violence and sexual abuse limitation; but the Committee\nalso substituted language from the CVRA about being reasonably heard as follows:\n\n(B) By a Victim. Before imposing sentence, the court must address any victim of a the crime of violence or sexual abuse who is\n\npresent at sentencing and must permit the victim to speak or submit any information about the sentence to be reasonably heard.\n435\n\n[*939] Discussion:\n\nMy proposal retained the current language in Rule 32 allowing the victim \"to speak or submit any information about the\nsentence\"; the Advisory Committee would allow the victim \"to be reasonably heard\" at sentencing - language lifted from the\nCVRA.\n\nIn this area, the Advisory Committee has paradoxically used the CVRA as an occasion for possibly restricting victims’ rights.\nUnder Rule 32()(4)'s current language, there is no doubt that the victim could \"speak\" at sentencing (that is, give an oral\nstatement). Under the proposed language, litigation could result about whether victims could be \"reasonably heard\" without\nbeing allowed to speak (that is, be confined to purely written submissions). Indeed, during the Advisory Committee meeting on\nthe proposal, the Advisory Committee reporter conceded that \"courts would have to construe exactly what [the phrase] meant\nas situations came before them.\" °°\n\nIt is worth reflecting for a moment on how backward the Advisory Committee's approach to this issue is. Before the CVRA's\nenactment, victims of crimes of violence and sexual assault had the right under Rule 32(1) \"to speak\" at sentencing (along with\nthe right to submit information). When Congress enacted the CVRA, the Advisory Committee and the Judicial Conference had\n\n(11th Cir. 2006); United States v. Vampire Nation, 451 F.3d 189, 195-98 (3d Cir. 2006); United States v. Walker, 447 F.3d 999, 1006-07\n(7th Cir. 2006); United States v. Egenberger, 424 F.3d 803, 805 (Sth Cir. 2005). The First Circuit has held only that the failure to provide\nnotice does not constitute plain error. See United States v. Mateo, No. 06-1805, 2006 WL 1195676, at 1 (1st Cir. May 5, 2006).\n\n#3 For a helpful correction to the idea that victims’ interests are always adverse to defense interests at sentencing, see generally Benji\nMcMurray, The Mitigating Power of a Victim Focus at Sentencing, 19 Fed.

The Advisory Committee also proposes striking out existing language in the\ntule allowing guardians or family members to exercise the right to speak on behalf of minor and incapacitated victims.

National frontiers\nthat were put in place by British and French diplomats after the fall of the\nOttoman Empire are vanishing. Centuries-old conflicts between tribes and rival\nreligious communities have reignited. The old Cold War system of nations has\ngiven way to a world without a single geopolitical centre of gravity. Perhaps\nmost seriously, Iran seems determined to get nuclear weapons, and, in my view,\nmay succeed in doing so.\n\nWhere Israel is concerned, relations with our indisputably most important\nally, the United States, are more strained than at any time in decades.\nDiplomatic ties with Europe, our single largest trading partner, have been\ngrowing steadily worse. And the only real certainty is that anyone who tells you\nthat they know absolutely where things are heading next is lying. Just ask Hosni\nMubarak, who, despite having nearly half-a-million soldiers and security\noperatives at his disposal, was utterly blindsided, and very soon toppled and\nimprisoned, by an uprising that began with a sudden show of popular anger in\nCairo’s Tahrir Square.\n\nInternally as well, Israel faces dangers. Chief among them is the alarming\nerosion of the standards of civil discourse, amid the increasingly shrill, often\nhateful, divisions between left and right, secular and religious, rich and poor\nand, most seriously of all, Jews and Arabs. While we remain economically\nsuccessful, the fruits of our wealth are being ever more unevenly shared, and the\nprospects for continued growth constrained by the lack of any visible prospect\nof long-term peace.\n\nBibi Netanyahu, of course, knows all of this. Indeed, he has repeatedly\nspoken of the multiple threats Israel faces, not only in somber terms, but at\ntimes almost apocalyptically.\n\nThat works, politically. Politicians, not just in Israel but everywhere, know\nthat it is a lot easier to win elections on fear than on hope.\n\nYet my own prescription — learned, as this book recounts, from years on the\nbattlefield, then reinforced by my years in government — is that Israel must\nresist being guided by either of those alternatives. Not fear, certainly. But\nneither by simple, untempered hope.

Earlier legislation had established the Congressional-Executive Commission\n\non China, focused on human rights conditions in China (a perennial negative aspect\n\nin US-China relations), and the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission,\nwhich was known for its annual report listing a variety of developments in China seen\n\nas adverse to US interests and values. While the latter two commissions continue to be\nactive, are robust, and have growing impact, many of the other exchange mechanisms\nhave proven less than durable. Once the leading members who founded such groups leave\nCongress, interest usually wanes. The National People’s Congress became even more active\nin supporting the growing number of congressional staff delegations to China during\n\nthis period. In 2018, the House China Working Group remained active, but the House\nCongressional China Caucus and the Senate China Working Group were inactive.\n\nMost recently, the 115th Congress has actively embraced the Trump administration’s view\nthat China has benefited more from the bilateral relationship than has the United States.\nIn fact, amidst all the partisan warfare currently dividing Republicans and Democrats in\nWashington, a skepticism about China’s intentions and reliability and a willingness to\npush back in a bipartisan manner against its un-reciprocal, and sometimes even predatory,\npolicies, is one of the most surprising phenomena. In 2018, for example, the Congress\nunanimously passed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages the Trump administration to\nhost more high-ranking officials from Taiwan, a move that angered Beijing. Still, Congress is\nhardly united, even on trade. Some members have objected to the adverse impacts punitive\ntariffs are having on their constituencies, or they have opposed imposing tariffs on allies\nat the same time tariffs are imposed on China. And some members criticized President\nTrump’s decision in May 2018 to ease harsh sanctions against the prominent Chinese\nhigh-technology firm ZTE, in response to a personal plea from the Chinese president.\nNevertheless, President Trump’s dominance in the Republican Party means that few in the\nRepublican ranks controlling Congress are inclined to oppose him, especially on China.\nIndeed, Congress is generally endorsing the most significant reevaluation of American-\nChina policy since the start of normalization fifty years ago. As such, it can be said that\nChinese influence on Capitol Hill has reached a low point.\n\nConclusion and Recommendations\n\nCongress is in the midst of a major reevaluation of the very assumptions underlying\n\nthe decades-old American policy of “engagement” with China. Because of this increasingly\ncompetitive, even adversarial, new climate, Chinese influence and information operations\nare widely coming to be seen as expressions of a political system whose values are\nantithetical to those of the United States and as a threat to the integrity of Congress and\nour democracy.

A former top intelligence official told me “The queen on our chessboard had been\ntaken.”\n\nTo be sure, even after the loss of its “queen,” the game was not lost. The NSA moved to\nmitigate the damage and find new ways of obtaining unexpected intelligence. In June 2014, the\nnew NSA director Admiral Michael Rogers had to confront flagging morale that, according to\nformer director Michael Hayden, was near-paralyzing the intelligence service. Admiral Rogers\nrecognized that as a direct result of the Snowden breach “the nation has lost capabilities against\nadversaries right now who are attempting to actively undermine us.\" But even with that loss, he\nobserved “the sky has not fallen.” As in the Chicken Little fable he cited, the world had not\nended for the NSA.

The NSA may have lost many of its sources, or “capabilities,” but Rogers held out\nhope that new sources could be eventually found to replace them. Compromised codes, after all,\ncould be changed. New technological methods could be devised. New vulnerabilities also could\nbe targeted in enemy territories. Although repairing the damage might take many “decades.”\naccording to Michael McConnell, the Vice Chairman of Booz Allen, the new director had to get\non with that task. McConnell, a former NSA director himself, pointed out that the NSA\nDirector’s “first responsibility is to be the chief cheerleader.\" Rebuilding the NSA capabilities\nassumed, however, that there would not be another Snowden-size breach.\n\nThe question remained: how could the NSA’s vaunted secrecy have been so deeply penetrated\nby a mere analyst-in-training at a regional base in Oahu? The perpetrator himself could not be\nasked. He was in Moscow, supposedly employed by an unnamed Russian cyber security firm. He\nwas also in his Moscow interviews pointing to the “incompetence” of the NSA. All that was\nknown for certain about the young man who had taken the “queen” from the board was that he\nhad gained entry to the NSA’s secret chambers through the back door, a portal opened to him by\nthe NSA’s reliance on outside contractors.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020313\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Ah, along\nwith his entourage of managers, coaches and fans were shocked, though no one denied that he lost. The\nunknown boxer was Leon Spinks. His only prior claim to fame, and ticket to a shot at Ali, was an\nOlympic gold medal two years earlier. With this win, not only did Spinks enjoy the heavyweight belt of\nchampions, but a cash prize of $350,000 and a promise of $3.8 million for the rematch with Ali. But this\nmeteoric rise to the top fizzled into a meteoric crash, driven by women, alcohol, sports cars, and a lack of\ntraining. Leon Spinks, aka “Neon Leon,” was living the fast life, and rapidly losing his status as a\nrespected sports hero.\n\nMoments before his rematch with Ali, he cruised the streets of New Orleans on top of a limousine\nwhile smoking a joint. He was flaunting his nonchalance, making fun of Ali’s age, and carrying on about\nhis ability to take the old champ without a single work out. When he entered the ring, Ali was ready.\nThough the match went the full fifteen rounds, it was no contest. Ali won.\n\nNewspaper writers and boxing fans celebrated the return of their champion, and mocked the\ndownfall of an ephemeral, arrogant, and out of control hero. After losing to Ali in the rematch, Neon\nLeon crashed further, losing all of his earnings, taking on odd jobs for minimum wage, losing a son in a\ngang fight, and suffering defeat after defeat in the boxing arena. From envied millionaire sports star to\nbankrupt fool and the laughingstock of the boxing world.\n\nWhen the envied fall down, we perversely enjoy the knock out. This is schadenfreude, a German\nword that describes the joy we feel in witnessing another’s misfortune. Though the emotion is universally\nunderstood, recognized in our written records at least as far back as Aristotle, the German language is one\nof the few to capture the feeling by tapping the brain’s promiscuity, combining the word for harm\n(schaden) with the word for joy (freude). Like envy, schadenfreude is a social, comparative emotion. It\nerupts when those we envy fall down, when someone we dislike meets his comeuppance, and when a\nmisfortune is deserved. But like envy, schadenfreude presents two faces, one elevating and virtuous, the\nother deflating and divisive. We should feel good when a person is caught crossing a moral line,\ncommitting an injustice. Such feelings not only reinforce our own adherence to moral norms, but\nencourage us to punish those who transgress. Such feelings instill courage in the service of expressing\nmoral outrage. As Robert F. Kennedy stated “Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle\nor intelligence.” Schadenfreude in this positive sense is the inner voice of moral courage. At the same\n\ntime, it can also be the inner voice of moral disengagement, providing justification for an observed harm.\n\nHauser Chapter 2.

With war looming in Asia and Europe, President\nFranklin D. Roosevelt reactivated the operation as the Signals Security Agency. It proved its\nvalue in breaking the Japanese machine-generated cipher “purple.” In June 1942, using deciphered\nJapanese messages to pinpoint the location of the Japanese fleet at Midway; America’s won a\ndecisive naval victory in the Pacific. Germany’s Enigma encoding machines, with three encoding\nwheels, proved more of a challenge. Initially British cryptanalysts led by the brilliant\nmathematician Alan Turing succeeded in building a rudimentary computer to decipher German\nmessages to its submarines and bombers, but, in 1942, Germany added a fourth set of encoding\nwheels, escalation what essentially was a battle of machine intelligence. The US Navy then\ncontracted with the National Cash Register Company to build a computing machine capable of\nbreaking the improved Enigma, and, in May 1943, it succeeded. By the time the war ended in\n1945, the US had over one hundred giant decryption machines in operation. This unrivalled\ncapability to read the communications of foreign nations, which remained one of America’s most\nclosely guarded secrets, was transferred to the Army Security Agency based at Fort Meade,\nMaryland. Then, on October 24, 1952, President Harry S. Truman, greatly expanded its purview\nand changed its name to the National Security Agency.\n\nThe NSA was given two missions. The first one was protecting the communications of the\nUS government. The main threat to breaching U.S. government channels of communications was\nthe Soviet. The second one was intercepting all the relevant communications and signals of\nforeign governments. This latter mandate included the governments of allies as well as enemies.\nThe President, the other intelligence services and the Department of Defense deemed what was\nrelevant for national security.

With the transient nature of marina tenants, a historical\nrent and occupancy figures are a more accurate indication of the income properties of the marina.\nRental rates at the subject, and in this market, are based ona rate per linear foot of vessel length. As\ndiscussed earlier, the subject contains 105 wet slips with a total of 5,680 linear feet of rentable dock\nspace, which indicates a total of 2,073,200 rentable linear feet per year.\n\nAs of the effective valuation date, the subject marina has experienced an overall occupancy rate of\n56.3% for the year to date 2015. We have looked at occupancy rates on an average, annual basis due\nto the seasonal characteristics of this property type in this market. Again, due to the transient nature\nof the tenants in this property type and the short term nature of the leases which can range from daily\nto annually, the overall occupancy rate will be lower than other commercial property types such as\nlodging, multifamily, retail and office. The subject’s current occupancy rate is slightly lower than\nhistorical rates, but the property is considered to be at stabilized occupancy.\n\nThe weighted average contract rate is $37.29 per linear foot per month for the year to date 2015,\nwhich equates to an average contract rate of $447.50 per linear foot per year.\n\nIGY American Yacht Harbor Marina\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018840\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

(Throughout the report, “China” refers to the Chinese Communist Party and the\ngovernment apparatus of the People’s Republic of China, and not to Chinese society at large\nor the Chinese people as a whole.) Not only are the values of China’s authoritarian system\nanathema to those held by most Americans, but there is also a growing body of evidence\n\nthat the Chinese Communist Party views the American ideals of freedom of speech, press,\nassembly, religion, and association as direct challenges to its defense of its own form of one-\nparty rule.”\n\nBoth the US and China have derived substantial benefit as the two nations have become\nmore economically and socially intertwined. The value of combined US-China trade\n($635.4 billion, with a $335.4 US deficit) far surpasses that between any other pair of\ncountries.? More than 350,000 Chinese students currently study in US universities (plus\n80,000 more in secondary schools). Moreover, millions of Chinese have immigrated to\nthe United States seeking to build their lives with more economic, religious, and political\nfreedom, and their presence has been an enormous asset to American life.\n\nHowever, these virtues cannot eclipse the reality that in certain key ways China is\nexploiting America’s openness in order to advance its aims on a competitive playing field\nthat is hardly level. For at the same time that China’s authoritarian system takes advantage\nof the openness of American society to seek influence, it impedes legitimate efforts by\nAmerican counterpart institutions to engage Chinese society on a reciprocal basis. This\ndisparity lies at the heart of this project’s concerns.\n\nChina’s influence activities have moved beyond their traditional United Front focus\n\non diaspora communities to target a far broader range of sectors in Western societies,\nranging from think tanks, universities, and media to state, local, and national government\ninstitutions. China seeks to promote views sympathetic to the Chinese Government,\npolicies, society, and culture; suppress alternative views; and co-opt key American players to\nsupport China’s foreign policy goals and economic interests.\n\nNormal public diplomacy, such as visitor programs, cultural and educational exchanges,\npaid media inserts, and government lobbying are accepted methods used by many\ngovernments to project soft power. They are legitimate in large measure because they are\ntransparent. But this report details a range of more assertive and opaque “sharp power”\nactivities that China has stepped up within the United States in an increasingly active\nmanner.* These exploit the openness of our democratic society to challenge, and sometimes\neven undermine, core American freedoms, norms, and laws.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020461\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

One of whom we know personally, and have worked with. Now, again,\nwith no real reason, you’ve stopped us. I see this as a breach of trust.” When\nneither Dado nor Motta replied, I went on: “I have to tell you openly. You can’t\npossibly judge the situation on the ground. Only we can. And you’re behaving\nas if you know. You can’t know from here. There was no reason for us not to\ngrab those officers. I don’t want to reach a point when I have to start thinking\nabout what to report back, or not report, just to make sure we’re free to\ncomplete a mission that you ordered, after agreeing it was necessary for Israel.”\n\nNo one said anything for a few moments. I could see that Uzi, Mookie and\nBibi were shocked at having heard me speak in this way to three of the top\ncommanders of the armed forces. But I meant every word. If Sayeret Matkal\nwas to function as a special-forces unit, it needed to have the trust of those\nwho’d authorized an operation in the first place. It was Dado who finally\nreplied. Sort of. Trying to defuse the tension, he told us a joke from his Palmach\ndays. “There are two bulls who come into a field full of cows. A young one and\nold one. The young one says to the old guy: let’s run over there to the far end of\nthe field, where the prettiest cow is, and we can fuck her. The old bull replies:\n“No need to rush. Let’s go slowly, and fuck them all.”\n\nI guess we were meant to be the young bulls.\n\nI doubt Dado knew whether we’d get a third chance at the Syrian officers,\nthough I’m sure he hoped so. A week later, we got word there would be a final\ninspection visit, to the central sector of the border area. Ordinarily, I would have\nled the operation. Now, I made an exception. To Dado’s obvious surprise, I\ndecided to remain behind, in the command post. “A commander has to be in the\nbest place to ensure a mission is successfully completed,” I told him. “I’ve\ncome to the conclusion the only way I can do that is to be here with you.\nBecause the real bottleneck isn’t out there in the field. It’s here.”\n\nI placed Yoni, who had just become my deputy, in overall command of the\ntwo main teams: Uzi Dayan’s and another led by one of our most impressive\nyoung officers, a kibbutznik named Danny Brunner. He reminded me a lot of\nNechemia Cohen: he spoke little, and softly, but once an operation began was\ncalm, clear minded and able to anticipate and avoid trouble before it\nmaterialized. Two other teams, one led by Mookie Betzer and the other by Shai\nAgmon, would act as blocking units, concealed half-a-mile on either side, once\nthe main force intercepted the convoy.

But\noften we might behave differently in how we treat others, if we real-\nized what we were doing. Getting along with people is a very big part\nof life. Each of us has our own distinct personality and often it doesn’t\nmatch with our own ambitions and desires. To change our behavior,\nwe need to practice new behaviors that become as natural to us as\nour old behaviors. The only way to do this is to do it. People can help\npoint out what you are doing that isn’t helpful to your needs but that\ndoes not mean you can easily change. If you want to change, you need\nto try new behaviors and practice them. This can be coached. Practic-\ning new behaviors and being critiqued can help greatly. Written com-\nmunication is handled the same way.\n\n2. Teamwork: Learning how to achieve goals by using a team,\nconsciously allocating roles, managing inputs from others,\ncoordinating actors, and handling conflicts\n\nIt is the rare individual who works all alone. Most people need\nto work with others. Children are not naturally good at this and are\ntaught to “share.” Then they sometimes do what is called “parallel\nplay” where they play near one another doing different things. Get-\nting kids to cooperate to do something together is not easy. Usually\none wants to dominate the others. There is nothing wrong with this\nper se. People are who they are and they need to assume roles in any\nteam that are consonant with their personalities. One person plays\nquarterback and another blocks. People do not have to do the same\nthing in order to work together. But they do need to get along and\nfunction as a team. This is no more true of sports than it is of the\nworkplace. People learn to work in teams by working in teams and re-\nceiving helpful advice when a team is dysfunctional. Football coaches\nexplicitly teach this. More formal learning situations (like school) of-\nten don’t, which is unfortunate. It really isn’t possible to get along in\nthe real world unless you can assume various roles in a team that fit\nwith who you are.\n\n3.

Within 14 days after receiving the presentence report, the parties must state in writing any objections,\nincluding objections to material information, sentencing guideline ranges, and policy statements contained in or omitted from\nthe report. The attorney for the government or for the victim shall raise for the victim any reasonable objection by the victim to\nthe presentence report.\n\n(2) Serving Objections.

After receiving objections, the probation officer may meet with the parties and the victim to discuss\nthe objections. The probation officer may then investigate further and revise the presentence report as appropriate.\n\n(h) Notice of Intent to Consider Other Sentencing Factors. 73 Before the court may rely on a ground not identified either in the\n[*930] presentence report or in a party's prehearing submission or in a victim impact statement, the court must give the parties\nreasonable notice that it is contemplating either departing from the applicable guideline range or imposing a non-guideline\nsentence. The notice must specify any ground not earlier identified on which the court is contemplating a departure or a non-\nguideline sentence. The attorney for the government or for the victim shall advise defense counsel and the court of any ground\nidentified by the victim that might reasonably serve as a basis for departure.\n\n(i) Sentencing.\n(1) In General. At sentencing, the court:\n\n(A) must verify that the defendant and the defendant's attorney have read and discussed the presentence report and any\naddendum to the report;\n\n(B) must give to the defendant and an attorney for the government a written summary of - or summarize in camera - any\ninformation excluded from the presentence report under Rule 32(d)(3) on which the court will rely in sentencing, and give them\na reasonable opportunity to comment on that information;\n\n(C) must allow the parties' attorneys and any victims to comment on the probation officer's determinations and other matters\nrelating to an appropriate sentence; and\n\n(D) may, for good cause, allow a party or any victim to make a new objection at any time before sentence is imposed.\n\n(2) Introducing Evidence; Producing a Statement. The court may permit the parties or the victim to introduce evidence on the\nobjections. If a witness testifies at sentencing, Rule 26.2(a)-(d) and (f) applies. If a party fails to comply with a Rule 26.2 order\nto produce a witness's statement, the court must not consider that witness's testimony.\n\n(3) Court Determinations.

Academy rules and Woody forbade marketing this gem.  \n\n\n\nWoody is not a member of the Academy because he doesn’t feel that films should be in competition. He told me, \"A statue does not change your life. You still get a cold. You can't get a date. You still have everyday things to worry about\". The Academy learned to love him from a distance and gave him best original screenplay as a consolation. \n\n\n\nTerrence Malick's long awaited esoteric \"The Tree of Life\" unveiled at Cannes and won the coveted \" Palme D'Or \" positioning it for a nomination. \n\n\n\n\"The Artist\", created by the French, shot in Hollywood and about Hollywood was the festival surprise. This charming and oddly original black and white silent entry was introduced by the ringmaster himself, Harvey Weinstein. No one could pronounce or spell director Michel Hazanavicius's name. Jean Dujardin could not speak a word of English and neither could his 10 year old co-star, the Jack Russell Uggie who had been rescued from the pound after two adopters found him too wild. Tragically Uggie developed an undisclosed neurological disorder during production, forcing him to retire at the height of his popularity. \n\n\n\nNo slam dunk Oscar winner emerged in Cannes. Any future film could easily win.  \n\n\n\nDreamWorks’ \"The Help\" premiered in LA in August and distributer Disney began propelling the politically correct and socially significant film to box office heaven of $200 million. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer were forecast to win Oscars.  \n\n\n\nIn September, the Toronto and New York Film Festivals and Fox Searchlight presented Alexander s's Hawaiian family saga, \"The Descendants,\" which broke out of the pack with whispers of winning. Beloved George Clooney, playing a father for the first time was hailed a shoe-in for best actor. Directing \"Ides of March\" was additional momentum.\n\n\n\nAlso at New York's festival Marty Scorsese and Paramount sneaked an unfinished cut of \"Hugo\" in Alice Tully Hall, built for concerts but converted into a 3-D theater. Marty was christened the visionary genius of an innovative costly 3-D masterpiece.\n\n\n\nDirector Bennett Miller's highly anticipated \"Moneyball\" for Sony hit a grand slam at its west coast premiere in Oakland aligning the film, it’s heart throb star Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill and seasoned writers Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin in play.\n\n\n\nSpielberg's epic \"War Horse\" for DreamWorks came thundering down the pike with a huge premiere back at Alice Tully Hall with posters of Lincoln Center's Tony winning theatrical \"War Horse\" with their indelible puppets in the background. Steven paid homage to legends John Ford and David Lean and the country fell in love with a horse named Joey and his fourteen stand-ins.\n\n\n\nStudios worked their stars to the bone. Ironically, Harvey's independent French talent who lived in Paris were not as available as their competitors, therefore Uggie became a super star igniting a pet war.\n\n\n\nChristopher Plummer, who had best supporting actor in the bag promoted his Jack Russell, Cosmo. Diminutive Scorsese was seen on TV on a small couch with his large Doberman, Blackie drooling on his suit. Spielberg never got a chance to trot out his lead horse Joey, previously seen in \"Seabiscuit\" because his ravishing reddish coat was now darkened for another role. \n\n\n\nBy December, as film critics bestowed their own awards upon many films, Stephen Daldry struggled to finish \"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\" with a new score. There was buzz Daldry could be editing the winner. Producer Scott Rudin juggled his astounding three films in one year from Daldry, Miller and David Fincher directing “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.”\n\n\n\nDaldry had received three consecutive directing nominations. In January, for his fourth film, he received a best picture nomination, for a boy's emotional journey dealing with 9/11, and the nine films were officially off and running. Forty-five film and media groups handed out awards leading up to Oscar night.\n\n\n\nWednesday, February 22\n\n\n\nMy airplane seatmate to LAX was Sony Classics Michael Barker. The night before Woody Allen had shown Michael \"Nero Fiddled\", his latest film shot in Rome rumored to be his best.  \n\n\n\nWhen Woody won the Oscar Sunday night, for a record breaking 23rd overall nomination, he had just finished pasta a Sette Mezzo on Lexington Avenue with art dealer Lorinda Ash and Soon-Yi.  He went home and watched the N.B.A. All-Star game. Soon-Yi watched the awards show on a delay in another room.  By the time Woody won, he fell asleep and Soon-Yi didn’t want to wake him. The next morning he went to the breakfast table alone and read in The New York Times he won. He had to think it was a good omen and he would not catch a cold that day.\n\n\n\nBefore Michael and I flattened our recliner chairs for the big sleep, I told him I felt confident his Iranian film, \"A Separation\" was winning best foreign picture. He told me \"The Artist\" would take best picture and director.  Actor was a tight race between Brad Pitt, Jean Dujardin, the \"Clooney of France\" and the real George Clooney.  George was essentially running against a version of himself, which only slightly amused him.\n\n\n\nThe biggest dilemma was Viola vs. Meryl. Michael picked Meryl as New Yorkers did.  \"The Help\" had taken on a life of its own lead by vivacious Viola in LA. \"The Iron Lady\", a much criticized film showcased Meryl's tour de force performance. Few knew at the last minute, on President's weekend Harvey's shout out, \"She hasn't won in 29 years!\" resonated. \n\n\n\nAn androgynous driver named Monica greeted me at the airport in a black tuxedo that would make Albert Nobbs weep for joy, prompting me to devilishly think of her as \"Nobbs\" all weekend.  She barely recognized me sporting a new Sally Hershberger hairdo, \"the yenta with the dragon tattoo.\"\n\n\n\nChecking into the Beverly Hills Hotel I bumped into best actress nominee, Golden Globe and Spirit Award winner Michelle Williams with her daughter Matilda Ledger headed to the swimming pool. Innocently standing there with no makeup she was remarkably the antithesis of Marilyn Monroe.  I told her she so deserved the Oscar for her mesmerizing transformation which did not cheer her up knowing the gold was going to Viola or Meryl.\n\n\n\nThis year there seemed to be more parties than ever. Vanity Fair publisher Edward Menicheschi  staged a staggering six nights of “CAMPAIGN HOLLYWOOD.” Ermenegildo Zenga and Colin and Livia Firth hosted an intimate dinner at the Chateau Marmont to benefit Oxfam America, Colin’s pet charity.  Editor Graydon Carter and Edward greeted Cameron Diaz, Kristin Davis, Gary and Alexandra Oldman, Mia Wasikowska.  In addition, Livia spoke about her 'Green Carpet Challenge' which uses eco-friendly fabrics for “wear it once” gowns at awards shows. Get it?  Go green on red. \n\n\n\nIt was a busy night at the Chateau as French billionaire investor Nicolas Berggruen hosted his party for young, leggy, breathtakingly beautiful models. Lindsay Lohan was on the loose after a judge having announced she was making great progress. She showed up sober wearing a new face bloated with injectable Restalyne that could only be preparation to portray Elizabeth Taylor in \"Liz and Dick\", her film for Lifetime. Peter Brant and Stephanie Seymour and Peter Morton and Linda Evangelista joined Josh Harnett and Emile Hirsh under the terrace heaters. The boys were looking for love in all the right places.\n\n\n\nThursday, February 23\n\n\n\nThursday night boasted fifteen events causing party panic.  Here is a brief rundown of seven.\n\n\n\nAt The Hollywood Reporters Nominees Night, editor Janice Min and publisher Lynne Segall greeted the power brokers. With ballots in, competing studios cordially mingled in the mayor’s backyard.  Owen Wilson slipped in the back door and hung with     Michael Sheen and producer Letty Aronson.  Producers Kathy Kennedy and Frank Marshall chatted with DreamWorks partner Stacey Snyder, producer Graham King and Emily Mortimer.  Fox's Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos compared notes with Focus's James Shamus.     Young directors Drake Doremus (\"Like Crazy\"), Sean Durkin (\"Martha Marcy May Marlene\") and Oscar nominee and Spirit Award winner J.C. Chandor (\"Margin Call\") drank at the bar. Breakout directors Nick Jarecki (\"Arbitrage\"), Zal Batmanglij (\"Sound of My Voice and \"The East\") and Jay Duplass (\"Jeff Who Lives at Home\") dreamed about their future nominations.    Aaron Sorkin, Piers Morgan and Lawrence O'Donnell handicapped Romney vs. Obama as     Brooklyn Decker sashayed by.\n\n\n\nUrs Fisher's exhibition Beds & Problem Paintings featured two bed sculptures at Larry Gagosian's Gallery followed by his private dinner at Mr. Chow's. Art lovers Vera Wang, Russell Simmons, Steve Martin, Jean Pigozzi and John Waters attended.\n\n\n\nThe US-Ireland Alliance honored nominees \"Hugo\" screenwriter John Logan, \"Bridesmaids\" star Melissa McCarthy and Michelle Williams at Bad Robot. Logan also wrote \"Rango”  \"Coriolanus\", 007’s \"Skyfall\" and \"Jersey Boys\" for the big screen.\n\n\n\nAlfre Woodard hosted a down and dirty girls night out in a rented house above Sunset for Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. \n\n\n\nUniversal honcho Ron Meyer hosted a civilized private buffet at his Malibu home for Graydon Carter with Tom Cruise, Leonardo DiCaprio, Barbra Streisand, Tom Hanks and Michael Douglas.\n\n\n\nStunning socialite Betsey Bloomingdale gave a seated dinner at her Holmby Hills home for best friends Nancy Reagan, Wendy Stark, Bob Colacello, Joan Collins and fashion icon Lynn Wyatt.\n\n\n\nTobias Meyer, auctioneer for Sotheby’s and art dealer Mark Fletcher hosted an open house at their Mulholland Drive home for English avant garde photographer Terry Richardson.  This is the only pre-Oscar party where a guest dropped his pants and mooned the red carpet and Terry signed a fans breast. Art collectors Bill and Maria Bell,         Todd Eberle, rock singer Jack Donahue and Francesco Clemente             ____schmoozed.\n\n\n\nFriday, February 24\n\n\n\nAt the BHH I ran into David Heyman, English producer of the \"Harry Potter\" franchise who was honored at the Publicists Awards lunch at The Beverly Hilton.  “Motion Picture Showman of the Year” was the consolation prize for being snubbed by the Academy for visualizing a publishing miracle for children around the world.\n\n\n\n“Nobbs” whisked me off to the     British Film Reception hosted by Jeremy Hunt, UK Secretary for Culture and Olympics,        and the British Consul-General Dame Barbara Hay, in her Hancock Park residence. Upon introduction, I blurted out that my friend Lord Astor, was interested in having LA people get to know his son-in-law, Prime Minister David Cameron. As an appointed diplomat she was horrified by my indiscretion and turned to greet the next American idiot. I was just making conversation.\n\n\n\nDaldry told Sony’s Sir Howard Stringer and astute film CEO Michael Lynton, Kenneth Branagh, Janet McTeer, and Gary Oldman    that he, as executive producer of the Olympics, was headed        back to London to oversee      special events, including the opening ceremony, directed by Danny Boyle. \n\n\n\nVictoria Beckham made a dramatic sullen last-minute appearance looking perfectly skinny in her own designed dress.\n\n\n\nAt the Women in Film party at Cecconi's,      Gwyneth Paltrow,  Shailene Woodley, Selena Gomez       and Vanessa Hudgens networked with Jessica, Octavia and Viola now of social stamina fame.\n\n\n\nBlythe Danner kissed me at the door as a military type looked on. I kept saying to him, \"Where have we met?\" Nowhere. He was astronaut Mark E. Kelly who came with Blythe and is married to former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, Paltrow's second cousin.  Only I could mistake an astronaut for a movie marketing guy. \n\n \n\nVanity Fair feted Scorsese and The Film Foundation which has saved 555 films in 22 years. Cocktails were at the restored Bel-Air Hotel. Honorary Jewess Lorraine Bracco ran past me yelling she was late for Ronald Perelman's Shabbat dinner. Three, three-time Oscar winners: composer Howard Shore, costume designer Sandy Powell and editor Thelma Schoonmaker were honored. Sir Ben Kingsley, Danny Huston, Patty Clarkson, Irwin Winkler and Giorgio Armani's niece Roberta Armani with Wanda McDaniels debated best director: Marty or Michel?\n\n\n\n“Nobbs” delivered me to WME's Party at kahuna Ari Emanuel's Brentwood estate, where NFL quarterback and new client Tim Tebow was the toast of the party, especially to Taylor Swift who made $35.7 million this year. Michael Douglas gave me a kiss…doesn’t get any better.        Lovebirds Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart made a     rare appearance, glued to each other's hips. They mingled with co-star Taylor Lautner, Miley Cyrus and her \"Hunger Games\" beau Liam Hemsworth.  Meanwhile Charlize Theron, Jack Black, Rooney Mara, Ben Stiller, Barry Sonnenfeld and Larry David talked business with moguls       Les Moonves and Viacom's Philippe Dauman.\n\n\n\nNext was UTA Chairman Jim Berkus' soiree that police almost shut down because the DJ got carried away impressing Harrison Ford, Channing Tatum, Jerry Bruckheimer, Tom Freston, Disney's Rich Ross, SNL's Lorne Michaels and Oscar show producer Brian Grazer.\n\n\n\nSunset Tower Hotel owner Jeff Klein and producer John Goldwyn hosted a secretive dinner for Anna and Graydon Carter at their Hollywood Hills home with Tom Ford, Mitch Glazer,    Fran Lebowitz, Vito Schnabel, Denise Hale, Lisa and Eric Eisner and VF's Punch Hutton, who is Tim Hutton's sister.  _____   \n\n\n\nLast stop was CAA Byran Lourd's \"Friday Night Party\". “Nobbs” was instructed to drop me off at a neighborhood school where a luxury van transported guests to the stone and glass Bel-Air estate situated on a narrow street. I knew that guests    Colin Firth, Penelope Cruz, Sofia Vergara, Salma Hayek, Sandra Bullock, and Glee's Matthew Morrison did not arrive by bus. Once inside the playing field leveled out and pound for pound there was more famous flesh per square inch than at the Oscars themselves. \n\n\n\nI huddled with Meryl on the couch and we talked about her race. She thought Viola. I thought Meryl. She didn't know about Harvey’s last minute \"29 year\" shout out.  \n\n\n\nI hugged Bette Midler,    flirted with Jim Sturgess and Bennett Miller.      Universal's Donna Langley, who is overseeing Tom Hooper's production \"Les Miserable\" mentioned Hugh Jackman's impeccable manners should insure best behavior from Russell Crowe. \n\n\n\nI introduced HBO’s \"Game Change\" director Jay Roach who is an authority on Hitler, to George Clooney who is writing a thriller about the Nazis stealing art. Clooney whispered, “The Frenchman is winning.”\n\n\n\nI thanked Bryan Lourd, Kevin Huvane and Richard Lovett, got on the bus and prayed that I get invited back.\n\n\n\nSaturday, February 25\n\n\n\nI dragged my tired ass to the Academy, as foreign films aficionado Mark Johnson was conducting a symposium on the nominated films, which included Sony Classic’s “In Darkness” from Poland, \"Footnote\" from Israel and \"A Separation\" from Iran. Israeli and Iranian governments from the other side of the world monitored their directors as the Sony boys kept the peace.\n\n\n\nMichael and Tom Bernard invited me to the Independent Spirit Awards at the Santa Monica Pier.  Michael hosted his \"Take Shelter\" nominees Jessica Chastain, Michael Shannon and director Jeff Nichols.  Tom held court      at the next table with the entire Iranian cast of \"A Separation\", which won.  Tom almost had a heart attack     when I threw my arms around Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, which in Iran is unacceptable behavior especially by a Jewish American Princess.  Tom wished I had gone to the crowded champagne brunch in honor of Prince Albert and Princess Charlene at the Bel-Air Hotel where Montblanc launched Grace Kelly watches. Simultaneously, TV producer Gary Pudney hosted another secretive lunch which Albert and Charlene actually attended with Graydon Carter, Carolina Herrera, Wallace Annenberg, Bobby Shriver, Bobby Marx, Kathy and Ricky Hilton and Lynn Wyatt. Wolfgang Puck joined them for dessert. \n\n\n\n\"The French,\" as the \"The Artist\" gang was nicknamed, had won six Cesars, France's version of the Oscars in Paris the night before. They flew all night and Harvey's chauffeur arranged a police escort from LAX just in time for them to win four Spirit Awards, cementing the Oscar win. \n\n\n\nBack at the BHH, Spielberg was the first to arrive at the tenth annual \"Night Before\" fundraiser in support of the Motion Picture and Television Fund. Jeffrey Katzenberg had already secured $200 of a $350 million fundraising goal that included money from him, Tom Cruise, Steve Bing, Casey Wasserman, Clooney and Spielberg. Every nominee showed up.\n\n\n\nChanel and Charles Finch cooked up their chic soiree at Madeo, where a mariachi band enthusiastically announced everyone's arrival.  Bedecked exclusively in Chanel were Diane Kruger, Rose Byrne, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Rachel Bilson      .  Also air kissing were Rachel Zoe, Rosanna Arquette, Alice Evans and Ioan Gruffudd, Zachary Quinto, and Julia Ormond.\n\n\n\nElizabeth Olsen who has six upcoming films, gushed to Dustin Hoffman that \"Wag the Dog\" was her favorite movie.  I sat next to director, Michael Apted who was editing “Of Men and Mavericks,” a surfer film he co-directed with Curtis Hanson. \n\n\n\n“My Week With Marilyn’s” English director Simon Curtis insisted we join Kenneth Branagh at The Weinstein Company’s bash at the Soho House in time to hear Tony Bennett sing “Autumn Leaves” to Harvey’s surprised 86 year-old mother Miriam, Madonna and Meryl. Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo, Michel Hazanavicius and producer Thomas Langmann staggered around completely jet lagged and too tired to speak English     . Uggie on the other hand was the absolute star of the evening as his trainer placed him in everyone’s arms for photo two shots. “W.E’s” Andrea Riseborough and Abbie Cornish sat next to baseball cap-clad Leonardo DiCaprio as his ex Bar Refaeli kept her distance across the room. Zoe Saldana walked in holding hands with Bradley Cooper. Scarlett Johansson introduced me to her boyfriend Nate Naylor. Katy Perry, Felicity Jones and Malin Akerman circled a refreshed Gerard Butler.  The two daughters of New York slain hero cop Peter Figoski, Corrine, 14 and Caroline, 16  who had also been Harvey’s guests at the Super Bowl stood in the middle of this circus and just fainted.\n\n\n\nSunday, February 26\n\n\n\nI met interior designer Nicky Haslam in the Polo Lounge and found Nancy Reagan brunching with Bob Colacello and Carolina Herrera.  Nancy knows me as “The DVD Lady.” I promised to send her “The Iron Lady”.  I didn’t have the heart to tell her that her husband, who was Margaret Thatcher’s best friend, was barely mentioned in the film. \n\n\n\nIn a Marchesa gown, Dennis Basso fur and Iradj Moini necklace,    I collected Simon Curtis and headed to the Hollywood & Highland Center. Simon, who has never been to the Oscars before, miraculously scored a front row seat between Michelle Williams and Clooney.  We pulled up to screams of hysteria at the mother of all red carpets.        We ended up in front of thousands of cameras and I instructed Simon to take baby steps for an hour. \n\n\n\nMeryl’s publicist Leslee Dart whispered to me. “She is dressed like an Oscar. What do we do if she loses?” Sacha Baron Cohen hilariously guilted the Academy into letting him wear his costume from “The Dictator” and after soiling Ryan Seacrest he went directly to dinner at Vanity Fair. Gwyeneth Paltrow won the style award in Tom Ford’s white column and Angelina Jolie so successfully invented a new one legged pose in a thigh high slit gown on the red carpet she repeated it for 39.3 million people onstage. \n\nTickets were so tight that I gave my plus one to Penelope Ann Miller because she promoted “The Artist” every day for four months. Seated next to us were co-stars James Cromwell and Missi Pyle. \n\n\n\nBilly Crystal made us laugh, Cirque de Soleil made us gasp and most of the wins were expected.        \n\nColin Firth crowned Meryl her third win on a record 17 nominations and Harvey beamed.  ______\n\n\n\nThe Academy was so confident \"The Artist\" would win; they invited Uggie, who waited in the wings and ran out as Tom Cruise announced the film.  \n\n\n\nOnce the show was off the air, I followed my seatmates to the stage loaded with their programs,    wraps and handbags and led the French to the press rooms. \n\n\n\nThe Governor's Ball was the next stop where the winners got their Oscars engraved. Everyone paid respects to the Academy’s Tom Sherak and Dawn Hudson.    Stars headed to the Sunset Tower to Graydon’s glittering Vanity Fair Oscar bash and their militarized security with micro chipped cards.  If your name was not on the list and you were carrying an Oscar, you could walk in.  Billy and Janice Crystal were mobbed with well-wishers. Elton John made $5 million dollars at his 20th AmFar event which also auctioned off two tickets to Vanity Fair’s party    for $230 thousand dollars. Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes were thrilled to talk to George Lucas. Gwyneth snuggled with Coldplay's Chris Martin and Jennifer Lopez brought boy-toy Casper Smart. Every major actor previously mentioned was standing in the room.     In a sea of celebrity were Tina Fey, David Beckham, Glenn Close,       Terry George, Demian Bichir, Claire Danes, Meryl's daughters Mamie Gummer with husband Ben Walker,   Grace Gummer, Salma Hayek, Brit Marling, Natalie Portman, Sofia Coppola, Ryan Kavanaugh, Ingrid Sischy, Sandy Brant and Wendi Murdoch with Bingbing Li.    \n\n\n\n\nGeorge Clooney threw his own exclusive    party at Craig's in West Hollywood for close friends Bryan Lourd, Grant Heslov, Stan Rosenfield, Brad and Angelina, Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, Cindy Crawford, Jimmy Kimmel, Ryan Seacrest and best adapted screenplay winner Alexander Payne.  As much as George supported \"The Descendants\" he and Brad seemed to have cancelled each other out this year with two great performances.\n\n\n\n“The French” and their closest 200 threw their own wild celebration at the Chateau, poured champagne down their throats and threw each other in the pool at 3:00am. Nobody spoke a word of English.\n\n\n\nBy 4:00am Harvey rounded his talent up for a live broadcast on \"The Today Show\" from The Four Seasons lobby. In disheveled black tie five Oscar winners and Berenice Bejo, who were total unknowns a year ago made Oscar history with the first silent film to win since 1927.  This had to be the most exciting night of their lives. Tomorrow they all go back to reality but the glory and the memories will live on forever. As an Oscar winner, who cares about a cold?  \n\n\n\nUggie was invited to the White House correspondent’s dinner as a guest of the Washington Times in April.

The students played that role in the simulation\nand learned how economics is used in the real world.\n\nAll of this is really beside the point, however. I learned, during\nthese conversations, that at Columbia calculus is required in order to\nbe an economics major. I wondered about this, since the courses we\nwere building never had any complicated math in them, so it seemed\nthat calculus wasn’t something that came up regularly in real-world\neconomics.\n\nI asked and was told that my observation was right and that cal-\nculus was required in order to ensure that there wouldn’t be too many\neconomics majors. As an insider in the university world, I understood\nthis remark, but it needs some explaining for outsiders.\n\nColumbia doesn’t have an undergraduate business major. And, in\nNew York City there are a lot of students interested in business. Colum-\nbia and other Ivy League schools think that business isn’t an academic\nsubject, so students shouldn’t learn it until they go to graduate school.\nColumbia does have a well-respected business school, but, as I pointed\nout, no one really wants to teach undergraduates so they certainly\naren’t lobbying to teach them. (This is also true of medical schools and\nlaw schools and it is why you never see courses for undergraduates in\nthose fields despite the evident interest of the undergraduates.)\n\nSo, potential businesspeople at Columbia need to major in some-\nthing and economics seems to them to be a reasonable second choice.\n(I am not really sure that it is a good choice but these are 18-year-olds\nmaking these decisions.) Thus, the Economics Department is flood-\ned with potential majors. This seems like it would be a good thing,\ndoesn’t it? Students want to study what you teach. Isn’t that good?\n\nWell, not really.\n\nLet us assume we have an economics faculty of 20 people, each of\nwhom teaches three courses a year. So we can offer 60 courses. Sounds\nlike a good number. But this has to include graduate seminars, and\nthe faculty will be lobbying to have more of these and more advanced\ncourses where they can teach their own specialty, as I have said. But\nmajors need courses too. They might need 20 or more. This doesn’t\nleave a lot for introductory courses unless the department runs enor-\nmous lecture courses that have hundreds of students. Now depart-\nments know that such courses are pretty awful things and they try to\nkeep them down to a dull roar.

It was seen as deeply symbolic, signifying Jews\nfinally taking control of their own destiny. It was a message that took on an\neven greater power and poignancy after the mass murder of the Jews of Europe\nduring the Holocaust.\n\nEven for many Israelis nowadays, the all-consuming collectivism of life on\nan early kibbutz, and the physical challenges, are hard to imagine. Among the\nfew dozen families in Mishmar Hasharon when I was born, there was no private\nproperty. Everything was communally owned and allocated. Every penny — or\nIsraeli pound — earned from what we produced went into a communal kitty,\nfrom which each one of the 150-or-so families in Mishmar Hasharon when I\nwas a child got a small weekly allowance. By “small”, I mean tiny. For my\nparents and others, even the idea of an ice cream cone for their children was a\nmatter of keen financial planning. More often, they would save each weekly\npittance with the aim of pooling them at birthday time, where they might stretch\nto the price of a picture book, or a small toy.\n\nDecisions on any issue of importance were taken at the aseifa, the weekly\nmeeting of kibbutz members held on Saturday nights in our dining hall. The\nagenda would be tacked up on the wall the day before, and the session would\nusually focus on one issue, ranging from major items like the kibbutz’s finances\nto the question, for instance, of whether our small platoon of delivery drivers\nshould be given pocket money to buy a sandwich or a coffee on their days\noutside the kibbutz or be limited to wrapping up bits of the modest fare on offer\nat breakfast time. That debate ended in a classic compromise: a bit of money,\nbut very little, so as to avoid violating the egalitarian ethos of the kibbutz.\n\nBut perhaps the aspect of life on the kibbutz most difficult for outsiders to\nunderstand, especially nowadays, is that we children were raised collectively.\nWe lived in dormitories, organized by age-group and overseen by a caregiver:\nin Hebrew, a metapelet, usually a woman in her 20s or 30s. For a few hours\neach afternoon and on the Jewish Sabbath, we were with our parents. But\notherwise, we lived and learned in a world consisting almost entirely of other\nchildren.\n\nEverything around us was geared towards making us feel like a band of\nbrothers and sisters, and as part of the guiding spirit of the kibbutz. Until our\nteenage years, we weren’t even graded in school. And though we didn’t actually\nstudy how to till the land, some of my fondest early memories are of our\n“children’s farm” — the vegetables we grew, the cows we milked, the hens and\nchickens that gave us our first experience of how life was created.

Finally, the\ncourt reasoned that the “interest of the\nUnited States in preventing and punishing\ninternational terrorism has been a matter\nof worldwide common knowledge for\nyears.” Jd. (citing statutes criminalizing\nterrorist acts). “It logically follows that if\nfederal courts may constitutionally exer-\ncise criminal jurisdiction over such individ-\nuals, the Constitution should be no bar to\nthose same federal courts, in a civil action\n\n. exercising civil im personam jurisdic-\ntion over those same individuals for the\nsame acts.” Id.\n\n[44] The courts in Rein, Daltberti, and\nPugh properly exercised personal jurisdic-\ntion over each of the defendants in those\ncases pursuant to the FSIA, which specifi-\ncally provides that personal jurisdiction ex-\nists where proper service and subject mat-\nter jurisdiction have been established. 28\nU.S.C. § 1830(b); Rein, 995 F.Supp. at\n329-30; Daliberti, 97 F.Supp.2d at 52;\nPugh, 290 F.Supp.2d at 58. While the\nFSIA is not the basis for personal jurisdic-\ntion here, jurisdiction based on the ATA or\nRule 4(k)(2) also requires minimum con-\ntacts with the United States. Accordingly,\nPlaintiffs may rely on their “purposefully\ndirected” theory to establish these mini-\nmum contacts. But as existed in Burger\nKing, Calder, and the three terrorism\ncases, Plaintiffs must allege some personal\nor direct involvement by the Defendants in\nthe conduct giving rise to their claims.\nSee, eg. Daliberti, 97 F.Supp.2d at 41\n(explaining that defendant Iraq had held\nand tortured plaintiffs and that three of\nfour plaintiffs were released only after\nU.S. officials’ explicit negotiations with\ntheir Iraqi counterparts); Pugh, 290\nF.Supp.2d at 56 (noting that seven individ-\nual Libyan defendants were sued in the\nUnited States after extensive official\nFrench investigation and that these defen-\ndants were deemed to be responsible for\n\nthe bombings in both civil and criminal\nproceedings); see also In re Magnetic Au-\ndiotape, 334 F.3d at 208 (2d (stating a\n“court may exercise personal jurisdiction\nover defendant consistent with due process\nwhen defendant is primary participant in\nintentional wrongdoing—albeit extraterri-\ntorially—expressly directed at forum”)\n(citing Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. at 789-90,\n104 S.Ct. 1482)); Time, Inc. v. Sumpson,\nNo. 02 Civ. 49170MBM), 2003 WL\n23018890, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 22, 2003)\n(finding Calder turned on “personal in-\nvolvement of the individual defendants in\nthe particular conduct that gave rise to the\nplaintiffs claim” and granting motion to\ndismiss because plaintiff had not demon-\nstrated that defendant had had any per-\nsonal involvement in the events giving rise\nto the lawsuit). Accordingly, regardless of\nwhether personal jurisdiction is based on\nthe ATA’s nationwide service of process\nprovision or Rule 4(k)@), to satisfy the\nFifth Amendment’s due process require-\nments, Plaintiffs must make a prima facie\nshowing of each Defendant’s personal or\ndirect participation in the conduct giving\nrise to Plaintiffs’ injuries.\n\n3. Mass Torts Theory\n\n[45] In addition to the arguments ar-\nticulated above, the Federal Plaintiffs sub-\nmit that the Court should utilize a modi-\nfied due process standard appropriate for\nmass torts. See, e.g., Federal Prince Turki\nOpp. at 23; Federal Prince Mohammed\nOpp. at 12; SAAR Network Opp. at 12-13.\nCourts in the Eastern District of New\nYork have outlined the modified standard\nin products liability cases as follows: the\nstate’s interests in the litigation replace\ncontacts with the forum as the constitu-\ntional touchstone and the “reasonableness”\ninquiry is replaced with a hardship analy-\nsis.

Similarly, individuals\nwith fewer social connections (i.e., a\nsmaller social network) were less likely\nto be physically active, but the effects of\nloneliness on physical activity did not\ndepend on the size of the social network.\nThe invisible force of loneliness seems\nto play a unique role in this particular\npredisease pathway.\n\nAnother commonly cited risk\nfactor for disease is stress. In reality,\n“stress” refers to a family of predisease\npathways, each of which may be\nvulnerable to the influence of lonely\nfeelings. Loneliness is itself a source of\nstress, but lonely individuals also differ\nin their exposure to stressful events and\ncircumstances. This is less evident in\nyoung adults than it is in older adults in\nwhom loneliness was associated with\nhaving experienced a greater number of\nstressful life events in the past year (e.g.,\ndeath in the family, marital crisis,\nchange in employment status) and more\nsources of chronic stress (e.g.,\nemployment stress, marital stress).° In\naddition, lonely individuals perceive life\nas more stressful and less gratifying than\ntheir socially connected counterparts,\neven when objective indications are that\nlonely and nonlonely individuals do not\ndiffer in the types of activities and\nbehaviors they engage in on a daily\nbasis. Good quality social interactions\ntypically ameliorate feelings of stress,\nbut because lonely people perceive their\ninteractions to be less positive than those\nof nonlonely people, they fail to derive\nthe same benefit. Good coping strategies\ncan also ameliorate feelings of stress, but\nlonely individuals are more likely to\nrespond to stress with pessimism and\navoidance than with optimism and active\n\nPage |43\n\nengagement. And to add insult to injury,\nloneliness increases sensitivity to and\nsurveillance for social threats. Anxiety,\nlow self-esteem, and fear of negative\nevaluation elicit self-defensive behaviors\nand effectively tax cognitive resources\nthat would normally be available to meet\nthe demands of daily life stress. Thus,\nwhat might naively be thought of as a\ncircumscribed problem—the feeling of\nloneliness and isolation—may be seen\nby the sufferer as a world of inescapable\nthreat.’\n\nHow might these cognitions and\nperceptions influence physiology and\nhealth? As Berntson shows in his\nchapter, the brain regions involved in\nemotional and perceptual processes are\nintimately related to brain regions\ninvolved in the regulation of\nphysiological systems. This is\nparticularly evident in alterations of the\nfunctioning of the cardiovascular system\nin lonely individuals. In young adults,\nthis alteration is apparent in increased\nresistance to blood flow in small arteries\nthroughout the body. Increased vascular\nresistance is a precursor and\npredominant contributor to age-related\nincreases in systolic blood pressure\n(SBP), a major risk factor for\ncardiovascular disease. In middle-aged\nadults, SBP is significantly higher in\nlonely adults than in their nonlonely\ncounterparts. Moreover, loneliness\naccelerates the rate of increases in SBP,*\nindicating a faster decline in\nphysiological resilience and a heightened\nrisk for chronic cardiovascular disease.\nIt’s as though loneliness accelerates the\naging process.\n\nBy virtue of extensive\ninterconnections among the brain,\nperipheral nervous systems, and\nendocrine glands, the feelings of\nisolation and loneliness have a broad and\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021289\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Whether the idea has to do with politics, policy, \npersonnel or governing style, we're looking for suggestions that are specific and, above all, surprising; something inventive if \nslightly far-fetched is better than a pet cause or a well-trod policy proposal. (This exercise doesn't require that you support or \neven agree with Trump, but it does require a willingness to engage.) \nDo you have an idea along these lines that you wish the new president would consider, whether something in economics or \notherwise? If so, I'd love to hear, and we can discuss next steps from there. Ultimately, we're aiming to publish a handful of \nshort pieces (about 800 words each) as a package of proposals. \nMany thanks, and please let me know if you have questions. \nMargy Slattery \nDeputy Editor, Politico Magazine \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029084 \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

So begins an appetite for violence, one that can turn into a craving.\n\nA craving to impress\n\nGazelles on the Serengeti plains of Tanzania sometimes move in an exceptionally bizarre way. With legs\nrigidly extended, they bounce up and down like kangaroos. There is no obvious function associated with\nthis movement. If anything, it appears energetically wasteful. If these gazelles lived in tall grass, one\nmight think that the bouncing was designed to better see or be seen. But the Serengeti plains are flat and\nthe grass is short. Gazelles can see for miles in this habitat and so can everything else that shares this\ngorgeous part of the planet with them. This includes the lions, leopards and cheetah that think of gazelles\nas breakfast, lunch and dinner. Why would a gazelle advertise like this? Why alert predators to your\nlocation and availability? Why not use the coloration of your fur to blend into the color scheme of the\nsavannah, moving swiftly but imperceptibly?\n\nWe can explain the gazelle’s bizarre movements — called stotting — by thinking economically,\nusing Zahavi’s honest signaling theory that I described in Chapter 1. Whenever evolutionary biologists\nsee a behavior that is costly, they immediately search for a potential benefit. The reason is simple:\nbehaviors that tax an individual's chances of survival and reproduction are ultimately weeded out by the\nforce of natural selection. There must be some benefit to the individual or to others in order to neutralize\nthe costs. Given the ostentatious nature of the gazelle’s stotting, who benefits and how? Since the\nbehavior is eye-poppingly interesting to human observers, one assumes that it is eye-popping to other\nanimals on the Serengeti plains as well. Gazelles typically stot when they detect danger which, in the\nSerengeti, means leopards, lions and cheetah. If gazelles stot to alert other gazelles, then most gazelles\nshould stot, at least some of the time. This is because all gazelles are vigilant, should have multiple\nopportunities to see these predatory cats, and should benefit from an alarm signal. But this is not what we\nobserve. Instead, stotting seems to be reserved for those in good shape. When gazelles stot, they appear to\nbe sending a cease and desist signal to any observant cat. If this is the gazelles’ message, then cats should\nselectively chase non-stotters over stotters. And when cats turn a blind eye to stotting gazelles and chase\nthem, they should have less success than when they chase non-stotters. Stotters are turbo-charged.\nStotting is simply their way of showing off.\n\nThese expectations are supported by the British biologists Claire Fitzgibbon and Tim Caro who\nspent hundreds of hours watching gazelles and predatory cats. What they reveal is that stotting is an\n\nhonest signal of condition or quality. Only gazelles in good condition can tolerate the costs of stotting.\n\nHauser Chapter 2.

Once the medical team removed the bullet fragments and\ncleared the blood clot, the man was able to speak. He had shot himself, aiming at his second head. Yes,\nhis second head. This man believed that he had two heads, his own and the head of his dead wife’s\ngynecologist. Before his wife died in a car accident, he believed that she was having an affair with her\ngynecologist. At night, the second head spoke, accompanied by voices from Jesus and Abraham who\nconfirmed the existence of the second head. As the patient expressed to the interviewing doctor “The\nother head kept trying to dominate my normal head, and I would not let it. It kept trying to say to me I\nwould lose, and I said bull-shit.” “I am the king pin here” it said and it kept going on like that for about\nthree weeks and finally I got jack of it, and I decided to shoot my other head off.” Over a two year period,\nthe perception of the second head disappeared. The attending neuropsychologist, David Ames, described\nthe case as an example of schizophrenia-induced delusional bicephaly — a distortion of reality that\ncreates a false belief of two heads.\n\nCases like this are bizarre. But like many neuropsychological reports, they force us to reevaluate\nour perception of reality, what’s normal and what’s distorted, what’s adaptive and what’s maladaptive.\nThe Australian patient who developed delusional bicephaly was suffering from the loss of his wife. Loss\nand suffering motivate explanation, along with something or someone to blame: Was it really an\naccident? Why her? Why not me? What if she had stayed home that morning? What if I had been driving\nwith her? Was she distracted by her lover? Was he in the car?

A week ago, the 55-year-old investment banker began serving 18 months in jail.\n\nBut that plea deal - guilty of felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring a person under the age of 18 for\nprostitution - does not account for all five of the girls, one as young as 14, who alleged that Epstein sexually\nabused them. And why is Epstein serving his term in the overcrowded Palm Beach County Jail and not a state\nprison, where inmates are sent if their sentences are longer than one year?\n\nThe slow, dissatisfying resolution of the case sends a message to the public that there's a different system of\njustice for the wealthy who hire high-powered lawyers. Epstein's legal team included West Palm Beach defense\nattorney Jack Goldberger, Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz, who defended O.J. Simpson\nagainst murder charges, and Kenneth Starr, the prosecutor who pursued then-President Bill Clinton for lying\nabout sex with young women.\n\nPalm Beach police spent 11 months investigating Epstein before State Attorney Barry Krischer sent the case to\na grand jury, instead of charging Epstein so the man who once boasted of accepting only billionaire clients\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031217\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

During that initial online interview, my objective\nwas to stimulate the interest of the Emirati community in the Internet when the use of the online\ncommunications was relatively limited.\n\nToday the usage of the Internet across the UAE has come to be taken for granted; in fact, the Web has been\nadopted so extensively in both the public and private sectors that e-communications are the norm rather than the\nexception. We see that a large segment of our society, especially young people, believe that the Internet is the\nmost important source of information, education and entertainment.\n\nThe UAE continues to lead the Arab world in adoption of information and communication technology\naccording to the annual global infor mation technology report released before yesterday.\n\nLittle wonder, then, that I get inundated with questions from citizens and media alike. That’s why I have chosen\nto meet with you via my Web site. I think hosting this encounter online will allow all of you to ask as many\nquestions as you wish. In the last few days alone, I have received hundreds of questions from several local and\nregional newspapers. Naturally, there was some overlapping of questions since they came from so many\ndifferent sources. Hence, I have tried to consolidate my answers in such a manner that I do not come across as\nrepetitious.\n\nThis “interview,” of course, relates to questions from the media, whose work I consider especially significant in\ntelling the story of how Dubai and the UAE are coping successfully with the global financial crisis, and how our\ndevelopment plans are being advanced with the resilience and determination that has always characterized\nEmirati society.\n\nI have also received many questions from everyday Emiratis, and these will be answered in a subsequent\ncommunication.\n\nIn the meantime, I hope my responses will generate positive discussion about the issues and values that Dubai\nand the UAE care about — the strengthening ofa society that’s anchored in unique Emirati traditions, and the\ncontinued building of a global city to which all are welcome, a city that is well integrated in the fast changing\nglobal commons that we all must share. Dubai is not only a catalyst of change; it is an exemplar of change. And\nI am proud of that, just as Iam proud of the economic and social contributions that Emiratis and their well-\nwishers have made over these years to furthering the Dubai Vision.\n\nAl Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi\n\nYour Highness, Dubai, the famous city known for its outstanding experience on both\nregional and international levels, has been recently criticized for its development\nstrategy in the light of the global financial crisis. How do you perceive this campaign and\nhow are you dealing with it?\n\nCriticism and negative statements do not really disturb me. We do not mind receiving objective criticism that\nhelps us improving our services and methods. If there were negative aspects, then we will address them and\nwork toward revamping them. But following the global financial crisis, what we read and heard was not in\nreference to the negative aspects. In fact it was a \"media bombardment\" targeted at the UAE as a model for a\nfederal state, a successful and prosperous Arab country. And Dubai, the city that has set up a successful\neconomic model at a global level, was under a daily attack by some Western media, as if they were in a race\nagainst time to harm the UAE.\n\nAs for the motives of the campaign, God Almighty knows.

They didn’t bother getting married until the summer of 1941. Perhaps\nbecause this was less than nine months before I was born, my mother always\nremained vague when asked their exact wedding date.\n\nMy parents were an unlikely pair. My mother — bright, lively and energetic —\nwas a doer, who believed passionately in the grand social experiment of kibbutz\nlife. Having helped her mother raise her siblings in Warsaw, and with a natural\naffinity from children, she became the main authority on issues related to\nchildbirth and early childcare. She actively partook in the kibbutz’s planning\nand politics, and reveled in its social life. My father was more detached both\npolitically and socially. He was more contemplative, less assertive, less self-\nconfident. Though he agreed broadly with the founding principles of the\nkibbutz, and wanted to play his role in making it a success, I could see, as I\ngrew older, that he was often impatient at what he saw as its intellectual\ninsularity and its ideological rigidities.\n\nThough it didn’t strike me at the time, he was not a large man. As a result of\nhis childhood illness, he never grew to more than five-foot-four. Still, he was a\npowerful presence, stocky and strong from his work on the kibbutz. He had a\ndeep, resonant voice and wise-looking, blue-gray eyes. It was only through\nUncle Meir that by the time I was born, he had moved on from driving a tractor\nto a more influential role on the kibbutz. Meir worked for the Palestine Electric\nCompany and when Mishmar Hasharon installed its own electricity system, the\nPEC was in charge of the work. Meir trained my father and put him forward as\nthe kibbutz contact for maintaining and repairing the equipment. He was well\nsuited for the work. He was a natural tinkerer, a problem-solver. He was good\nwith his hands, and his natural caution was an additional asset as the kibbutz got\nto grips with the potential, and the potential dangers, of electric power. Once the\nsystem was installed, he became responsible for managing any aspect of the\nsettlement that involved electricity: water pumps, the irrigation system, the\ncommunal laundry and our bakery.\n\nMy parents were courteous and polite with each other, but they never\nshowed any physical affection in our presence. None of the adults did. This was\npart of an unspoken kibbutz code. Not only for kibbutzniks, but for all the early\nZionists, outward displays of emotion were seen as a kind of selfishness that\nrisked undermining communal cohesion, tenacity and strength. Because I’d\nknown no other way, this did not strike me as odd. Besides, I was a quiet,\ncontemplative, bookish and self-contained child.

This would not necessarily make\nEgypt worse off, but it could further weaken the economy as revenue from\nkey industries, such as tourism, continues to decline. It would not improve\nconditions either, as improvements, unfortunately, take longer that the\nvoting public generally likes. The potential upshot of this option is that,\nhopefully, over time, mass action would become more and more cohesive\nand leaders start to emerge from the morass. This would bring developed\npolitical parties into Egypt’s political system and potentially, leaders from\noutside the military and the elite as well. This, however, will remain only a\ntemporary option. Revolutions, or even mass action, are difficult to\nmaintain over time. Moreover, if some improvements, particularly\neconomic improvements, do occur, the majority of the country will\nacquiesce to a nondemocratic government. The best example of this is the\nChinese government, which has managed economic growth without any\naccompanying political liberalization. Eventually, either a government\nwill improve conditions for the average Egyptian, or it will become so\nrepressive that mass action ceases to be a viable option. The third option is\na total crackdown on any and all political movements and the return of a\nrepressive and autocratic government. The impetus behind this path is the\nidea that establishing stability is the first and foremost priority of the\ngovernment. If you establish stability, the rest will follow. Or, if the\ngovernment is truly cynical, it simply does not care what happens as long\nas the ruler and his or her cronies are taken care of. Right now, it looks as\nthough Egypt has chosen to go with option three, the return to repression\nunder military rule. The first step for any autocracy is to get a firm grip on\nthe political process, weeding out the opposition. This is precisely what\n\nhas been occurring. Massive repression of the Muslim Brotherhood is the\nmost obvious example of this process. While there are some legitimate\n\nsecurity concerns regarding the Muslim Brotherhood ties to ongoing\nviolence, banning the entire organization and labeling them all as terrorists\nis like using a sledgehammer on a nail—overkill and likely to create a\nmess. It does, however, have the benefit of getting the only meaningful\npolitical party out of the current political scene and that is a key step in\npolitical consolidation.

Courts in the\nSecond Circuit seem to take the opposite\napproach. “Although cast in terms that\nmay be read to require that only the injury\nrather than the tortious acts occur in the\nUnited States, the Supreme Court has\nheld that this exception ‘covers only torts\noccurring within the territorial jurisdiction\nof the United States.” Cabiri v. Govt of\nthe Republic of Ghana, 165 F.3d 198, 200\nn. 3 (2d Cir.1999) (quoting Amerada Hess,\n488 U.S. at 441, 109 S.Ct. 683); see also\nArsh v.

Judge Robertson recognized the same diffi-\nculty. Although he did consider Plaintiffs’s\nclaims under the tort exception, he found that\nthe language of the state sponsor of terrorism\nexception buttressed his ultimate conclusion\nthat the tortious acts exception would not\nprovide subject matter jurisdiction over\nPrince Sultan and Prince Turki. Unlike\n(a)(7), the tort exception “makes no mention\nof the ‘provision of material support.’”’ Bur-\nnett IT, 292 F.Supp.2d at 20 n. 5.

Plaintiffs also claim that, in\nreturn for protection of the Kingdom,\nthese Defendants essentially willfully ig-\nnored the threat that Osama bin Laden\nand al Qaeda posed to the United States.\nPlaintiffs do not claim that the Kingdom or\nthe Princes undertook any of their alleged\nacts in the United States. Yet, in the\nPlaintiffs’ view, the operative torts for the\nCourt’s consideration are the attacks of\nSeptember 11, which did take place in the\nUnited States. See Burnett If, 292\nF.Supp.2d at 19 n. 4 (noting death and\ninjuries occurred in United States). Fur-\nther, Plaintiffs claim it would be unjust to\nallow foreign nations to escape liability for\ntortious acts performed in the United\nStates if they could show that some act of\nplanning the tort took place outside the\nUnited States.\n\nAdditionally, Defendants submit that,\nsince the allegations are precisely those\noutlined in § 1605(a)(7)—that is, “personal\ninjury or death that was caused by an act\nof ... extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabo-\ntage ... or the provision of material sup-\nport or resources ... for such an act?—\nnone of the other exceptions should be\nread to apply in its place.” Defendants\n\nincludes particular language in one section of\na statute but omits it from another, Judge\nRobertson concluded that Congress’s omis-\nsion of ‘provision of material support’ from\n(a)(5) should be treated as intentional.

For his part, the Kazakh leader wants to make sure that the Americans stay out \nof the dispute, and not allow it to affect their alliance with his government. \nThe Obama administration has done just that.

Human rights activists, however, have \nlong accused him of persecuting dissidents and political opponents. \nMr. Aliyev, 48, [*]has served as chief of the tax police, deputy foreign affairs minister and head of the \nKazakh equivalent of the K.G.B. But critics say he used his clout to secretly take over private companies for \nfinancial gain, often by threatening violence. \nNow hiding somewhere in Europe, he has been convicted back home on what he claims are trumped-up \ncriminal charges, including a coup attempt. His wife divorced him in June 2007, and the Kazakh government \nhas taken businesses owned by him and members of his extended family. [*] \nNo longer powerful at home, Mr. Aliyev turned to Washington, knowing that his former father-in-law cared \ngreatly about his reputation there. \nEarly in 2008 he hired RJI Government Strategies, a small Washington lobbying group whos \ne consultants \nincluded Tanya Rahall, sister of Representative Nick J. Rahall II, a West Virginia Democrat; and a friend of \nRepresentative Darrell Issa, Republican of California. Both congressmen were booked on a trip to Kazakhstan \nto discuss energy policy with Mr. Nazarbayev. \nBefore their departure, members of___________________________to urge him to express strong concerns about the \nharm done to a relative of Mr. Aliyev named Devincci Hourani, whose oil-company assets in Kazakhstan \nwere seized, according to a letter to Mr. Issa from RJI. \nMr. Issa, who had developed a rapport with the Kazakh president on an earlier visit, nonetheless agreed to \ntake up the plight of Mr. Hourani. Though he stepped into the fight, he still maintained a close connection to \nthe president, nominating him that summer for the Nobel Prize, a move that drew ridicule from human rights \nactivists. [that's right, of Vista, CA] [*] \nMs. Rahall worked on behalf of Mr. Aliyev and later for Mr. Hourani through 2010, contacting the offices of \nat least two dozen members of Congress. They included Representative Howard L. Berman, Democrat of \nCalifornia, then chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, whose office said he discussed the dispute \nwith the State Department. \nMs. Rahall also pursued a second strategy. \"The alternative is to embarrass the existing regime,\" she wrote in \na July 2008 e-mail to her boss. \nShe pressed House members to criticize the Kazakh government's human rights record. At her request, at \nleast five statements were published in the Congressional Record, one citing Mr. Aliyev as a victim of his \ngovernment. Separately, Mr. Aliyev offered to provide the Justice Department with documents that he \nclaimed could prove that his former father-in-law accepted bribes from a businessman representing American \noil companies that were seeking drilling rights in Kazakhstan \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031153 \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

(Washington is an exception,\nhowever, and makes personal cultivation a felony unless it is done by a person registered in the state’s\nmedical marijuana database.) Unlike state medical cannabis laws, which may restrict the form of can-\nnabis products available, recreational laws permit production and sale of most common forms of can-\nnabis products, including a wide variety of flower, concentrates and infused products.\n\nState recreational laws designate state agencies to issue commercial cannabis licenses and regulate\nparticipants in the cannabis supply chain. Some of these agencies are newly established specifically to\nregulate cannabis, such as California's Bureau of Cannabis Control (BCC) or Massachusetts’s Cannabis\nControl Commission. Others are existing state agencies (and typically oversee tax or alcohol matters),\nsuch as Nevada’s Department of Taxation or Oregon’s Liquor Control Commission. These agencies\nalso may regulate state medical cannabis industries, as do Colorado’s Marijuana Enforcement Division,\nWashington’s Liquor and Cannabis Board and California's BCC.\n\nState regulatory agencies issue separate licenses for different types of commercial cannabis activities.\nCommon categories of licenses include cultivation, production, manufacturing, distribution, transpor-\ntation, laboratory testing and retail. A state may further provide for multiple types of licenses within a\ncategory. For example, California’s recreational law provides for 12 types of cultivation licenses, which\nvary according to factors such as the size of a cultivation facility and indoor or outdoor cultivation.\nMost states allow companies to hold licenses in multiple categories, thereby allowing vertically inte-\ngrated cultivation, manufacturing and retail businesses. Washington is an exception—in most cases, a\nbusiness is prohibited from holding licenses across categories. Even states that allow vertical integration\ntypically prohibit the holder of a laboratory testing license from holding licenses in other categories.\n\nState laws give significant power to counties and municipalities to impose zoning and permitting\nrequirements that may severely restrict or prohibit cannabis activities. California requires a state-license\napplicant to demonstrate it has all permits, licenses and approvals required under local law, and many\nCalifornia cities and counties have effectively banned the recreational cannabis industry. Massachu-\nsetts allows towns that voted “No” on the state’s recreational law to ban cannabis businesses through\nDecember 2019 and requires other towns that wish to prohibit cannabis businesses to do so through\na local ballot initiative.\n\nEach state has chosen to levy significant taxes on the recreational cannabis industry, and somestate laws\nauthorize local governments to levy additional cannabis-related taxes. Nevada imposes a 15% excise taxon\ncannabis wholesales by cultivators and a 10% excise tax on retail sales. Oregon and Massachusetts charge\na state excise tax of 17% and 10.75%, respectively, and each state authorizes local governments to levy up\nto another 3%. Washington originally imposed a 25% excise tax on cannabis sales at each of three different\npoints in the supply chain— grower to processor, processor to retailer and retailer to consumer—but now\ncharges a single 37% tax on retail sales. California imposes a 15% excise tax. All state and local cannabis-\nspecific excise taxes are in addition to normal state and local sales tax. Although the possibility of gen-\nerating significant tax revenue is one reason state governments have embraced legal cannabis, some\nproponents of legalization argue that high tax rates will keep consumer prices high and discourage\nconsumer transition to legalized markets.\n\n66 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024702\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Rev. 861, *885\n\nremains what the court should do with the victim's statement. Currently Rule 11(a)() specifies that the court must consider\n\"the parties views on a nolo plea - but it makes no mention of the victim's views. !4? The CVRA now mandates that victims\nmust be \"reasonably heard\" at any proceeding involving a \"plea.\" !>° It is hard to see how anyone could argue that a victim is\nreasonably heard when, after making a [*886] statement about the nolo plea, the court is not required to even consider it. The\nrule should be amended to require courts to consider victims’ statements.\n\nRule 11(b)(4) - Victims’ Right To Be Heard on Pleas\nThe Proposals:\n\nI proposed that the court should be required to address any victim present when a plea is taken to determine whether the victim\nwishes to make a statement and to consider the victim's view before accepting a plea, as follows:\n\nVictims’ Views. Before the court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or allows any plea to be withdrawn, the court must\naddress any victim who is present personally in open court. During this address, the court must determine whether the victim\nwishes to present views regarding the proposed plea or withdrawal and, if so, what those views are. The court shall consider the\nvictim's views in acting on the proposed plea or withdrawal. !*!\n\nThe Advisory Committee recommended no change to Rule 11. 1°?\nDiscussion:\n\nIt is hard to understand why the Advisory Committee declined to recommend changing Rule 11 to require that victims be\naddressed, as it did not discuss the idea. '*3 If the Advisory Committee deliberately rejected this idea, it has given no\nexplanation and it is hard to see any justification for the Advisory Committee's position. The CVRA gives victims \"the right to\nbe reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving ... [a] plea.\" '*4 To implement the victim's right to\nbe heard regarding a plea, my proposed rule change merely required the court to directly address any victim who is present in\ncourt and to consider any views the victim expressed. This is consistent with the CVRA's legislative history which explains that\n\"this provision is intended to allow crime victims to directly address the court in person.\" !5> The language of the proposed\nrule is lifted from an earlier paragraph in Rule 11, which requires the court \"before accepting a plea of guilty\" to \"address the\ndefendant personally in open court.\" !*° Victims should be treated evenhandedly with defendants. It may also be important for\nthe judge to address victims directly because many victims will lack [*887] the assistance of counsel. Untrained in legal\nproceedings, victims may be uncertain about exactly when in the process they should present their views. Having the court\naddress the victim will eliminate that uncertainty and ensure that the victim's right to be heard is vindicated.\n\nThe Advisory Committee's \"global\" rule on victims’ rights (Rule 60) does briefly address pleas. Tracking language in the\nCVRA, the Advisory Committee would require the court to \"permit a victim to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding ...\n\n49 The rule does mention that the court must consider \"the public interest in the effective administration of justice\" in reviewing a nolo plea.\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 (a)(3).

Hoffman et al.\nConclusion\n\nIn this chapter we have showed that a single approach—game theory, with the help\nof evolution and learning—can explain many of our moral intuitions and ideologies.\nWe now discuss two implications.\n\nGroup Selection. Our chapter relates to the debate on group selection, whereby\ngroup level competition and reproduction is supposed to occasionally cause indi-\nviduals to evolve to sacrifice their own payoffs to benefit the group (e.g., Wilson,\n2006). One of the primary pieces of evidence cited in support of group selection is\nthe existence of human cooperation and morality (Fehr & Fischbacher, 2003; Fehr,\nFischbacher, & Gichter, 2002; Gintis, Bowles, Boyd, & Fehr, 2003; Haidt, 2012;\nWilson, 2010, 2012), in particular: giving in one-shot anonymous laboratory experi-\nments, intuitively sacrificing one’s life for the group Gumping on the grenade), and\ncontributions to public goods or charity. However, we have reviewed an alternative\nexplanation for these phenomena that does not rest on group selection. It also yields\npredictions about these phenomena that group selection does not, such as that peo-\nple are more likely to cooperate when they are being observed and there is variance\nin the cost of cooperation. The approach described here also explains other phenom-\nena, such as categorical norms and ineffective altruism. These lead to social welfare\nlosses, which is suboptimal from the group’s perspective. The categorical norm\nagainst murder, for example, leads to enormous waste when keeping alive, some-\ntimes for years, those who have virtually no chance of a future productive life.\n\nAdmittedly, despite their inefficiencies, these moral intuitions do not rule out\ngroup selection, since group selection can be weak relative to individual selection.\nBut it does provide a powerful argument that group selection is unnecessary for\nexplaining many interesting aspects of human morality. It also suggests that group\nselection is, indeed, at most, weak. One example that makes this especially clear is\ndiscrete norms. Recall that we argued that continuous norms are not sustainable\nbecause individuals benefit by deviating around the threshold. Notice that this ben-\nefit is small, since the likelihood that signals are right around the threshold is low.\nGroup selection could easily overwhelm the benefit one would get from deviating\nfrom this Nash equilibrium, suggesting group selection is weak (i.e. there are few\ngroup-level reproductive events, high migration rates, high rates of “mutation” in\nthe form of experimentation among individuals, etc.).\n\nLogical Justification of Moral Intuitions. In each of the applications above, we\nexplained moral intuitions without referring to existing a priori logical justifications\nby philosophers or others. Our explanation for our sense of rights does not rely on\nLocke’s “state of nature.” No argument we gave rests on God as an orderly designer,\non Platonic ideals, on Kant’s concepts of autonomy and humanity, etc. What does\nthis mean for these a priori justifications? It suggests that they are not the source of\nour morality and are, instead, post hoc justifications of our intuitions (Haidt, 2012).\n\nTo see what we mean, consider the following analogy. One might wonder why\nwe find paintings and sculptures of voluptuous women beautiful.

I told Danny Yatom to inform the Americans we were\nleaving and to get our plane ready to take us back to Israel. I let the others in our\nteam know that we were going. A number of them, and several of the Americans as\nwell, urged me to reconsider. But I said I saw no point in staying. What I didn’t\nknow, however, was that one of the Palestinians’ original Oslo negotiators, Hassan\nAsfour, had approached Dennis Ross with a new proposal: that we ask Arafat to\naccept everything except the proposal on the holy sites as a basis for negotiation.\nSovereignty over the Temple Mount would be addressed in later, international\nnegotiations. When Dennis brought this to me, my instinct was to say no. Like so\nmuch else at the summit, it was an inherently skewed formula: it would involve\nmajor Israeli concessions on all the other main issues, without securing our\nabsolute minimum need in Jerusalem: sovereignty over the Temple Mount. I didn’t\nsay yes. Still, with Clinton’s words of advice still on my mind, I said that I’d think\nit over.\n\nWhen I met the rest of the Israeli team, almost all of them felt we should stay.\nThe consensus was that especially if violence broke out after the summit’s\ncollapse, we didn’t want to feel we’d left any stone unturned. At about 11 pm, I\nphoned the President and told him that we would stay until he returned from\nOkinawa. He was clearly pleased, and asked us to keep working in his absence.\nWhen I resisted that, saying that any substantive talks needed his involvement, we\nfinally agreed that talks could continue in search of a formula for the holy sites. On\nall the other issues, only informal discussions would be held until and unless a way\nahead on the Temple Mount was found. If that happened, and if Arafat finally\naccepted the “pocket” proposals as an agreed starting point, formal negotiations\ncould resume. Clinton accepted this formula. He went to see Arafat and secured —\nor thought he had secured — his agreement as well.\n\nOne of the President’s great strengths was his genius for blurring the edges of\npotential differences in search of common ground. But when edges had to be\nsharpened, this could lead to confusion. Before leaving for the G8, the President\nneglected to mention to Arafat our explicit understanding that, with the exception\nof the talks on the holy sites, nothing would happen until he accepted the\nconcessions that President Clinton and I had delivered as at least a basis for further\nnegotiations. As a result, Arafat’s team now set about happily asking questions and\nprobing my negotiators — pushing us to go further — but with no more inclination\nthan before to produce any concessions of their own.\n\n369\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028217\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

You chose yourself.” The problem for\nSnowden was anonymously drawing her into his enterprise.\n\nPoitras was living in Berlin in January 2013, which made her vul-\nnerable to NSA surveillance. To get to her through an encrypted\nchannel, Snowden chose a circuitous approach. On January 11, he\nwrote to Micah Lee in Berkeley, California. Given Lee’s residence\nin the United States, as Snowden knew, the NSA would be legally\nbarred from monitoring his communications without a warrant.\nHe used Lee, who was the chief technology officer at the Freedom\nof the Press Foundation, as the encrypted gateway to Poitras. Lee\nwas also well-connected to others whom Snowden had contacted\n\n© for his CryptoParty. Lee had been an associate of Runa Sandvik’s at ®\nTor and was a prominent member of Noisebridge, an eclectic anti-\ngovernment hackers’ commune based in Northern California, of\nwhich Appelbaum was also a member.\n\nTo contact Lee, Snowden chose the alias Anon1o8.

Lee wrote to Poitras about Anon1o8.

The Hubble particle chooses after the Mars particle. This is\npredetermination and it breaks the Kochen-Specker theorem.\n\nYou can reverse the whole analysis and see the same problem from\nthe other point of view. There is a paradox here however you look at it.\n\nThe only solution to the paradox is that both particles make their\nchoice without any information from an outside source; particles have\nfree will. This means at least one new piece of information spontaneously\nappears in the Universe — a ‘bit’ of free will, so to speak.\n\nYou might think there is a problem because the first particle affects\nits twin, even if the second did not receive any outside influence. This\nwould result in the Kochen-Specker paradox reemerging. There is a\nneat way out of this; time has no meaning for the particles. Or, I should\nsay, relative time has no meaning and, therefore, has no effect. There is\nno concept of before or after between the particles. They live in a little\nbubble of space-time where the order of events has no meaning. The\nparticles make their free choice together within this safe bubble, and the\nparadox is avoided.

There is no clock valid for both particles, so\nthere is no possible answer to the question.\n\nConway and Kochen have proven sub-atomic particles have free will\n— or at least entangled bosons do. At this point, their argument becomes\na philosophical one. They propose that these particles pass on this free\nwill to larger entities in the Universe and ultimately to us. Although\nparticles are small and insignificant, they are the fundamental building\nblocks of nature, and the butterfly effect multiplies up tiny variations in\nthe microscopic world into the macroscopic events we see.\n\nAlthough their theorem is very elegant, we still have to address the\nquestion of whether the experimenter has the true freedom to run the\nexperiment in the first place: the determined determinist argument.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016039\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

(To show how\nlittle has changed in more than half a century of poor education, my daughter in her sophomore\nyear at Yale had to memorize and spout back on the final exam, the name of British landscape\nportraits, the year they were painted and the museum in which they hang. It's as if God hadn't\ninvented Google precisely to eliminate such absurd memorization tasks.)\n\nA few years earlier, I impressed my children at Steve’s ice cream shop in Cambridge, which\noffered free ice cream to anyone who could answer really obscure trivial pursuit questions. The\nquestion of the month that no one had answered was: “What was the Lone Ranger’s family name?\n(Most people said “Ranger.”) I immediately blurted out “Reed.” I added that Reed was also the\nGreen Hornet’s family name because according to the “origin story” in a comic book that I had\nread half a century earlier, they were cousins.\n\nDuring my junior year in high school, my memory for obscure facts and the “parlor tricks” I\nplayed with it got me an interview with the producers of a television game show called “The\n$64,000 question,” but I failed the personality part of the test and was rejected. That was\nfortunate, since the show was rigged. (I still have the letter from “Production Services Company”\nat 667 Madison Avenue informing me that the results of my written examination “are gratifying”\nand inviting me for the personal interview I failed). But my “mother’s memory” has served me\nwell as a lawyer, teacher—and joke teller. (The downside of remembering every joke I ever\nheard is that I rarely get to hear a “new” joke, because I’ve heard—and told—a good many jokes\nover my lifetime).\n\nI not only remember the jokes I’ve heard (and told and retold) over the years, but more\nimportantly, I remember nearly every case I ever read, nearly every fact in the records of cases\nand nearly every principle of law I ever learned. I try to teach my students to develop and rely on\ntheir memories rather than on their stereotypical skills. During the first two weeks of law school,\nI forbid my first year students to take any notes (“meturnished”). I assure them that nothing\ndiscussed during this “listening” period will be on the exam and I urge them to learn how to listen\nand remember, because this will be very important in court and other professional settings. Many\nof the students react nervously because they have never been denied the ability to take notes, but\nafter a few days they acclimate, and some even appreciate, the different regime.\n\nMy good memory went mostly to waste in my early years, because there was so little worth\nremembering. We would be given a quarter to memorize passages from holy texts and a dollar if\nwe could recite “by heart” (what does that mean?) an entire chapter from the Bible. Only once\ndid my memory serve me well during my adolescence, and that was at my Bar Mitzvah. Prior to\n“becoming a man,” I had never really excelled at anything. I was good, but not great, at athletics;\ngood, but not great, with my social life, and God-awful in academics and behavior. But my Bar\nMitzvah performance was perfect. I had read the Torah portion—“Judges and\nMagistrates”—flawlessly, because I was able to memorize the entire reading, melody and all. My\nperformance was the talk of the neighborhood. But a month later, my friend Jerry (now a\nprominent rabbi) read his Torah portion in the same synagogue. He was awful, making mistake\nafter mistake, and singing off tune. It was embarrassing. The rabbi then got up to give the\nsermon.

I told our team we\ncould not play that game. Until there was at least some movement from Arafat, I\ndidn’t want them suggesting any Israeli concessions. We’d obviously get nothing\nin return. The summit would fail. Despite my repeated insistence both to the\nAmericans and Palestinians that, without an agreement, any Israeli suggestions\nwould be null and void, that didn’t mean they would simply be forgotten. The\nresult is that we’d actually be in a worse situation than before Camp David.\nPolitically, I’d find myself in much the same position as President Assad, after the\nleak of the American draft from Shepherdstown: apparently ready to consider\ngiving Arafat the great majority of the West Bank, without the slightest sign Arafat\nwas ready for a full and final peace. But that wasn’t my main concern. It was that\nanything that we put on the table here would handcuff future Israeli governments if\nand when an “end of conflict” agreement became possible.\n\nStill, when Dennis Ross learned from my negotiators what I’d decided, he was\nfrustrated and upset. He came to see me on Saturday morning — day-five of what\nwas looking increasingly like a stillborn summit. “This summit was your idea,” he\nsaid, reminding me that the President had agreed to it over the reservations of a lot\nhis own aides. He told me that at a minimum, I| had to help give it a chance: by\ngiving him my true negotiating “red lines.” Either that, or give my negotiators\nmore leeway to explore compromises. I did not want to make Dennis’s job any\nmore difficult than it already was. And I told him I was still ready to engage fully\nif we ever got to the real substance of a possible deal. “But I can’t do what you’ve\nasked me,” I replied. “Not when Arafat is simply holding firm and not showing a\nwillingness even to ook for compromises.”\n\nFortunately for my relationship with the President — though not for the\nprospects of an agreement — Clinton had considerably more sympathy with my\nposition after his next meeting with both sets of negotiators that afternoon. It was a\nreturn encounter with Abu Ala’a on territory and borders. Shlomo Ben-Ami now\nproduced a map of the West Bank with our proposed breakdown into the areas that\nwould be controlled by a Palestinian state, the part Israel would retain to\naccommodate the major settlements, and territory which we suggested would go to\n\n355\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028203\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Cross-market correlations to remain much\nlower than in recent years.\n\ne Economics — US activity data are coming in better than hoped, but we\nneed another 1-2 months to see how consumers are responding to higher\ntaxes.\n\ne Fixed Income — Search for carry to trump Euro area jitters over time\ne Equities — Japan remains our main country overweight.\n\ne Credit — We OW covered bonds in the Euro periphery over senior bank\nbonds and subordinated vs senior bank bonds in the core\n\ne Currencies — Cyprus to have minimal further impact on EUR, but a ECB\nrate cut would push it a few cents lower versus the dollar.\n\ne Commodities — Stay long Brent and short gasoline.\n\ne US stocks continue to gain, with the benchmark S&P500 breaching its\nall time high level today in a gentle fashion. Bonds are generally up this\nweek on dovish comments from both the Fed and the BoJ. Commodities\nhave gained also, but credit remains the troubled asset class with spreads\nwider in most markets, especially in EM external debt.\n\ne Our overall investment theme remains that there is no overarching\nglobal investment theme anymore this year but instead a number of\nunrelated local forces that have largely local impact. The generalized\nasset reflation we saw last year, with risk premia coming down consistently\nacross the globe and asset classes, was due to a gradual fading of tail risks\nthat has since been largely completed. “Risk-on, risk- off is so last year”.\n\ne In addition, we are seeing no momentum either way in global growth,\nprice or earnings expectations that could put us into a bullish or bearish\ngrowth story. Our 2.4% projection for 2013 world economic growth is\nunchanged since November. YTD activity data for the world are tracking\nour 2.6% forecast for Q1, comfortably up from the dismal 1.6% in Q4 of last\nyear. Amidst offsetting up- and downside surprises in the US and Japan\nversus Europe, there has been no reason yet to raise the growth profile for\nthe year as a whole. We hope, but need evidence first.\n\ne Without a global growth or fading-of-tail-risks force, we are left with a set\nof local issues and opportunities that are having a local impact, at the\nregional, asset class and company level, that should leave the rest of the\nworld largely unmoved. In this environment, correlations across regions\nand risk markets should remain significantly lower than in past years.\nVarious markets may seem to behave “inconsistently” with others, but we\ncaution against expecting simple mean reversion, given our view of the\nreduced impact of global factors.

In the report, the State Treasurer's\nOffice stated that the cannabis industry’s lack of access to banking services is one of the biggest threats\nto the success of the state’s recreational cannabis law, which is scheduled for implementation starting\nin January 2018. Based on the working group’s findings, the State Treasurer’s Office recommended the\nfollowing four actions:\n\n1. Implementation of safer, more effective, and scalable ways to handle the payment of taxes and\nfees in cash that minimize risks to stakeholders.\n\n2. Development by the State of California and local governments of a data portal of compliance\nand regulatory data to be made available to financial institutions that bank cannabis businesses.\n\n3. Conduct a feasibility study of a public bank or other state-backed financial institution that\nprovides banking services to the cannabis industry.\n\n4. Establish a multistate consortium of state government representatives and other stakeholders\nto pursue changes to federal law in order to remove the barriers to cannabis banking.\n\nThe State Treasurer’s Office also stated it was apparent that a definitive solution to the cannabis\nbanking quandary will remain elusive until the federal government removes cannabis from its official\nlist of dangerous drugs or the U.S. Congress approves safe harbor legislation protecting financial insti-\ntutions that serve cannabis businesses from federal penalties.\n\nFederal Securities Law\n\nThe U.S. securities markets and industry participants are regulated principally under two federal laws:\nthe Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).\nThe Securities Act regulates the offer and sale of securities by issuers, and the Exchange Act regulates\nsecurities firms, stock exchanges, reporting by publicly traded companies and investing and trading\npractices of investors. The Exchange Act also establishes the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC), a federal agency charged with enforcing federal securities laws.\n\nFederal securities laws are intended to facilitate capital formation, maintain fair and efficient mar-\nkets, and protect investors. The laws are based on a philosophy of disclosure: issuers of securities\ngenerally are obligated to completely and truthfully disclose material information to investors and\nthe market, and failure to satisfy that obligation may result in civil or criminal penalties. Information\ngenerally required to be disclosed includes audited financial statements, discussions of risks applicable\nto the issuer and investors in its securities, and details of conflicts of interest faced by the issuer’s officers\nand directors.\n\nFederal securities laws related to private offerings provide fewer investor protections than laws\nrelated to public offerings and generally assume investors in private offerings can “fend for themselves.”\nAn issuer of securities in a private offering is not subject to the same extensive reporting requirements\n\n80 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024716\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

OPPORTUNITY IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR\n\nThe Fund Managers believe a number of macro market factors have aligned to create attractive\nand lasting conditions for NLV-III’s targeted investment strategy in healthcare technology.\nEach of these market factors individually would have a direct positive impact on the level of\nrisk and the potential for returns from investments in the healthcare technology sector. The fact\nthat there are positive trends in all of them occurring simultaneously is unprecedented, and the\nFund Managers expect that this will create a uniquely positive environment for NLV-III’s\ninvestments in the healthcare technology sector. These macro market factors include the\nfollowing:\n\nSTRONG GROWTH IN GLOBAL HEALTHCARE MARKETS\n\nHealthcare is one of the largest and most dynamic segments of the global economy, and its\ngrowth is projected to continue the well-established historical trend of outpacing GDP growth\nin major economies for at least the next decade.2! In the U.S., since 1970, health care spending\nper capita has grown at an average annual rate of 8.2% or 2.4 percentage points faster than\nnominal GDP. The persistence of this trend suggests systematic differences between health care\nand other economic sectors where growth rates are typically more in line with the overall\neconomy. A smaller difference is projected over the 2011 to 2020 period, where the average\nannual growth in per capita health spending (5.3%) is projected to be about 140 basis points\nhigher than the growth in GDP (3.9%). This powerful and sustained growth differentiates\nhealthcare from many other large industrial and technology sectors, and it creates a positive\nbackdrop for investment in certain areas within the sector.\n\nThe drivers of healthcare market growth vary between mature and emerging economies, but in\nboth cases the shifts are resulting in significant increases in per capita health care consumption\nand predictable increases in spending to meet the rising demand. In developed economies,\ngrowth is being driven primarily by an aging population coupled with a continued willingness\nof payers to cover the costs for new therapeutics and interventions that meaningfully extend or\nimprove the quality of patients’ lives. In the U.S., which is representative of the demographic\nshifts in other major economies, the number of people over 65 is expected to double over the\nnext three decades, reaching 70 million by 2030 or roughly 20% of the total U.S. population.\nThis aging demographic has a higher prevalence of disease and the cost of delivering care to\ntreat the diseases of this older demographic is rising steadily. For example, in 2009, the per\ncapita health care cost for a person 65 - 74 years old was approximately $14,000, but it was more\nthan double that ($33,000) for those over 85. Before the end of this decade, the projected per\ncapita annual cost to care for these same two groups is expected to rise to $22,000 (+57%) for 65\n- 74 year olds and $55,000 (+67%) for those 85+24.\n\nEmerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRICs) are also contributing to the\ngrowth in health care spending globally, as these emerging markets mature and begin moving\ntowards the standards of their counterparts in developed economies.

Rev. 861, *877\n\nwitnesses, but also the victim as well. ?° Notably, the Advisory Committee's rationale for this change was to \"implement[] the\nvictim's \"right to be treated with fairness’ under the Crime Victims' Rights Act.\" °?’ But if a change to the relatively obscure\nRule 18 is appropriate in light of the victim's right to fairness, why aren't changes to many other, more significant rules also\nappropriate?\n\nFurther highlighting the inconsistent treatment of the right to fairness is the way the Advisory Committee handled parallel\nprovisions in the CVRA. In a single clause, the CVRA gives victims the right to be treated not only with fairness, but also with\ndignity and respect: section (a)(8) of the CVRA provides that victims shall enjoy \"the right to be treated with fairness and with\nrespect for the victim's dignity and privacy.\" °* The Advisory Committee used victims' rights to dignity and respect as a\n\"springboard\" in several places. For example, the Advisory Committee proposed an amendment to prevent inappropriate\nsubpoenas for personal or confidential formation about a victim, explaining that \"this amendment implements the Crime\nVictims Rights Act, codified at /S U.S.C. § 377](a)(8), which states that victims have a right to respect for their \"dignity and\nprivacy.\" °° Similarly, the Advisory Committee proposed an amendment to prevent the inappropriate release of a victim's\naddress and telephone number as part of alibi defense disclosures, explaining that \"this amendment implements the victims’\nrights under the Crime Victims Rights Act ... to be treated with respect for the [*878] victim's dignity and privacy.\" !°° Why\nthe Advisory Committee believed it appropriate to try to implement the \"dignity and privacy\" provisions of the CVRA but not\nthe immediately adjacent \"fairness\" provision is unclear.\n\nC. The Advisory Committee Should Not Leave the CVRA's Interpretation to the Litigation Process.\n\nThe Advisory Committee also justified its decision not to review the Rules for fairness on the ground that it would \"not\nattempt to use the rules to anticipate and resolve the interpretative questions that will arise\" under the CVRA. !°! Yet a basic\npurpose - perhaps the basic purpose - behind the procedural rules is to lay out answers to questions that might otherwise have to\nbe litigated. To that end, Rule 2 of the criminal rules provides that \"these rules are to be interpreted to provide for the just\ndetermination of every criminal proceeding, to secure simplicity in procedure and fairness in administration, and to eliminate\nunjustifiable expense and delay.\" !° It is at odds with securing simplicity in procedure to simply regurgitate the language of\nthe CVRA in the criminal rules, leaving every interpretative question to the vagaries of litigation.\n\nHistorical examples are legion of the Advisory Committee amending the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure precisely to\nresolve questions that were being (or might have been) litigated. To provide a few straightforward examples, in 1979 the\nAdvisory Committee amended and clarified the standards for presentence withdrawal of a guilty plea. The Advisory Committee\nnoted that courts had \"critically stated that the Rule offers little guidance as to the applicable standard for a presentence\nwithdrawal of plea and that as a result the contours of [the presentence] standard [in the rule] are not easily defined.\" 1°?

But in the course of conversations I've had researching a new book on President Trump and the forces arrayed against him, it has become clear that Robert Mueller and his office are already preparing for a life or death confrontation with the President and the mother of all constitutional crises.\n\tOver the last several months the Mueller office has prepared a possible indictment of the president on charges related to obstruction of justice and devised a legal strategy to navigate the inevitable fallout from such an indictment.\n\tMy discussions have been with both White House advisors and people close to the investigation—that is, sources on both sides of the possible conflict. No source involved in this story would speak on the record. But in broad-strokes each side's understanding matches the account provided to me by the other side.\n\tSince at least April the Special Counsel has had in place a set of allegations, proposed charges, and an aggressive legal theory to support the indictment of the president on obstruction charges. In the last few weeks, as the President has indulged his pardon authority, the Mueller team has also developed a legal basis to oppose what the Special Counsel believes will be a likely pardon of former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn—who had previously struck a plea bargain which could include his testimony against the President—and what it believes to be another step in the President's obstruction efforts.\n\tAt this point, the case for indictment has, in effect, a judge of one, since the Mueller team must get the approval of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to proceed. As recently as April, Rosenstein publicly declared that the President was not a target, but this may have been a kind of fig leaf: technically the President does not become a formal target until Rosenstein agrees to designate him as one. It may also illustrate a conflict between the Deputy Attorney General and the investigators he has overseen since the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions from the Russia-related investigation—though, according to one source, Mueller believes he does have the support of his boss.\n\tThe proposed indictment would be all the more controversial because it finds the entire narrative of the case for obstruction in plain sight. Almost nothing in it involves new information; rather, it takes well-covered public events and moves them to a set of circumstantial conclusions. There is no smoking gun beyond the often flagrant, custom-breaking, events of the President's 16 months in office. Indeed, much of the evidence is based on the President's public statements and tweets about those events. \"This indictment could have been drafted without anyone being interviewed,\" said one source. This is, from the perspective of White House sources good news: the case then, is just an issue of what motives are ascribed to the President's behavior—behavior that is, the President's supporters believe it is easy to show, impulsive and not thought out. Hence no intent. For the Mueller team, it is precisely that careless behavior and flagrant disregard for constitutional standards that they hope to put on trial.\n\tAccording to a source involved in the Mueller strategy, the plan to indict the President is now \"more advanced\" than it was when the terms of the indictment were agreed in April. In the intervening months, the president’s lawyers, spokespersons and surrogates have staged a very public debate about whether such a legal proceeding would be constitutional—in effect trying to discredit, ahead of time, any prosecutorial action the Special Counsel’s office might take. This may be a preemptive response to an indictment they expect is forthcoming. It may also be an effort to pressure Rosenstein. It may even be an effort to convince Mueller of that, since some in the White House believe that that the plan to indict is not a strategy yet embraced by the whole Special Counsel’s office, but one that is being advocated only by its most virulently anti-Trump purists on the investigative team—most notably by the number two lawyer under Mueller, Andrew Weissmann.\n\tIt may be noteworthy that there appears now not to be plan for an indictment related to collusion, although, legal experts say, that could come later and may depend on new information from the investigation of the President's personal attorney, Michael Cohen. It is also possible that alternative plans have been made—preparation for more expansive indictments, for instance, or for a broader report that would include the allegations of obstruction but not seek to indict the President. \n\tThe White House view is that without the underlying collusion charge—\"real collusion,\" in the words of one White House advisor, \"and not just a bunch of Facebook ads and some trolls\"—Mueller will be presenting a weak and politically-motivated case. \"That's a witch hunt,\" said the advisor. The view of the Mueller team, or at least that of its most ardent members, seems to be that the obstruction charges go to the very heart of exposing how Trump has abused his power and turned the White House into a corrupt fiefdom.\n\tAccording to one source, Mueller could hardly contain his disgust when last month Rudy Giuliani, the President's new lawyer—hired to make a case for the President on television and to push back against the Mueller team—airily dismissed the notion that a sitting president can be indicted. Adding insult to injury, Giuliani—who a White House source said has likely learned of aspects of the pending indictment—said Mueller agreed with that assessment. White House sources believe Giuliani was daring the Special Counsel to tip his hand. But Mueller, ever in character, contained his outrage and continued to hold his cards close, as his team finished preparing the obstruction case and refined the legal theories under which it would claim the right to haul the president into court.\n\tAccording to the proposed indictment, the President's scheme to obstruct the FBI's investigation into connections between the Trump campaign and Russian efforts to undermine the U.S. election began on the 7th day of the Trump administration. Three days prior, on January 24, National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, lied to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. These were contacts, according to the indictment, directed by an unnamed but ranking member of the Presidential Transition team. In the view of several former DOJ lawyers who discussed the case with me, that unnamed person could be Trump himself. From January 27th, when the President had the one-on-one dinner with FBI Director James Comey, through to the middle of April, the President conducted a cat and mouse game with Comey, testing his loyalty and trying to establish his willingness to aide the President and protect Flynn.  On May 9th, baldly admitting his dissatisfaction with Comey's unwillingness to play ball on Russia, the President fired the FBI director. Shortly thereafter, continuing his efforts to disrupt the investigation, the President turned his ire on the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, pressuring him to fall into line on the President's behalf, and on Robert Mueller, the newly appointed Special Counsel, pushing to fire him to block the investigation. \n\tThe second episode addressed in the indictment took place on July 8, on Air Force one, where the President personally directed his son, Don, Jr., to lie about the reason for his meeting in Trump Tower, during the campaign, with representatives of the Russian government—a meeting about collaborating with the Russians to undermine Hillary Clinton's campaign. \n\tThe third episode detailed in the indictment began on June 7th, after reports that Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe would confirm statements made by James Comey about how the president had tried to intimidate him. In response, the President began a campaign of harassment, threats, and intimidation against McCabe. On March 16, 2018, after McCabe testified before Congress, the President, in retaliation, caused his dismissal and the loss of his pension.\n\n\n\tThe Mueller team may have a high hurdle in convincing Rosenstein to approve the indictment. In its preparation for a possible indictment, the Mueller team argues that nothing in the Constitution or in a statute suggests a status with regard to criminal prosecution for the President different from any other federal office. Nor is there any statute or case law that finds that impeachment has to come before an indictment. But the Department of Justice's standing view precludes charging a sitting president with a crime. This is based on an opinion written by the Office of Legal Counsel in the Watergate era and recently expressed in hyperbolic terms by Giuliani: the President could kill James Comey if he wanted to without fear of prosecution. But, according to several former DOJ lawyers, Rosenstein in this circumstance may have the power to override the Office of Legal Counsel opinion. The Mueller team appears to believe that Rosenstein's pledge before congress that, absent malfeasance, he will support the Special Counsel's independence with regard to the Russian investigation, means he will let the indictment go forward. In one view—and in the suspicion of some in the White House—he may have already authorized Mueller to proceed with the indictment.\n\tThe White House has made the argument—supported in many television appearances by Trump legal surrogate, Alan Dershowitz— that a president cannot be prosecuted for exercising his constitutional prerogatives, even if those actions foster a crime, that the President, as the ultimate federal office, and the nation's chief law enforcement officer, enjoys nearly unfettered latitude in how he carries out his duties. \"I don't think you are going to find a court who will not see the president's role as unique,\" said one White House advisor. \"The Mueller theories are wishful thinking.\"\n\tAn indictment for obstruction of Justice is described in similar ways by both Mueller and White House insiders: it puts the President's public behavior on trial. The nature of that behavior, for the Mueller team, is corrupt; this, according to the White House, is how voters elected the President to behave.\n\tThe Special Counsel seems less worried about its legal position than it does about it's existential one—continuing to anticipate how the President might use his authority to move against it. \n\tIt sees its most immediate threat as a move by the President to replace Rosenstein. Here it believes that in the inevitable Supreme Court battle that would follow a direct attempt by the President to fire the Special Counsel, the Court would likely rebuff such an expansion of Presidential authority. At the same time, according to its internal research, the Mueller team understands that the President, acting with only somewhat more subtlety, would have the authority to order the Attorney General—even given his prior recusal—to repeal the Special Counsel regulations and close down the investigation. He can fire the Attorney General if he refuses. The President, could, too, according to the Special Counsel's analysis, fire Rosenstein and seek someone else to oversee the investigation in ways more to his liking. Both of these actions could, the Special Counsel believes, become part of the behavior that it argues in the indictment amounts to a prima facie case for obstruction of justice. \n\tThe Mueller team continues to believe it is protected by political realities—the President can not know how Congress might respond, and it might well respond with impeachment—and by bureaucratic ones. Changes to the Special Counsel authorization might require an extended comment period, meanwhile leaving the Special Counsel's status unchanged.\n\tStill, what if the President, acting unilaterally, does shut it down? This, people around the President say is the unknown legal area that might be advantageous to the President. The delays and disruption that result as courts sort out the ramifications of the President's actions might well be the President's legal friend—the reason some in the White House have been urging the President to end the investigation, whatever the political fallout. \n\tIf so, what then happens to all the work the Special Counsel's office has done, and, indeed, to the sitting Grand Juries reviewing the evidence? The special counsel's view, according to insiders working on the issues, is that nobody knows. The optimistic legal view is that the Office and staff would survive the Special Counsel's ouster and their work preserved. And that actions taken by the Grand Jury would remain in effect.\n\tThis, however, would probably not be true if the Attorney General refused the next Special Counsel's budget request—due on July 1. That would shut down the whole operation—the Special Counsel staff and grand juries. There might, however, according to research the team has prepared, be enough time between the order and the shuttering for the Special Counsel to share the grand jury evidence with other federal prosecutors, who might act on their own authority to pursue the President.\n\tThe President's constitutional pardon powers appear to be some of the most troubling and threatening issues for the Special Counsel. The Counsel's office believes the President will use his pardon power as an instrument to undermine the investigation.\n\tAccording to present and former White House advisors, the President's recent spate of pardons are in part his way of taunting the Special Counsel. The White House, according to these sources, is aware that the Special Counsel has concluded the President's pardon power is near absolute: the President can certainly pardon himself, and others involved in the investigation. \n\tEarly in June, the Special Counsel, believing that a pardon for Michael Flynn was imminent, rushed to build a case that might form an exception to the President's pardon authority. The argument, perhaps a slim-thread one, tries to undermine what both the White House and many outside legal authorities, and much of the Special Counsel's own research, believes to be one of the few unchallengeable powers granted the President. In effect, the Special Counsel continues the theme of it's case: there is a level of obstruction of justice that all reasonable men might know when they see it. If you pardon someone to get yourself off the hook, that's a \"corrupt\" action. The constitution is not a statute that you might violate, but a larger covenant which you might offend (or, equally, that might protect you). Since the President is in charge of upholding the constitution and much of the constitution is about preventing corrupt acts or abuses of power, the pardon, in the case of Michael Flynn, is, the Mueller team is set to argue, unconstitutional. What's more, since there is an impeachment process in place—or there are impeachment resolutions before congress—and impeachment is the province of Congress, a pardon of a potential witness in this impeachment is an unconstitutional trampling on the separation of powers.\n\nAs the President, by nature and design, tries to claim aggressive new powers, the Mueller team, almost in equal proportion, is trying to limit the theory of Presidential power and, even, to criminalize an expansive exercise of those powers. \n\tPeople who know and have worked with Mueller find it, at best, unexpected that this traditional by the book G-man would be pursuing such far-reaching legal theories. But one possible explanation, shared by many in the White House, is that Mueller is overly reliant on his staff—in face, is being led by his number two, Andrew Weissmann.\n     Weismann has a longstanding reputation for aggression: he was the prosecutor whose pursuit of the accounting firm Arthur Anderson in the Enron debacle ended in its conviction—a judgment reversed well after the firm's bankruptcy and dissolution. One White House advisor likened him to Victor Hugo's obsessed policeman Inspector Javert—a prosecutor consumed with taking down the President. Indeed, Weissmann, who has in the past contributed to Democratic candidates, is a particular bet noir and favorite whipping boy for the White House his central role in the Mueller investigation taken there as evidence of a deep bias against Donald Trump. \n\tBut in another view it is precisely because Mueller, a former Marine, is so by the book and Semper Fi that he finds Trump's behavior to be personally offensive, and, on its face, corrupt. \"Bob Mueller is all about limits and rules. Donald Trump has none and acknowledges none,\" said one lawyer who has worked with Mueller in the past.\n\tIt may yet be even a more profound clash then that, the executive branch at war with itself—the Justice Department against the White House. In this, the President's almost daily tirades against the DOJ, the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, the Deputy Attorney General, Rosenstein, the former head of the FBI, Comey, and his deputy, Andrew McCabe, are part of an effort to obstruct justice and save himself.\n\tThe Mueller strategy (or Weissmann strategy) is a war strategy, in the view of some legal observers. An indictment of the President would be litigated to the hilt. It would force both the substantive issues of obstruction and abuse of power and the meta issues of Presidential immunity—in essence, the President's claims to being above the law—into open court for a long and painful review and dissection that might shadow the November election. \n\tLegal experts believe that the Mueller team might well prevail in lower courts with a much less certain outcome in the Supreme Court. \n\tWere the case to reach the Supreme Court after the November election, it might well be the results of that election that help seal the President's fate not just in Congress but also in the courts.\n\t\"Might such an expansive claim win, yes. Should it win, no.\" But everyone knows the reality: weak presidents lose cases, strong presidents win them,\" said Ken Starr, the former independent prosecutor who might know more about the legal pursuit of the president than anyone else on earth.\n\n\n\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I also took\nalong a strong security team, including Shlomo Yanai, head of strategic planning\nthe kirya, and Israel Hason, a former deputy-head of Shin Bet. There was another\nimportant, if less obvious, inclusion: Dan Meridor. A leading member of the Likud\nbefore he’d formed the Center Party at the last election, Dan was not just a friend.\nHe was a man of rock-solid integrity, with a strong moral and ethical compass,\nwho put principle over party. He was also a lawyer, and had been Minister of\nJustice under Bibi. Along with Attorney-General Rubinstein, I knew I’d have a\ngifted legal team if we got to the point of considering the specifics of a peace\nagreement. There was another consideration as well. Both Dan and Elyakim were\nright-of-center politically. I felt I needed their voices as a kind of litmus for the\ntough decisions, and concessions, I might have to consider if an agreement did\nprove possible.\n\nI was not nervous as we crossed the Atlantic, though even those who knew me\nbest assumed I would be. Nava had sent me off with a list of dietary instructions,\nalmost like a surgeon general’s warning that Camp David might prove hazardous\nto my health. But I felt prepared. I’d gone to every source I could find about the\nBegin-Sadat summit. I knew there would be periods of crisis and that at certain\npoints I’d have to allow leeway for my own team to explore possible compromises\nbeyond our set negotiating limits. Yet none of this altered my belief that holding\nthe summit was the right thing to do, nor my confidence in being able to play my\npart. I did feel a huge responsibility.

Morgan Eye on the Market 2/27/2012: Dire Straits\nSent: 2/27/2012 5:50:08 PM\nAttachments: 02-27-2012 - EOTM - Dire Straits.pdf\n\nEye on the Market, February 27, 2012 [the attached PDF is much easier to read this week, particularly if you are interested in the energy science implications of last week’s press release from the House Minority Leader]\n\nTopics: oil markets and Iran\n\n \n\nMost of this week’s note deals with oil prices and Iran, but I did want to point out a trend that is illustrative of how things are going globally.  One of the strongest aspects of the US recovery has been the rebound in business spending on equipment and software.  As highlighted by our friends at Hamiltonian Associates, sales by Caterpillar’s dealer network are a proxy for global trends.  Caterpillar’s US sales are leading the pack for the first time in a while, Asia is moderating, and Europe trails with a distinctly negative trend.  We expect a recovery in US payrolls this year, and eventually, in labor incomes.  The US recovery may be weak by historical standards, but expectations are pretty low (2.2% growth in 2012).  We expect the US to exceed expectations, and for Europe ex-Germany to disappoint them.  Absent a blow-up in Iran, this view seems like it’s on track.  \n\n \n\n“Iranium enrichment”: another hurdle for global markets to surmount\n\nThe near-term fundamentals don’t point to higher oil prices.  Oil demand has been revised down a bit, particularly in the OECD, and non-OPEC supply growth is a little higher in 2012 than in recent years.  After netting all the supply and demand factors, it looks like there will be a global oil inventory build in 2012 (see chart below), not something we would normally associate with rising oil prices.  However, even before we get to Iran, there are other factors contributing to higher prices: a pick-up in global growth expectations for 2013 and beyond; the explosion of Central Bank balance sheets and associated reflation goals (see last week’s EoTM); and the possibility that China’s will build strategic crude oil reserves to the IEA standard of 90 days from their current level of 14.  Note as well that the inventory build is a small one, nowhere near 2002-2007 levels.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nThat’s why Iran is a risk: a disruption would make oil markets even tighter, and drive gasoline prices up further.  Even before the February spike, gasoline prices relative to earnings and income were starting to bite (2nd chart).   The private sector can handle some gasoline price increases, but probably not much more than what we’ve seen already.  The spread between retail and wholesale gasoline prices is low ($0.35, compared to a $0.35-$1.00 range), suggesting further retail increases may be in store.\n\n \n\nPeople like me now spend a lot of time on conference calls with geopolitical experts of different stripes.  On one call, speakers raised the probability of military action from 30% to 50%.  On another call, speakers mentioned that the US has “run out of senior military advisors to send to Israel, all requesting that Israel not attack unilaterally”, and believe Israel won’t.  A paper by Matt Kroenig in Foreign Affairs magazine entitled “Time to Attack Iran; Why a Strike is the Least Bad Option” resulted in a firestorm of criticism from multiple sides.  With sanctions appearing to work (Iran’s inflation, currency collapse, fewer buyers of its oil and a potential ban on Iranian banks from the global SWIFT payments network), won’t the US want to wait and see?  Most of the US military establishment seems to take this view.  The conjecture is endless.  Here are a few points I found to be of greatest relevance as we sift through this:\n\n \n\n** The US and Europe appear to take the Israeli attack threat seriously.  Economic recoveries are just beginning to form in both regions, and there are elections coming up, so for politicians to ratchet up sanctions and drive up oil and gasoline prices, they must be very concerned that without tougher sanctions, the Israelis might act.\n\n \n\n** Iran’s Fordow facility is key to understanding the debate about the effectiveness of military action, and why some are nervous that the “window for action is closing”.  Fordow is estimated to be 80-90 meters below grade, and is suspected of being ready for uranium enrichment.  The Iranians reportedly have ~80 kg of 20% enriched uranium (UF6), and need 25 kg more to convert it into enough uranium metal (UF4) for a nuclear bomb.  The most powerful conventional weapon in the US arsenal is the Massive Ordnance Penetration device (MOP), a 30,000 pound bomb with 5,000 pounds of explosives.  It travels at twice the speed of sound, and is designed to penetrate rock and concrete before detonating.  However, it would probably take 4 of these weapons, dropped in succession by B-2 bombers in the same exact spot, to destroy Fordow [a].\n\n \n\n** Military strikes could quickly escalate to engulf the entire region.  While the Israel-Iran and US-Iran dimensions are important to understand, so too are the Sunni-Shia issues in play.  Any complicity by Sunni countries in conjunction with US action (airspace, attack plans and logistics, etc.) might be seen as acts of war by Iran. \n\n \n\n** The Strait of Hormuz carries 20% of the world’s oil (17 million bpd).  There are active and de-activated pipelines in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the UAE that could divert around 5-6 mm bpd, and strategic petroleum reserves could be released.  Even so, a military battle in the Strait could cause oil prices to rise $20-$30, according to EIA and GAO 2007 estimates.\n\n \n\nTo be fair to all the analysts, journalists and think tanks, there is no reason to expect greater foresight now than during the Cuban Missile Crisis, Iraq War or other military standoffs. This is a binary market risk that in our view justifies material consideration in portfolio allocations, and that’s about all we know.  Our 2012 Outlook section on this issue was entitled “Learning to Live with a Nuclear Iran”, and that may very well be where this ends up.\n\n \n\nAs a reminder, since 2001, rising oil prices have coincided with a gradual exhaustion of conventional oil to meet marginal demand, sharp increases in operating and commodity input costs for oil companies, deeper exploratory and developmental wells, reliance on a shrinking number of deepwater fields, rising E&P spending by US oil majors to meet rising EM demand, etc.   A simplified version of this dynamic appears below: as oil production rises to meet global demand, the sources for the marginal barrel become more expensive and more complicated.  Without getting into the whole Peak Oil thing, I do think there is evidence that the marginal cost of oil will be a speed bump on growth in the years ahead, if oil production has to rise over 90 million barrels per day to support demand and the building of strategic reserves.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nOutput from the Congressional Centrifuge\n\nIn the midst of all the above, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued the following press release: \n\n \n\n“Independent reports confirm that speculators are driving up the cost of oil, hurting consumers and potentially damaging the economic recovery. Wall Street profiteering, not oil shortages, is the cause of the price spike.  In fact, U.S. oil production is at its highest level since 2003, and millions of acres have been cleared for additional development.   We need to take strong action to protect consumers from this speculation.  Unfortunately, Republicans have chosen to protect the interests of Wall Street speculators and oil companies instead of the interests of working Americans by obstructing the agencies with the responsibility of enforcing consumer protection laws.  They have also repeatedly opposed our efforts to end billions of dollars in outdated taxpayer subsidies for oil companies enjoying record profits.\n\n \n\nWe support efforts by the Obama Administration to expand domestic energy resources, including natural gas and renewable sources like wind and solar that create jobs in America and will end our dangerous dependence on foreign energy supplies.  This can be achieved because today, the United States currently has more oil and gas rigs at work than the rest of the world combined, and imports of foreign oil have decreased.\n\n \n\nWe call on the Republican leadership to act on behalf of American consumers and join our efforts to crack down on speculators who care more about their profits than the price at the pump even if these spikes harm the American consumer and our economy.”\n\n \n\nI am of course not going to comment directly on this, for many reasons, including not wanting to spend my days at California’s solar-powered detention facility in Chuckawalla Valley.  However, for anyone interested in the specific points raised in this press release, I have included some charts on the unfortunately binding constraints of science and energy economics.  Enjoy.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5. Now let’s get to the interesting part. The press release implies that natural gas and renewable energy can reduce American dependence on foreign oil (“end” is the word used). This is an appealing proposition, particularly with Brent oil prices now 5 times higher than natural gas prices on a BTU basis. So, let’s assume that the US wanted to cease all oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and the Persian Gulf. This would reduce oil imports by ~30%. If Americans still wanted to drive around just as much, absent an increase of 2.8 million bpd in US domestic crude production, electricity would have to replace the foregone gasoline.  Ergo: how much wind power or natural gas would be needed, assuming electric cars at 200 watt hours per km? And what policies would be needed on fracking, eminent domain, and subsidies for high voltage direct current power lines to transmit electricity at acceptable loss rates?\n\n \n\nNote: the charts below only account for the foregone gasoline component of the imported crude oil. Gasoline is only around 45%-50% of total refined products. The US would also have to come up with suitable domestic or foreign replacements for the rest of the barrel: jet fuel, heating oil, fuel oil, lube oils, asphalt, etc. This is a topic that is often neglected in discussions about reducing reliance on foreign oil: we do a lot more with it than just drive cars.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nMichael Cembalest\n\nChief Investment Officer\n\n \n\n[Note a] Austin Long at Columbia University walked me through the geodynamics of the MOP and how many would be needed to penetrate the Fordow facility.  His calculations are a function of soil hardness/density, the weapon’s mass and impact velocity, the shape of its cone, and the percentage of each penetration that collapses back in as “spoil”, blocking the hole created by previous weapons.  The estimate of 4 MOPs is based on the assumption of a modest amount of gravel spoilage, and less dense soil.  Higher soil density and gravel estimates could require 2-4 more bombs.\n\n \n\nBLS        Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nBEA       Bureau of Economic Analysis\n\nBP           British Petroleum\n\nBTU       British Thermal Unit\n\nCERA    Cambridge Energy Research Associates\n\nEIA         US Energy Information Agency\n\nE&P        Exploration and Production\n\nGAO       Government Accountability Office\n\nIEA         International Energy Agency\n\nOECD    Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\n\nOPEC     Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries\n\nSWIFT   Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication\n\n \n\nThe material contained herein is intended as a general market commentary.

Mr. Walton said they had been given 23 months due to the hurricanes\nand they were 5 months and 9 days beyond that. Mr. Ballentine asked how far out\nthey would be under the new rules. Mr. Walton said they would be given 24\nmonths which with the hurricane would be 25 months. Mr. Lynch said that at the\nend of that 24 month period, if they had not sought an extension of time within the\nrequired time period, no earlier than 6 months and no later than 45 days, before the\nexpiration of that 24 months, their project would have been shut down. Mr.\nWagner’s lack of knowledge of this particular situation would have become\nirrelevant because they would have been red tagged on the next day after the 24\nmonth period.

Mr. Walton corrected Mr. Hoffman,\nadvising there was a motion for a fine of $125.00 a day which failed and the fine\nthat was in effect was $250.00 a day.

Singapore is also unique in Southeast Asia\nbecause its rigorous standards of governance and zero tolerance for corruption make it\nvirtually impossible to bribe or openly suborn political leaders or opinion-leaders.\n\nIn 2016-17, Singapore’s generally friendly, smooth relationship with China took a\ndownturn. The proximate cause was Singapore becoming country coordinator for\nChina for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). This post is held\n\nby ASEAN member states by rotation for a three-year term. China seemed to have\nconvinced itself that the role entailed Singapore “coordinating” ASEAN’s position on\nthe South China Sea (SCS) territorial disputes in its favor. But China has long been\nunhappy with Singapore’s clear and consistent position on the SCS. Singapore is not a\nclaimant state to the South China Sea. The previous country coordinator was Vietnam,\na claimant state whose relationship with China has been historically fraught. Chinese\nexpectations of Singapore may have been unrealistically high, particularly after the\nArbitral Tribunal on the case brought by the Philippines against China ruled against\nChina’s position in a verdict in July 2016.\n\nChina criticized Singapore’s support for SCS disputes being resolved in accordance with\ninternational law as “taking sides.” It objected to Singapore’s leaders and officials even\nspeaking on the SCS issue. When Singapore stood firm on its right to state its position\non an issue of undoubted importance to the region, the Chinese influence apparatus\n\nAppendix 2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020632\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

For instance, a\nSMEPH vertex represents a collection of internal states that habitually occur in relation to\nsimilar external situations. A SMEPH edge represents a relationship between two SMEPH\nvertices (e.g. a similarity or inheritance relationship). The terminology \"edge /vertex” is\nused in this context, to distinguish from the “link / node” terminology used in the context\nof the Atomspace.\n\ne DeSTIN — Deep SpatioTemporal Inference Network: A specific CSDLN created by\nItamar Arel, tested on visual perception, and appropriate for integration within CogPrime.\n\ne Dialogue: Linguistic interaction between two or more parties. In a CogPrime context, this\nmay be in English or another natural language, or it may be in Lojban or Psynese.\n\ne Dialogue Control: The process of determining what to say at each juncture in a dialogue.\nThis is distinguished from the linguistic aspects of dialogue, language comprehension and\nlanguage generation. Dialogue control applies to Psynese or Lojban, as well as to human\nnatural language.\n\ne Dimensional Embedding: The process of embedding entities from some non-dimensional\nspace (e.g. the Atomspace) into an n-dimensional Euclidean space. This can be useful in an\nAI context because some sorts of queries (e.g. “find everything similar to X”, “find a path\nbetween X and Y”) are much faster to carry out among points in a Euclidean space, than\namong entities in a space with less geometric structure.\n\ne Distributed Atomspace: An implementation of an Atomspace that spans multiple com-\nputational processes; generally this is done to enable spreading an Atomspace across mul-\ntiple machines.\n\ne Dual Network: A network of mental or informational entities with both a hierarchical\nstructure and a heterarchical structure, and an alignment among the two structures so that\neach one helps with the maintenance of the other. This is hypothesized to be a critical\nemergent structure, that must emerge in a mind (e.g. in an Atomspace) in order for it to\nachieve a reasonable level of human-like general intelligence (and possibly to achieve a high\nlevel of pragmatic general intelligence in any physical environment).\n\ne Efficient Pragmatic General Intelligence: A formal, mathematical definition of general\nintelligence (extending the pragmatic general intelligence), that ultimately boils down to:\nthe ability to achieve complex goals in complex environments using limited computational\nresources (where there is a specifically given weighting function determining which goals\nand environments have highest priority). More specifically, the definition weighted-sums the\nsystem’s normalized goal-achieving ability over (goal, environment pairs), and where the\nweights are given by some assumed measure over (goal, environment pairs), and where the\nnormalization is done via dividing by the (space and time) computational resources used\nfor achieving the goal.\n\ne Elegant Normal Form (ENF): Used in MOSES, this is a way of putting programs in\na normal form while retaining their hierarchical structure. This is critical if one wishes\nto probabilistically model the structure of a collection of programs, which is a meaningful\noperation if the collection of programs is operating within a region of program space where\nsyntax-semantics correlation holds to a reasonable degree.

(And I suspect, to my parents, if they even bothered to think about\nit.) Everyone in the almost entire Jewish neighborhood (at least everyone who was part of the\nmodern Orthodox community) followed the rules. Few, I suspect, accepted the entire theological\nframework that included the literal truth of the bible, the resurrection of the dead, heaven and hell\n(which were not in the Jewish Bible) and the incorporeal nature of a single God. What we cared\nabout was the precise ingredients in a candy bar (no lard or gelatin), the number of steps you\ncould take if your yarmulkah fell off (more on this later), whether you could wear your house key\nas a tiepin to avoid the prohibition against carrying on the Sabbath, whether it was permissible to\nuse an automatic timer—a “shabos clock”—to turn on the TV for a Saturday afternoon World\nSeries game, or whether you could ride on an elevator on Shabos if it automatically stopped on\nevery floor and required no pressing of buttons. The rabbis answered these questions for us, but\nthey didn’t always agree. My mother had little patience with most of the local rabbis because her\nlate father, who was not a rabbi, “knew so much more than they did,” and always resolved\nreligious disputes by accepting the approach that was “easiest” and most adaptive to the modern\nlifestyle. Even my grandmother knew more than these “phony rabbis,” my mother would insist\ncontemptuously. My mother always said, “Respect people, not titles.” Then she was appalled\nwhen I showed disrespect for my frequently incompetent teachers!\n\nMost of the rules we were required to obey were negative ones: “Donts.” Don’t—eat unkosher,\ndrive or work on Shabas, eat anything on fast days, marry a non-Jew, eat ice cream after a hot\ndog, wear leather on Yom Kippur, talk after washing your hands but before making a “motzie”\nand eating the challah.\n\nMy grandmother—the enforcer—had a favorite Yiddish word: “meturnished’”—tt is forbidden to\ndo! She would shout it out in anticipation of any potential violation. If she saw you about to eat\na Nabisco cookie, she would intone the M word. If she saw you putting a handkerchief in your\npocket on Shabas, the word would ring in your ear. If you even thought about putting your\nyalmulkah in your pocket, you would hear the word. Once I began to whistle a tune. My musical\neffort was grated with a loud “meturnished.” “Why?” I implored. There’s nothing in the Torah\nabout whistling. “It is unJewish,” my grandmother insisted, “The Goyim whistle, we don’t.” It’s\nnow more than 30 years, since Grandma Ringel died, but the M word still rings in my ears every\ntime I indulge in a prohibited food or contemplate an un-Jewish activity (such as enjoying a\nWagnerian opera). Freud called it the “superego.” He must have had a Jewish grandmother too.\n\nOf course we tried to figure out ways around these prohibitions—half of Jewish law seems to be\ncreating technical prohibitions, while the other half seems to be creating ways around them.\nMuch like the Internal Revenue Code. No wonder so many Jews become lawyers and\naccountants. It’s not in our DNA; it’s in our religious training.\n\nA story from my earliest childhood illustrates the extraordinary hold that religion—really\nobservance of religious obligations—held over all of us.\n\nA few months before my brother was born, my father was holding my hand on a busy street, while\nmy mother was shopping. She had just bought me a new pair of high leather shoes—they went\n\nabove my ankles. For some reason, I bolted away from my father and ran into the “gutter.” My\nfoot was run over by an 18 wheeler truck.

Hoffman et al.\n\npublicized self-immolation, and not a breach of a threshold in, say, the quality of life\nof citizens or the level of corruption. This explanation requires simply that we rec-\nognize revolutions as a coordination problem (as argued in Morris & Shin, 2002;\nChwe, 2013), where each revolutionary chooses whether to revolt, and each is better\noff revolting only if sufficiently many others revolt.\n\nQuirks of Altruism and the Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma\nwith Incomplete Information\n\nThe Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma has famously been used as an explanation for\nthe evolution of cooperation among non-kin (Axelrod & Hamilton, 1981; Dawkins,\n2006; Pinker, 2003; Trivers, 1971). In this section, we show how the same basic\nmodel can be used to explain many of the quirky features of our pro-social prefer-\nences and ideologies.\n\nRecall that in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, each of two players simultaneously\nchooses whether to cooperate. Cooperation reduces a player’s own payoffs by c>0\nwhile increasing the other’s payoffs by b>c. The only Nash equilibrium is for nei-\nther player to cooperate. In the Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma, the players play a\nstring of Prisoner’s Dilemmas. That is, after the players play a Prisoner’s Dilemma,\nthey learn what their opponent did and play another Prisoner’s Dilemma against the\nsame opponent with probability 6 (and the game ends with probability 1-6). As is\nwell known in the evolutionary literature, there are equilibria in which players end\nup cooperating, provided 6>c/b. In all such equilibria, cooperation is sustained\nbecause any defection by one player causes the other player to defect. This is called\nreciprocity. As the reader is surely familiar, there is ample evidence for the Repeated\nPrisoner’s Dilemma as a basis for cooperation from computer simulations (e.g.,\nAxelrod, 1984) and animal behavior (e.g., Wilkinson, 1984). The model can be\nextended to explain contributions to public goods if, after deciding whether to con-\ntribute to a public good, players play a Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma (see, e.g.,\nPanchanathan & Boyd, 2004) (Fig. 5).\n\nThe key to understanding these quirks is that players often have incomplete\ninformation. For example:\n\n1. Players do not always observe contributions. It is intuitive that, for cooperation\nto occur in equilibrium, contributions need to be observed with sufficiently high\nprobability.\n\n2, Others cannot always tell whether a player had an opportunity to contribute. For\ndefection to be penalized, it must be the case that others can tell that a player had\nthe opportunity to cooperate and did not (.e. the player should not be able to hide\nthe fact that there was an opportunity to cooperate).\n\n3. Sometimes, there are two ways to cooperate, and one has a higher benefit, b.\nThen, the only way this more effective type of cooperation can be sustained in\nequilibrium is if others know which cooperative act is more effective.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015518\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In short, Iraqi politics was re-fragmenting along sectarian and\nethnic lines even before the protests began.\n\nUnderstood in this context, the Iraqi army’s killing of protesters in\nFallujah last month is a watershed event similar to the destruction of the\nAskariya shrine in Samarra in February 2006, though the crisis will not\nescalate as quickly. Sunni-Shiite tensions have hitherto played out in\npolitical forums. The key actors in today’s crisis are not the Sunni political\nleaders but, rather, Anbari tribal leaders, including Ali Hatem Ali\nSuleiman, one of the most powerful leaders of Iraq’s largest Sunni tribe.\nSuleiman and fellow leaders of the Dulaim tribe were essential to\nengineering the Anbar Awakening in 2007 and Sunni participation in the\ngovernment, for which they rejected al-Qaeda in Irag and renounced\nviolence against the state. They responded to the killings of protesters last\nmonth by threatening open war against the state for the first time since\n2007.

Meanwhile, any boost to emerging market\nexports from the modest pickup in global growth\nwe expect is likely to be dwarfed by ongoing US\ntrade policy uncertainty, European political risk\nand China fears. Lastly, an acceleration of recent\noutflows from EMLD markets could magnify these\nrisks, particularly since 60% of the cumulative\ninflows into the asset class since 2004 are\nexperiencing losses at current market levels.\n\nAlthough the number of concerns is large, so is\nthe risk premium of the asset class. As previously\nseen in Exhibit 76, the currencies in the EMLD\nindex are 15% undervalued. From this starting\npoint, the asset class could deliver attractive total\nreturns if US trade policy proves to be more benign\nthan feared and China worries abate.\n\nConsidering this balance of risks, our central\ncase calls for low single-digit returns. While\npositive, this return is not sufficient to justify\na tactical long position in EMLD in our view,\ngiven the still considerable downside risks\ndiscussed above.\n\nEmerging Market Dollar Debt\n\nEmerging market dollar debt (EMD) returned 10%\nin 2016, capping a surprising four-year period\n\nof outperformance that has greatly benefited\n\nfrom stable US rates and dollar strength. But the\nprospects for a fifth year of upside are questionable\nfor several reasons.\n\nFirst, EMD’s almost seven-year duration is\na liability in a rising-rate environment. This is\nparticularly true now that the Federal Reserve\nhas resumed tightening policy, a fact evident in\nEMD’s 4.3% drop in response to increasing rate\nhike expectations late last year. Second, with\nspreads standing near two-year lows, there is scope\nfor spread widening based on US and European\npolicy uncertainty and renewed China growth\nfears. Third, countries accounting for 37% of\nEMD— including Mexico, China, South Africa\nand Brazil—have negative outlooks from at least\ntwo rating agencies, raising the potential for\ndowngrades.! A potential default by Venezuela\nand its national oil company could also sour\nsentiment, as could unfavorable tariffs or trade\nrestrictions from the new US administration.\nFinally, the backup in interest rates we expect\ncould raise funding costs for EM corporate issuers,\nwhich could also heighten concerns about spillover\ninto EMD. Indeed, a recent stress test by Standard\n& Poor’s revealed that EM corporate borrowers—\nwho must repay $200 billion per year through\n2020'*°—are twice as susceptible to downgrades\nas US corporates if dollar funding costs rise by\na third.17?\n\nBased on the above, we do not recommend a\ntactical position in EMD at this time.\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 73\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014606\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

BROWN\nMiami Herald\n\nMIAMI —A court hearing on whether to\nunseal sensitive documents involving the alleged\nsex trafficking of underage girls by Palm Beach\nmultimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein — and the pos-\nsible involvement of his influential friends — will\nplay out in a New York City courtroom this week.\n\nBut it may happen behind closed doors, with\nthe news media and public barred — atleast in\npart.\n\nAn attomey for lawyer Alan Dershowitz wrote\na letter to the U.S. District Court Second Circuit\nof Appeals on Tuesday, asking whether the media\nshould be excluded from the proceeding because\nhis oral arguments on behalf of his client could\ncontain sensitive information that has been under\nseal.\n\nThe appeals court has not responded to his\nconcem as of Friday, but if the hearing is closed\nduring his lawyer's argument, it would represent\nthe latest in a long history of successful efforts to\nkeep details of Epstein'’s sex crimes sealed.\n\nDershowitz, a professor emeritus at Harvard,\nconstitutional law expert and criminal defense\nattorney, represented Epstein, who in 2008\nreceived what many consider an unusually light\nsentence for sexually abusing dozens of girls at\nhis Palm Beach mansion. Two women — one of\nwhom was underage — have said Epstein and\nhis partner, British socialite and environmentalist\nGhislaine Maxwell, directed them to have sex.\nwith Dershowitz, 80, and other wealthy, powerful\nmen. Dershowitz and Maxwell have denied the\nclaims.\n\nOral arguments are scheduled Wednesday to\nhear an appeal by the Miami Herald and other\nparties seeking to unseal a 2015 court case in-\nvolving Epstein and Maxwell. The Herald, as part\nof an ongoing investigation into Epstein’s case,\nhopes to shed more light on the scope of Ep-\nstein’s crimes, who else might have been involved\nand whether there was any undue influence that\ntainted the criminal justice process.\n\nA legal brief supporting the Herald's appeal\nwas filed in December by the Reporters Commit-\ntee for Freedom of the Press and 32 other media\ncompanies, including The New York Times,\n\nThe Washington Post, Dow Jones, Fox News,\nGannett, Politico, Reveal Center for Investigative\nReporting and Tribune Publishing Co.\n\nThe case — which was settled in 2017 —\ninvolved Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who sued\nMaxwell in federal court in the Southern District\nof New York in 2015. Giufire has asserted that\nMaxwell and Epstein trafficked her and other\nunderage girls, often at sex parties that Epstein\n\nFile phote by GETTY IMAGES\nAlan Dershowitz wants to keep the public, and news media, out of a hearing in New York this\nweek in which a judge is being asked to unseal sensitive documents involving Jeffrey Epstein\nand the alleged sex trafficking of underage girls.\n\nThe case — which was settled in 2017 — involved Virginia Roberts\nGiuffre, who sued Ghislaine Maxwell in federal court in the\nSouthern District of New York in 2015. Giuffre has asserted that\nMaxwell and Epstein trafficked her and other underage girls, often\nat sex parties that Epstein hosted at his homes in New York, New\nMexico, Palm Beach and the Virgin Islands.\n\nhosted at his homes in New York, New Mexico,\nPalm Beach and the Virgin Islands.\n\nMaxwell called Giuflre a liar, resulting in Gin\nfre suing for defamation.\n\nAs the case was litigated, the judge allowed a\nvast trove of documents, including testimony by\nwitnesses, to be sealed. Dershowitz, having been\npublicly implicated in Epstein’s crimes by Giuf-\nfre, tried unsuccessfully to get the judge to unseal\na select number of documents that he says will\nexonerate him. Blogger Michael Cernovich also\nfiled a motion to release a portion of the sealed\ndocuments.\n\nThe judge denied their motions in 2016, as the\ncase was still ongoing, saying that release of the\n\ndocuments could taint a potential jury pool.\n\nAfter the case was settled, the Herald filed a\nmore extensive motion, arguing that with the case\nnow closed, all the documents in the case should\nbe made public. The motion, filed in April 2018,\ncame as the Herald was working on an investiga-\ntive series, Perversion of Justice, which detailed\nhow Epstein and his lawyers manipulated federal\nprosecutors to obtain one of the most lenient sen-\ntences for someone who sexually abused children\nin history.\n\nDershowitz’s lawyer, Andrew G. Celli Jr,\nemphasized to the Herald that Dershowitz is not\ntrying to ban the media from the proceeding; he\nis simply giving the court a heads-up that his ar-\n\nguments could include information that has never\nbeen made public because it is under seal.\n\n“What the letter says very clearly is we intend\nto make reference to the sealed material in open\ncourt, so we want to notify the judges that this is\nmy intention to make my arguments,” Celli said.\n“We want the courtroom to be open so long as\nwe can argue the substance of what we want to\nunseal.”\n\nBarbara Petersen, executive director of the\nFirst Amendment Foundation, pointed out that\nsince the judges are well aware that sealed docu-\nments are at the heart of the appeal, Dershowitz’s\nrequest comes across more as a “veiled threat.”\n\n“It’s like ‘if you don't keep out the media, then\nwe are going reveal stuff and let the chips fall\nwhere they may, she said. “They don't want it to\ncome out and they don’t want to make a motion\nand ban the media, so they are hoping the judges\ndo it for them.”\n\nAttomeys for Giuffre want the case unsealed.\n\n“Ms. Giuffre is a victim of Jeffrey Epstein’s\nsex trafficking organization,” her attorney, Paul\nCassell, said in a statement attached to the Her-\nald’s appeal. “When she bravely came forward\nto explain what happened to her at the hands of\nEpstein and his powerful friends, Epstein’s ‘Ma-\ndame’ and girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, told\nthe world that Ms. Giuffre was a liar. Ms. Giuffre\nfiled a defamation action.”\n\nThe case was settled in Giuffre’s favor, with\nMaxwell paying Giuffre millions.\n\nMaxwell wants the case to remain sealed and\nearlier tried to get the judge to destroy the sealed\ndocuments, but her motion was denied.\n\nEpstein’s deal, brokered by then-Miami US.\nAttorney Alexander Acosta, allowed Epstein to\nplead guilty to two prostitution charges in state\ncourt, and in exchange, Epstein and an untold\nnumber of others were given federal immunity.\nEpstein served just 13 months in the county jail,\nalthough much of his incarceration was spent\nat his office in downtown west Palm Beach on\n“work release.”\n\nLast week, a federal judge ruled that Acosta,\nnow President Donald Trump's secretary of labor,\nviolated the law because he and other prosecutors\ndeliberately kept the deal secret from Epstein’s vic-\ntims, who are now in their late 20s and early 30s.\n\nCernovich’s lawyer, Marc J. Randazza, said he\nhas never seen a court seal nearly an entire court\nrecord like this.\n\n“T've seen partial seals, but I’ve never seen\nanything where it went quite that far. That in of it-\nself is newsworthy,” he said. “What kind of power\nhere is able to influence our court system in such\nabig way? Something is amiss and I’m glad that\njournalists are out there looking at it.”\n\nPERVERSION\n\nCONTINUED FROM PAGE 13\n\nwas taken of the two of them strolling in Manhat-\ntan. It was later revealed that Epstein had loaned\nthe prince's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, $24,000 to\npay off some debts. Ferguson later called the loan\na “gigantic error of judgment.”\n\nChanging the law\n\nCrime victims’ nights advocates have used\n\nthe Epstein case to strengthen the federal law\n\nin recent years, adding more precise language\nmandating that prosecutors notify victims about\nplea bargains and allow victims to be heard at\nsentencing.\n\nBecause some statute-of-limitation laws set\ndeadlines for filing civil and criminal sex crime\ncases, it’s difficult to bring them years later, said\nMarci Hamilton, a University of Pennsylvania\nprofessor who is working to ease those restric-\ntions across the country.\n\nBut she points out that there has been no stat-\nute of limitations for federal sex crimes involving\nchildren since 2002.\n\nChildren who are sexually abused often take\ndecades to reveal what happened to them, in part\nbecause their brains aren't wired at a young age\nto understand the trauma they've experienced,\nsaid Kenneth V Lanning, a retired FBI agent who\ninvestigated and studied child sex crimes for 40\n\n“We want to hold children to some\n\nsuperhuman standard because they behave\nthis way. In reality, police, prosecutors and\njudges have to understand that children are\nnot all angels from heaven. They are just\nplain human beings who are emotionally im-\nmature so we have to protect them from their\nown decisions.”\n\n“Really if you think about this too hard it’s\nscary because this is our government thatis sup-\nposed to protect us but has done everything to\nprotecta pedophile.” she said.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023000\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It contrasts with \"outer game\" -- 1.e., the things\na PUA says and does to attract women. A \"neg\" would count as \"outer game,\" for\nexample.\n\nMost successful PUAs reach a point where they decide that, in the words of one coach:\nemotionless \"sport-fucking kinda sucks.\" (Some PUAs start at this point, but that is a bit\nunusual.) They conclude that it's time to pull back from the game; to seek longer-term or\nmore emotionally connected sex; to examine their priorities; and to discover interests\naside from picking up new girls. Finding themselves in this way can be described as\n\"inner game.\" The men who discuss inner game often talk about developing their own\nbusinesses, exercising regularly, keeping a healthier diet, accepting their own\nvulnerabilities, pursuing hobbies, and improving their connections with people of all\ngenders.\n\nMost PUAs also realize that women respond well to genuine confidence and sense of\npurpose. This could be seen as ironic: notwithstanding the fact that \"inner game\"\nemphasizes self-improvement, the concept is still centered on seducing women.\nHowever, despite the fact that \"inner game\" is centered on gaming ladies, its ultimate\nresult is usually to encourage PUAs to think about what they really want from life. PUA\ncoach Mark Manson once wrote that, \"You don't end up in the Pick Up Artist community\nunless you are incredibly unhappy or unsatisfied about something. It may be conscious, it\nmay be unconscious. It may be short-term, or it may be deep-seated and long-term.\" He\nlater wrote to me by email that: \"This is a giant self-help community in disguise.” I also\nonce interviewed Neil Strauss himself, who said he hoped that his famous book The\nGame could become \"the beginning of a men's self-help movement -- because self-help\nisn't emasculating anymore if you're doing it to get laid.”\n\nInterestingly, Neil Strauss also told me that he agreed with feminism in many ways, and\nsaid things like: \"We still are a patriarchal society.\" Many feminists felt that my interview\nwith him was full of problematic statements, and his words were picked apart by feminist\nreaders. I do not disagree with many feminist critiques of what Strauss said -- but\nconsidering where Strauss was coming from, his words were extraordinarily supportive\nof feminism. One feminist commented to me that, \"I don't understand why you're not\nmore critical of this guy.\" In response, it is worth noting how an anti-feminist writer\nresponded to Strauss's words:\n\nWhether Strauss is an ignorant fool or an opportunist liar who wants to appease\nfeminists in order to avoid negative feedback is anyone's guess, but if his words are\nanything to go by, we can safely assume that the best-known public advocates of Game\nare perfectly OK with parroting feminist dogma.\n\nFor the few, mild pro-feminist statements Strauss made, some PUAs deride him as either\nan \"ignorant fool or an opportunist liar.\" (Others hurled particularly misogynist insults\nsuch as \"mangina.\") This is both a demonstration of how vitriolic PUA anti-feminist\nsentiment can become, and an example of the social shaming that sometimes leads men\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018667\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It argues that if\nI feel free and my actions do not appear constrained, then I am free\neven though my future might be inevitable: a sensation of freedom is\nsufficient. This seems rather feeble. I am seeking an explanation for\nhow we might be truly free to choose our actions, not some linguistic\ntrick to argue freedom is subjective.

Important part of human language might be the result in \na motivational need to discover/invent grammatical structure, which as a side effect makes us interested in \nmusic. \nIt would mean that Chomsky's life long hypothesis, that people have a special circuit for grammatical \nlanguage, is wrong.

I will spell out today's argument a bit better and cohesive \nwhen I get to it. Also, I should have recognized that the main point I tried to make would trigger Noam \n(who was as always very generous, patient, kind and humble on the personal level, even though he did not \nfeel like conceding anything on the conceptual one). Almost all of Noam's work focused on the idea that \nhumans have very specific circuits or modules (even when most people in his field began to have other \nideas), and his frustration is that it is so hard to find or explain them. \nI found Noam's hypothesis very compelling in the past. I still think that the idea that language is somehow a \ncultural or social invention of our species is wrong. But I think that there is a chance (we don't know that, \nbut it seems to most promising hypothesis IMHO) that the difference between humans and apes is not a \nvery intricate special circuit, but genetically simple developmental switches. The bootstrapping of cognition \nworks layer by layer during the first 20 years of our life. Each layer takes between a few months and a few \nyears to train in humans. While a layer is learned, there is not much going on in the higher layers yet, and \nafter the low level learning is finished, it does not change very much. This leads to the characteristic bursts \nin child development, that have famously been described by Piaget. \nThe first few layers are simple perceptual stuff, the last ones learn social structure and self-in-society. The \nswitching works with something like a genetic clock, very slowly in humans, but much more quickly in \nother apes, and very fast in small mammals. As a result, human children take nine months before their \nbrains are mature enough to crawl, and more than a year before they can walk. Many African populations \nare quite a bit faster. In the US, black children outperform white children in motor development, even in \nvery poor and socially disadvantaged households, but they lag behind (and never catch up) in cognitive \ndevelopment even after controlling for family income. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026409 \nGorillas can crawl after 2 months, and build their own nests after 2.5 years. They leave their mothers at 3-4 \nyears. Human children are pretty much useless during the first 10-12 years, but during each phase, their \nbrains have the opportunity to encounter many times as much training data as a gorilla brain. Humans are \nliterally smarter on every level, and because the abilities of the higher levels depend on those of the lower \nlevels, they can perform abstractions that mature gorillas will never learn, no matter how much we try to \ntrain them. \nThe second set of mechanisms is in the motivational system. Motivation tells the brain what to pay attention \nto, by giving reward and punishment. If a brain does not get much reward for solving puzzles, the individual \nwill find mathematics very boring and won't learn much of it. If a brain gets lots of rewards for discovering \nother people's intentions, it will learn a lot of social cognition. \nLanguage might be the result of three things that are different in humans: \n- extended training periods per layer (after the respective layer is done, it is difficult to learn a new set of \nphonemes or the first language) \n- more layers \n- different internal rewards. Perhaps the reward for learning grammatical structure is the same that makes us \nlike music. Our brains may enjoy learning compositional regular structure, and they enjoy making \nthemselves understood, and everything else is something the universal cortical learning figures out on its \nown. \nThis is a hypothesis that is shared by a growing number of people these days. In humans, it is reflected for \ninstance by the fact that races with faster motor development have lower IQ. (In individuals of the same \ngroup, slower development often indicates defects, of course.) \nAnother support comes from machine learning: we find that the same learning functions can learn visual \nand auditory pattern recognition, and even end-to-end-learning. Google has built automatic image \nrecognition into their current photo app: \nhttp://blogs.wsj . com/digits/2015/07/01/go o gle-mistakenly-tags-black-p eop le-as-gorillas-showing-limits-o f-\nalgorithms/  \nThe state of the art in research can do better than that: it can begin to \"imagine\" things. I.e. when the \nexperimenter asks the system to \"dream\" what a certain object looks like, the system can produce a \nsomewhat compelling image, which indicates that it is indeed learning visual structure. This stuff is \nsomething nobody could do a few months ago: \nhttp://www.creativeai.net/posts/Mv4WG6rdzAerZF7ch/synthesizing-preferred-inputs-via-deep-generator-\nnetworks  \nA machine learning program that can learn how to play an Atari game without any human supervision or \nhand-crafted engineering (the feat that gave DeepMind 500M from Google) now just takes about 130 lines \nof Python code. \nThese models do not have interesting motivational systems, and a relatively simple architecture. They \ncurrently seem to mimic some of the stuff that goes on in the first few layers of the cortex. They learn object \nfeatures, visual styles, lighting and rotation in 3d, and simple action policies. Almost everything else is \nmissing. But there is a lot of enthusiasm that the field might be on the right track, and that we can learn \nmotor simulations and intuitive physics soon. (The majority of the people in Al do not work on this, \nhowever. They try to improve the performance for the current benchmarks.) \nNoam's criticism of machine translation mostly applies to the Latent Semantic Analysis models that Google \nand others have been using for many years. These models map linguistic symbols to concepts, and relate \nconcepts to each other, but they do not relate the concepts to \"proper\" mental representations of what \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026410 \nobjects and processes look like and how they interact. Concepts are probably one of the top layers of the \nlearning hierarchy, i.e. they are acquired *after* we learn to simulate a mental world, not before. Classical \nlinguists ignored the simulation of a mental world entirely. \nIt seems miraculous that purely conceptual machine translation works at all, but that is because concepts are \nshared between speakers, so the structure of the conceptual space can be inferred from the statistics of \nlanguage use. But the statistics of language use have too little information to infer what objects look like \nand how they interact. \nMy own original ideas concern a few parts of the emerging understanding of what the brain does. The \n\"request-confirmation networks\" that I have introduced at a NIPS workshop in last the December are an \nattempt at modeling how the higher layers might self-organize into cognitive programs. \nCheers! \nJoscha \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

As late as 2015, prominent Chinese were asserting that the Ryukyu\nIslands, which include Okinawa, belonged as much to Beijing as they did to Japan. In\nlarge part, they based their argument on the fact that the chain was once a Chinese\ntributary state. The two countries still hotly contest this island chain, known as\nSenkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. “I am not saying all former tributary states\nbelong to China, but we can say with certainty that the Ryukyus do not belong to\nJapan,” wrote Luo Yuan, a retired and hawkish People’s Liberation Army general.’\nChinese scholars have argued that Japan’s annexation of the islands in 1879 was an\ninvasion and that the sovereignty of the island chain is thus open to question. For the\ntime being, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has not pressed this issue.\n\nHong Kong has long been a base for flag-waving Chinese activists agitating on the issue\nof the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. Their appeals to a notion of Chinese brotherhood,\ncombined with the fact the group writes in traditional Chinese characters, suggests\nthat the main consumers of the Organizing Committee for the Ryukyus propaganda\nmay not be on mainland China. Instead, the Organizing Committee may well be\ntargeting supporters of the Kuomintang in Taiwan, where hard core supporters of\nunification have become marginalized in mainstream politics, or overseas Chinese\ncommunities.\n\nIt is of some significance that the same individuals who make up the Organizing\nCommittee are also listed online as serving in CCP United Front Work Department\npositions in Hong Kong.? The Organizing Committee for the Ryukyus also has a robust\nonline presence, with both a website and a Weibo (similar to Twitter) account.* It is\nworth noting, also, that the Hong Kong-based campaign to regain the Ryukyus has not\nwon any overt or consistent support from Beijing.\n\nBut the Hong Kong patriots’ campaign has the benefit of being aligned with anti-\nJapanese sentiment in Okinawa itself, where both political leaders and the local media\nare antagonistic toward Tokyo. The local discontent is directly related to the long-\nstanding presence of tens of thousands of US military personnel stationed on the\nisland and the ways in which they have interacted with the indigenous population.\n\nOperating at arm’s length from the government, however, a cabal of self-styled\nChinese patriots in Hong Kong has openly agitated for the Ryukus (Senkaku/Diaoyu)\nto be taken from Japan and to become part of China.

US HG widened 7bp to 160bp, undoing around\nhalf of October’s peak-to-trough moves. Similar moves registered in other\nUSD credit markets. At 107bp, the CDX.IG is now back to early-August\nlevels, even as the CDS-Bond basis moved back into negative territory with\ncorporate bond spreads again moving above CDS.\n\nCredit spreads may be repricing the risk of a fiscal-cliff induced recession in\n2013. For context, we expect the eventual outcome of the negotiations to lead\nto about 2% of GDP in fiscal contraction, not enough to tip the economy back\ninto recession in itself, and considerably lower than the 4% drag under the full\nenactment of all revenue raising measures and spending cuts currently set to\nbecome law on Jan 1.\n\nFrom our point of view, the elections confirm the status quo both in\nWashington and in market conditions — i.e. we should expect more of the\nsame and it has been a great year for credit. Therefore, we see the current\ndip as an opportunity to add risk, and expect spreads to continue to tighten\ninto year end, albeit at a slower rate than in recent months. We stay down in\nquality and outline in GAZOS this week some relative value arguments for\nEuro HY vs US HY. On that front, European credit shrugged off the election\noutcome, tightening marginally in the HG space and widening very slightly in\nthe HY space.\n\nForeign Exchange\n\nThe post-US election drama is unfolding as expected. Four more years with\nthe same cast is delivering a higher USD versus most currencies but JPY due\nto deleveraging ahead of the fiscal cliff, and lower USD/CNY forwards due to\navoidance of US-China trade conflict (see An FX guide to America’s toss-up\nelection, FX Markets Weekly, Nov 2). The only surprise has been that FX\nvolatility remains so subdued (VXY unchanged at 7.4%) in a week when the\ntrade-weighted dollar and equity volatility have rallied. Chalk it up to\npositioning, as most indicators suggest that institutions investors entered the\nUS polls with aggregate USD positions close to flat.\n\nNow, sausage-making season begins. US recession is guaranteed if the fiscal\ncliff is enacted on schedule, and neither Congress nor the President welcomes\n\nJ.P Morgan\n\nMore details in ...\n\nUS Credit Markets Outlook and Strategy, Eric Beinstein\net al.\n\nHigh Yield Credit Markets Weekly, Peter Acciavatti et al.\n\nEuropean Credit Outlook & Strategy, Steven Dulake et\nal.\n\nEmerging Markets Cross Product Strategy Weekly, Eric\nBeinstein et al.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026574\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This innova-\ntion had provided President Obama and his national security team\nan edge of which our adversaries were unaware from 2008 to 2013.\nHowever, Snowden deliberately nullified this advantage in 2013 by\nrevealing this technology (which was published in The New York\nTimes and other newspapers). The vast number of documents that\nhe compromised contained many other secret sources and methods.\n\nThe full extent of the damage Snowden did may never be fully\nknown, even though the Department of Defense spent the better\npart of a year, and tens of thousands of investigative man-hours,\ntrying to sort out just the compromised sources and methods per-\ntaining to military and cyber-defense operations. In addition to the\ndirect and significant cost to taxpayers represented by this investiga-\ntion, one measure of how serious the loss has been was revealed by\nMichael McConnell, the vice-chairman of the company for which\nSnowden had worked at the time of the breach. McConnell stated\npublicly, “Snowden has compromised more capability than any spy\nin U.S. history.” McConnell had no obvious reason to exaggerate the\n\n® loss because his company, Booz Allen Hamilton, was partly respon- ©\nsible for the damage. It hired Snowden, as will be recalled, even after\nits vetters had detected an untruthful statement in his application.\nMcConnell said, “This will have impact on our ability to do our\nmission for the next twenty to thirty years.” By any measure, two\ndecades of lost intelligence is a steep price to pay.\n\nTo be sure, the practical value of peacetime intelligence about\nthe activities of adversary states is not always evident. What is far\nclearer to the public is the value of intelligence that can thwart ter-\nrorist attacks against subways, theaters, and other civilian targets.\nWe have seen that Snowden also deprived the NSA of much of the\neffectiveness of its PRISM program by revealing it, through the arti-\ncles published at his specific behest in The Guardian and The Wash-\nington Post that explained how it worked. This single revelation\ncompromised a system, duly authorized by Congress and the presi-\ndent, that had been the government’s single most effective tool for\nlearning in advance about attacks in America and Europe by jihadist\nterrorists.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 302 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019790\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In the first days he ordered\ntwo television screens in addition to the one already there, and a lock on the door,\nprecipitating a brief standoff with the Secret Service, who insisted they have access to the\nroom. He reprimanded the housekeeping staff for picking up his shirt from the floor: “If\nmy shirt is on the floor, it’s because I want it on the floor.” Then he imposed a set of new\nrules: nobody touch anything, especially not his toothbrush.

Also, he would let housekeeping know when\nhe wanted his sheets done, and he would strip his own bed.\n\nIf he was not having his six-thirty dinner with Steve Bannon, then, more to his liking,\nhe was in bed by that time with a cheeseburger, watching his three screens and making\nphone calls—the phone was his true contact point with the world—to a small group of\nfriends, among them most frequently Tom Barrack, who charted his rising and falling\nlevels of agitation through the evening and then compared notes with one another.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nBut after the rocky start, things started to look better—even, some argued, presidential.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 31, in an efficiently choreographed prime-time ceremony, an\nupbeat and confident President Trump announced the nomination of federal appellate\njudge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Gorsuch was a perfect combination of\nimpeccable conservative standing, admirable probity, and gold-standard legal and judicial\ncredentials. The nomination not only delivered on Trump’s promise to the base and to the\nconservative establishment, but it was a choice that seemed perfectly presidential.\n\nGorsuch’s nomination was also a victory for a staff that had seen Trump, with this\nplum job and rich reward in his hand, waver again and again.

One\nperson was explaining to another what aMOOC was, but he couldn’t remember what the letters stood for. As someone who\nregards himself as an amateur, ad-hoc, in-the-moment teacher, | felt compelled to help him out: “Massive. Open. Online.\nCourse.” He thanked me. Hehad been struggling to remember the “open” part of the MOOC message. And, even more\ninteresting, he had been struggling to remember the word “course.”\n\nOver the past few months, more and more clients and partners have been coming to me to deconstruct not just the acronym\nbut also the attributes of MOOCs. So often in fact that | have decided to write a short series on the subject. There are many\nthings to say about both the true impact and hype about MOOCs in the larger narrative that’s emerging about disruption in\neducation. But from where | sit, what’s most important to note about MOOCs in 2013 is something that the acronym does\nnot yet capture: the massive disruption we’re seeing in education will be online and offline, too.\n\nExperience\n\nThere are at least three reasons for this. And each of these reasons deserves at least one post, but I'll be super brief here.\nThe first is that the online experience of MOOCs will almost certainly evolve in a way that teachers, students, and staff will\nlook to find ways to meet with one another. This will either happen by design (by intent and with care) or it will happen\norganically. Almost certainly, the producers of MOOCs will look to do this with some sense of design, while leveraging the\norganic power of networks to grow by themselves. And if you have been following the evolution of MOOCs, you already\nknow that the online experience is still a work in progress. My business colleague, Chris Bennett — a behavior designer and\ngamification expert — and | recently spoke about this: many are stuck in the old paradigm of delivering education to the\nconsumer, rather than leveraging the greatest assets of the new medium (co-creation, crowdsourcing, collaboration). By\nredesigning the online experience to become more interactive, innovators in the MOOC world will see the possibilities for\noffline experience.\n\nInventory\n\nAnother reason for thinking about physical space: while the world ponders the impact that the costs of higher education will\nhave on schools that are struggling to compete, the inventory of quality physical space that becomes available will appeal to\norganizations that need it. A couple of years ago, | had the privilege of serving as an advisor to a White House initiative that\ntraveled the country meeting with leaders in large spaces in a network of state and community colleges. As a former\ntheater producer, | was impressed with the availability and quality of these spaces. In theater — and other kinds of shared,\nquasi-spiritual, transformative experience — physical space is everything. Innovators in the MOOC world will get wise — if\nthey haven't already — to the existence of networks of spaces (there are many different networks, as | will showin a later\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028643\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Hamad, indeed, lives across the\nstreet in a similarly furnished house—he and Epstein have the same decorator.\nEpstein, in his relaxed and amused manner, kept prodding: “Why are you financing\nthe bad guys? What do you get out of that?”\n\nThe Qatarians, in some mild diplomatic discomfort, seemed most worried\nthat their bid for the World Cup might be compromised by bribery allegations.\n\nAt 9:00 next morning, Epstein is joined for breakfast in the dining room by\nReid Weingarten, who’s represented among other fat cats in trouble, Worldcom’s\nBernie Ebbers and Goldman Sach’s Lloyd Blankfein and is one of attorney general\nEric Holder’s closest friends. Weingarten, horse, with a cold, and dejected, is just\nback from a failed defense of former Connecticut Governor John Rowland.\n\nAfter a blow by blow of the trial, there’s a discussion of the Qartarian’s\nvisit—Epstein is serving chocolate made from pistachios grown on the Sheikh’s\nfarm—and speculation about who actually controls ISIS.\n\n“Why?” I asked Weingarten, when Epstein briefly steps out of the room, “do\nsome many people keep coming back here, everything considered.”\n\n“Why we camp out here? I guess because there’s no place like it.”\n\nEpstein summons in the next person cooling his heels in the ante-room. It’s a\nyoung man named Brock Pierce, a former child actor, and dotcom high flyer—a\nprinciple in a gaming company called DEN, a notorious dotcom burnout, with its\nown sex scandal—who is now a leading investor in Bitcoin. He describe himself as\nthe “one of the most active investors in the field.”\n\nAnd, indeed, is the first clear explanation I actually get about Bitcoin. It is so\ngood that Epstein stops him and checks to see if his next appointment is here. And\nseconds later, Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and President of\nHarvard, enters the dining room. Summers, off Diet Coke, digs deep into the\nSheikh’s chocolates, focuses in on the Bitcoin investor.\n\n“Okay,” he says, after listening for a bit, “I have opportunities here. But an\nadditional feature of my decision problem roughly speaking is that the worst that\ncould happen to you is that you could lose all the money you put into it. Whereas I\ncould go from being seen as a figure of some probity and some intelligence to\nbeing a figure of much less intelligence and much less probity...”\n\n“Well,” says Pierce in some dramatic understatement, “it 1s true that you are\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022849\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

For example, those who have\n\nsuffered most in the former Yugoslavia have been the Croats and the Muslims. It\nwas they who Elie Wiesel risked his life to protect. Yet during the Holocaust,\nwhich took the lives of 6 million of Wiesel's people, the Croats were among the\nmost barbarous hands-on perpetrators of genocide against Jewish babies, women\nand men. The Islamic world has been in conflict with Elie Wiesel's people over\nIsrael, and many innocent Jews have been murdered by Islamic co-religionists of\nMuslims who have been terrorized in Sarajevo. Yet, Wiesel makes no distinctions\nbased on religion, race, creed or even enmity against his own people. He will\nbear witness, even at the risk of his life, to the suffering of any human\n\nbeings, so long as they are not the aggressors.\n\nTo be sure, Elie Wiesel speaks up on behalf of his people as well, with a\nvoice of unparalleled eloquence.\n\nA great Jewish sage once wrote, \"If I am not for myself, who will be for me?\nBut if I am for myself alone what am I? And if not now, when?\" Elie Wiesel lives\nby that tripartite philosophy. He is the voice of the Jewish people - their\ninternational moral spokesman. But he speaks not for Jews alone; instead, he can\nbe counted to combat hatred and bigotry regardless of who the victims may be.\nAnd for Elie Wiesel, tomorrow is never an excuse for not acting today.\n\nOver the years, we have worked closely together on issues relating to Soviet dissidents, the\nArmenian genocide, the massacres in Rwanda and Darfur, efforts to delegitimate Israel and other\nhuman rights concerns. I have sought his advice on many occasions, and it has always been wise\nand useful.\n\nIn 1982, Elie was asked to present me with the William O. Douglas Award by the Anti-\nDefamation League. In presenting the award, he paid me the highest compliment: “If there had\nbeen a few people like Alan Dershowitz during the 1930's and 1940's, the history of European\nJewry might have been different.” Although I have always believed that these words were highly\nexaggerated—no one could have stopped Hitler’s maniacal determination to kill the Jews of\nEurope—I have tried to hold myself up to his expectations of me. I recall his words every time I\nthink of slowing down or doing less to protect the victims of human rights abuses.\n\nIn 19 __, Elie and his wife, Marianne, invited me to their home in New York for an intimate dinner\nwith French President, Frangois Mitterrand. Elie and his wife speak fluent French but I do not\nand neither did the two other couples at the dinner. Mitterrand spoke passable English but he\ninsisted on conducting the entire conversation in French, with a British translator at his side. At\none point, Mitterrand told a joke in French. None of the French speaking people at the table\nlaughed. His translator then repeated it in English and everyone laughed hysterically.

It's been a traumatic experience. Mature adults are supposed to be\nresilient in the face of difficult challenges, but a person can bend only so far. That's why one sees an outraged\n\nResistance, moving from \"He's not my President\" to \"Is this even my country?\"\n\nIf as we often hear, America isn't a place on the map but an idea, the idea is in trouble. Every day I'm reminded\nof Sinclair Lewis's 1935 novel, Jt Can Happen Here, which imagined the election of a Fascist to the\npresidency. As tumultuous as the Thirties were, fascism didn't happen here. In fact, the New Deal and the\ninception of a social safety net came about. But reactionary forces simmer away when they aren't at a boil. Who\nwould have thought that the leader of the House in 2018 wants to weaken the social safety net by \"saving\"\n\nSocial Security and Medicare?\n\nA survey of 117 historians recently ranked Donald Trump the worst President in history, which seems right\nafter only one year in office. But what makes me feel like less of an American is knowing that 40% of my\nfellow citizens love and approve of him, who have reservations, yes, but overall want his agenda to move ahead.\nIn the daily fire hose of presidential offenses, little attention was paid to the revelation by Reince Priebus,\nformer White House chief of staff, that however chaotic this Presidency looked from the outside, it was worse\n\non the inside--fifty times worse.\n\nTrumpism is the product of collective consciousness, and although one hears about \"the wisdom of crowds,\" but\nwhen collective consciousness veers as close to lunacy as this administration, healing is the only answer.\nReactionary forces, racists, white supremacists, and haters are like algae on the surface of a pond. Algae only\nappears if the pond is dank and still. When water is clear and flowing, there is no condition for algae to thrive\n\nin.\n\nThe remedies for healing America are flowing with more force than before. Notions like Medicare for all, free\nhigher education, and bringing huge banks to heel were semi-fantasy in the last Presidential election. Now they\nare quickly moving mainstream. Ecological awareness is growing and unstoppable. There is a possibility that by\ndestroying America's self-image, Trumpism has opened the way for facing reality, which after all is better than\n\nliving up to a self-image that is hollow at the core.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026789\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Epstein\nTelephone interview with Virginia Roberts\nPage 3 of 23\n\nJS:\n\nJS:\n\nJS:\n\nJS:\n\nWhen you say that the room was hidden, Virginia, how was the room concealed?\n\nIt wasn’t like a door that you would normally go into, like some kind of special opening,\nyou open that and then a little door, so it looks like it’s a little closet so-to-speak, but\nwhen you walk in there, it’s obviously a lot bigger than just a closet. It wasn’t too big,\nbut it was bigger, you know. It wasn’t a gigantic room, it was just like a small room,\nwhich you know, it probably could fit some shoes in there, it had racks of shoes, boxes,\nsome sweatshirts neatly folded, and the ceiling to the floor was covered in pornographic\npictures of the girls that he had met.\n\nWhen you say...\n\nSo anyways, that was getting there, and I was introduced to Jeffrey, he was laying naked\non top of the massage table, and obviously for one, I’m a 15 year old girl and seeing him\non the table was weird but, also learning about anatomy and massage, I thought this\nwould be part of it. So obviously, I thought it was part of the massage program, so I said\nok, this is fine. And, he then instructed me on how to touch the body, Jeffrey’s body,\nhow to massage him, and for the first hour, it was actually a real massage, maybe not an\nhour, maybe like 40 minutes or something, but of something like that _and that’s when he\nturned over on the other side and to expose himself fully. So then Ghislaine told me that\nshe wanted me to undress and began to take off my shirt and skirt, my white uniform\nfrom Mar-A-Lago, she also took off her shirt and got undressed, and so I was there with\njust my undies on, and she was completely bare, and made some kind of little flake about\nthe underwear that I was wearing because it wasn’t my normal sexy girl underwear and\njust like, I don’t know, had red hearts on it or something like that; just your normal, you\nknow, real cute underwear. Anyways, so during all of this I’m kind of like what’s going\non, how do I act, what do I say, I was so afraid of, not afraid or fearful for my life but\n_unsure of how all this started and wanting to obtain a profession_ I was so aftaid\nthinking about upsetting and disappointing them, I don’t know, it’s a weird situation by\nfar and I was expected to Lick his nipples, instructed on how to do so by J.E_ and give\nhim oral sex while he wanted to fondle me, and then at the end, I was told by Ghislaine to\nget on top and straddle Jeffrey sexually, and when we were done, we went and had a\nshower in the room and Jeffrey told me to wash him up and down, you know with a bar\nof soap and make sure he was all cleaned up. And then he took me downstairs and took\nme to two of the guards and told John to bring me home. John was the butler at the time.\n\nLet me interrupt you for just a moment there if I could, Virginia. You mentioned as you\nwere recounting those details that you were 15 years old at the time. What is your date of\nbirth?\n\nAugust 9\", 1983\n\nAnd can you tell us please, as best you’re able to estimate it, what the date was when this\nfirst encounter occurred?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012109\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

That’s in huge contrast to normal AI, which requires millions of training\nexamples and is very sensitive to noise. By adding the appropriate background\nknowledge, you get much more intelligence.\n\nSimilar to the physical-systems case, if we make neurons that know a lot about\nhow humans learn from each other, then we can detect human fads and predict human\nbehavior trends in surprisingly accurate and efficient ways. This “social physics” works\nbecause human behavior is determined as much by the patterns of our culture as by\nrational, individual thinking. These patterns can be described mathematically and\nemployed to make accurate predictions.\n\nThis idea of a credit-assignment function reinforcing connections between\nneurons that are doing the best work is the core of current AI. If you make those little\nneurons smarter, the AI gets smarter. So, what would happen if we replaced the neurons\nwith people? People have lots of capabilities. They know lots of things about the world;\nthey can perceive things in a broadly competent, human way. What would happen if you\nhad a network of people in which you could reinforce the connections that were helping\nand minimize the connections that weren’t?\n\nThat begins to sound like a society, or a company. We all live in a human social\nnetwork. We’re reinforced for doing things that seem to help everybody and discouraged\nfrom doing things that are not appreciated. Culture is the result of this sort of human AI\nas applied to human problems; it is the process of building social structures by\nreinforcing the good connections and penalizing the bad. Once you’ve realized you can\ntake this general AI framework and create a human AI, the question becomes, What’s the\nright way to do that? Is it a safe idea? Is it completely crazy?\n\nMy students and I are looking at how people make decisions, on huge databases\nof financial decisions, business decisions, and many other sorts of decisions. What we’ve\nfound is that humans often make decisions in a way that mimics AI credit-assignment\nalgorithms and works to make the community smarter. A particularly interesting feature\nof this work is that it addresses a classic problem in evolution known as the group-\nselection problem. The core of this problem is: How can we select for culture in\nevolution, when it’s the individuals that reproduce? What you need is something that\nselects for the best cultures and the best groups but also selects for the best individuals,\nbecause they’ re the units that transmit the genes.\n\nWhen you frame the question this way and go through the mathematical literature,\nyou discover that there’s one generally best way to do this. It’s called “distributed\nThompson sampling,” a mathematical algorithm used in choosing, out of a set of possible\nactions with unknown payoffs, the action that maximizes the expected reward in respect\nto the actions. The key is social sampling, a way of combining evidence, of exploring\nand exploiting at the same time. It has the unusual property of simultaneously being the\nbest strategy both for the individual and for the group. If you use the group as the basis\nof selection, and then the group either gets wiped out or reinforced, you’re also selecting\nfor successful individuals. If you select for individuals, and each individual does what’s\ngood for him or her, then that’s automatically the best thing for the group. It’s an\namazing alignment of interests and utilities, and it provides real insight into the question\nof how culture fits into natural selection.\n\n137\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016940\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Some have argued that negotiations should\nexpand to a \"big for big\" format, but decades of mistrust between the\nUnited States and Iran make smaller deals more practical. Such an\napproach would have to focus on ending Iran's most problematic\nenrichment activity: processing uranium to the 20 percent threshold, which\nmakes the leap to weapons-grade material much easier. Instead, the regime\ncould limit itself to 5 percent enrichment, and under strict supervision by\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nThe intelligence community widely believes that although Iran has not yet\ndecided to make a nuclear weapon, it is still moving to acquire all the\nnecessary capabilities in case it chooses that path. Accordingly,\nWashington will need to obtain a concrete Iranian commitment to convert\nits stocks of readily upgradeable gaseous uranium into metallic fuel\nelements, which pose significantly less of a threat. A serious inspection\nsystem would need to be implemented in order to monitor these\nrequirements. In return, the Iranians would expect the lifting of nuclear-\nrelated sanctions. They would also likely ask for acknowledgement that\nthey have the right to continue their civil enrichment program, whether for\nsupposed use in cancer treatment or to safeguard against a potential\nRussian decision to cease fueling the Bushehr reactor.\n\nThus far, President Obama has been frustrated at the lack of progress in\nresponse to his openness toward the Iranian regime, and his new cabinet\nhas an obligation to help him solidify a negotiating position that improves\nthe situation.

You would not be able\nto do a competing book or documentary before then. This is not to say that they shouldn't be pursued. In a\nsense, better that they know what Patterson's position is and, a year from now say, be able to counter it. I have\nsome thoughts on book and doc to share at your convenience.\n\nThat being said, you do need an immediate counter narrative to the book. I believe Trump offers an ideal\nopportunity. It's a chance to make the story about something other than you, while, at the same time, letting you\nframe your own story. Also, becoming an anti-Trump voice gives you a certain political cover which you\ndecidedly don't have now. Still, this necessary involves you going public. And so the most basic decision is\nabout your willingness to do that. My view is that in a couple of weeks you could master message and technical\nproficiency. I know a bunch of people who could be very helpful here. This would involve something along the\nlines of you writing an op-ed, doing a high profile television interview (Charlie Rose, I'd say), and perhaps\nsome social media efforts.\n\nSpeaking of which, again, I think a strategic plan, involving your public identity, philanthropic activities and\ninterests, and the development of media allies, ought finally to be put in place. A big, comprehensive, expensive\neffort.\n\nThe alternative is to continue to keep head down and hope Patterson book is just more he-said she-said and\nConnolly getting lost in the reeds (which, as an inveterate conspiracist, he always does). My worry is that\nPatterson can be counted on to produce a bestseller, and while he isn't regarded as a serious writer, he'll surely\nbe unloading a lot of tabloid copy. Because this will be tied to the election, the Trump-Clinton angle will amp\nup the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've encountered\nbefore.\n\nMeanwhile--\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032246\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Buschel \nCc: \nBcc: \nSubject: Sam Fields on 302 Interview \nBroward Probe: 302 Reasons Not To Talk To The FBI \nBY SAM FIELDS \nGuest Columnist \nActually, there are not 302 reasons. There is but one and it is called in federal court \"\"The 302\". It \ncould screw the innocent and the unwary. \nThe newspapers and Browardbeat.com make clear that the Federal investigations that led to the arrests \nof County Commissioner Josephus Eggleston, former Miramar Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman and \nSchool Board member Bev Gallagher are just beginning. \nThe FBI will be interviewing everyone from County Administrator Bertha Henry to bus drivers about \nanything and everything. \nThey are looking for scalps. \nI suspect that if the average person thought about it, he would assume that when the FBI comes calling, \n.like Joe Friday from DRAGNET, they \"want the facts and nothing but the facts.\"\" Equally important \nthey want an accurate record of that interview so they bring a court reporter or at the very least a tape \nrecorder. \nThe average person would be wrong. \nAgents bring a pencil and pad to take notes. They then prepare a summary of the interview called a \n\"302 Report.\" \nIf you are called as a witness at trial, prior to testifying, you will be given a copy of \"Your 302\" to \nreview. It is a record of what the FBI insists you said at your previous meeting. \nIf your interview lasted more than thirty seconds, it is guaranteed you will fmd numerous discrepancies. \nSome of them will be insignificant; some of them could be material. \nfile:///Cl/Documents`/020and%20Settings/Trial/Desktop/E...uction/eDocs/eMail/Grant Smith080178^eMailContent.htm (1 of 5) [11/6/2010 10:16:54 PM] \n14545 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030945 \nGrant_Smith080178^eMailContent.htm \nAsk two people to listen to you in a discussion about a traffic accident and then write a summary. It is a \nguaranteed they will have differences with each other as well as with you, the witness. \nYou said, \"I am reasonably sure that the traffic light was green\"\". \nOne report takes out the equivocation and quotes you as saying: \"The light was green.\" \nThis brings us to Federal law 18 USC 1001. That statute makes it a felony to lie to the government. And \nguess who decides whether or not you were lying? The government. \nSo here is your conundrum. Do you testify about your doubts about the light, which is the truth, or do \n-----------------------------------------------you adopt the \"302\" version to avoid the wrath of the FBI? \nWhether or not the \"302\" discrepancies are a result of stupidity or cupidity makes no difference. \nTestify in opposition to the \"302\" and you are in the crosshairs of the Feds. \nIf they believe your testimony cost them the case, the next thing you likely to hear from the FBI will be: \n\"Please place your hands behind your back.\" \nA number of years ago, fed up with the 302 Two Step, I turned the tables on them. \nIn a high profile case, my client was asked to submit to an FBI interview at their offices in North Miami \nBeach. \nFeigning naivety, I asked where the court reporter was. I was told there was no court reporter. \nI then asked where the tape recorder was. \nI will always be impressed that the agent was able to give us the response he did without laughing. He \nsaid the FBI could not tape the interview because they did not have \"enough money in their budget.\" \nIt was time to play the Trump Card. \nAt that point, I removed a cassette recorder from my pocket and explained that my client had been able \nto scrape together the 59 cents for a cassette tape. Further we would pay for the tape to be transcribed \nand supply them with a free copy of everything. \nYou could've heard a fart in a vacuum. \nThey now made it clear thaf no way, no how would any FBI interview be recorded. So we went forward \nwith the interview as the agent took notes. \nMonths later the client was called to testify at trial. \nI warned him the \"\"302\" would be a work of fiction. It was. I was sitting in the back of the courtroom. \nfile:NCl/Documents%20and%20Settings/Trial/Desktop/E...uction/eDocs/eMail/Grant_Smith080178^eMailContentlatrn (2 of 5) [11/6/2010 10:16:54 P1V11 \n14546 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030946 \nGrant_S*th080178^eMailContent.htm \nCalled to the stand, he told the \"\"real\"\" truth and not the \"302\" version of the truth. The Assistant U.S. \nAttorney was frustrated and kept on confronting him with the \"302\" version. \nFed up with the prosecutor and in the presence of the jury, the witness preceded to recount my debate \nover recording from the first interview. Pointing to me in the back of the courtroom, the witness \nannounced that I had warned him that they would pull this crap with the \"302\" report. \nIt didn't take the jury very long to acquit. \nWith the advent of DNA and groups like the Innocence Project, we have now seen that so-called \nunrecorded confessions have put many innocent people in jail and even on Death Row. As a result, \nagencies such as the BSO, now require all interviews to be taped. \nBut not the FBI. \nLike anyone, including lawyers, the FBI wants to control the record of the interview. Taping hurts that \neffort. \nI'm not saying that it is FBI policy to step over the line. But they have chalk on their shoes more often \nthan you can imagine. \nSo, what's should you do if the FBI comes calling? \nFirst of all, the advice I am about to give is not for the a guy who was an inadvertent witness to a bank \nrobbery. \nI am talking about people who are being interviewed as part of the types of crimes that are best \ndescribed as corruption, RICO, white collar, etc. \nThose are the kinds of cases that involve tons of evidence. Giving an innocent, but incorrect answer to a \nvague question could leave any of us in deep CaCa. \nA case in point is the lead story in the September 26, 2009 Herald. Chris Walton, director of the \nBroward County Transportation Department, was interviewed by two FBI agents. \nHe stated that they wanted to know if \"commissioners attempted to influence contracts.\" \n\"I told them no.\" \nIt may sound like a simple straight forward Q-and-A but it ain't necessarily so. He may think his \ninterview and public statement ends the matter. \nIn actuality, he has thrown down the gauntlet in front of the FBI. \nStart out with the understanding that the FBI is not investigating to see if there is crime and corruption in \nfile:///Cl/Documents%20and%20Settings/Trial/Desktop/E,..uction/eDocs/eMail/Grant Smith080178^eMailContent.htm (3 of 5) [11/6/2010 10:16:54 PIVI] \n14547 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030947 \nGrant_Smith08017VeMai;Content.htm \nBroward County government.

Snowden supplied them in written answers\nto interrogatives sent to him by Poitras and Appelbaum in May\n2013 while he was still on the NSA payroll. He also carefully orches-\ntrated the exposure of the PRISM surveillance programs, precisely\nspecifying, as Greenwald writes in his book No Place to Hide, who\nwas to release the “scoops” in which newspapers. He gave Gellman a\nseventy-two-hour ultimatum for exposing PRISM, as we know. He\nfurther provided Poitras with well-organized files for publications\nrevealing, among other things, that the NSA had paid RSA, a lead-\ning computer security provider, to build flawed encryption protocols,\nwhich allowed the NSA to read encrypted messages on computers\nand online video games. In short, he used these journalists to accom-\nplish his purpose. In light of the way he micromanaged the leaks, it is\ndifficult to conclude that he did not deliberately plan to compromise\nand render useless these U.S. and British operations.\n\nWhatever he intended, he clearly succeeded in blowing the cover\noff NSA‘s operations authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Sur-\n\n© veillance Act for monitoring terrorists’ activities. After all, terrorist ©\ngroups are no different from other criminal enterprises in their need\nto keep their communications secret from the authorities pursuing\nthem. If they find out that the police are tapping their phone lines or\nintercepting other channels of communication, they can be expected\nto either stop using them or use them to divert attention away from\ntheir real plans.\n\nIn addition, Snowden suggested an alternative means to those who\nwanted to evade government surveillance. He recommended that\nthey use end-to-end encryption, which results in messages being\nencrypted before they are sent over the Internet. He told Greenwald,\nfor example, that encryption was “critically necessary” for anyone\nto evade NSA surveillance. Just as Robert Hanssen had deliberately\ncompromised the NSA’s interception of Soviet communications in\nWashington, D.C., in the 1990s, Snowden deliberately compromised\nthe NSA’s interception of concealed messages by potential terrorists\non the Internet.

Much of the morning involved a series of charges and\ncountercharges—a _ rocks-and-bottles combat, with a seemingly hands-off police force\nstanding by.\n\nIn Bedminster, there was still little awareness of the unfolding events in Charlottesville.\nBut then, at about one o’clock in the afternoon, James Alex Fields Jr., a twenty-year-old\nwould-be Nazi, plunged his Dodge Charger into a group of counterprotesters, killing\nthirty-two-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring a score of others.\n\nIn a tweet hurriedly composed by his staff, the president declared: “We ALL must be\nunited & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in\nAmerica. Lets come together as one!”\n\nOtherwise, however, it was largely business as usual for the president—Charlottesville\nwas a mere distraction, and indeed, the staff’s goal was to keep him off North Korea.

If you wanted to\ncalculate something complex, you had to employ a computer: a person\nwho could do mental arithmetic enormously fast.

The question was:\nCould a computer, either mechanical or human, blindly follow known\nrules to decide all mathematical questions?

His son died young\nand Diophantus was so consumed by grief he retreated into mathematics.\nHe left us seven books of mathematical puzzles — some he devised himself\nand some of them taken from antiquity. The puzzles look deceptively\nsimple and are all based on equations using whole numbers. His most\nfamous puzzle is set in a poem which tells how old Diophantus was when\nhe died. Can you solve it?\n\n“Here lies Diophantus,; the wonder behold. Through art algebraic,\nthe stone tells how old: ‘God gave him his boyhood one-sixth of\nhis life, One twelfth more as youth while whiskers grew rife; And\nthen yet one-seventh ere marriage begun; In five years there came\na bouncing new son. Alas, the dear child of master and sage, after\nattaining half the measure of his father’s age, life chill fate took him.\nAfter consoling his fate by the science of numbers for four years, he\nended his life.”\n\nDiophantine puzzles look straightforward. Hilbert asked if these\n\nproblems could be solved by a mechanical procedure, in modern terms,\nby an algorithm.

But,\nof course, he had family status, carrying its own high authority. In addition, he had\nbillionaire status. He had cultivated a wide range of New York and international money\npeople, Trump acquaintances and cronies, and, often, people whom Trump would have\nwished to like him better than they did. In this, Kushner became the representative in the\nWhite House of the liberal status quo. He was something like what used to be called a\nRockefeller Republican and now might more properly be a Goldman Sachs Democrat. He\n—and, perhaps even more, Ivanka—was at diametric odds with both Priebus, the stout-\nright, Sun Belt-leaning, evangelical dependent Republican, and Bannon, the alt-right,\npopulist, anti-party disruptor.\n\nFrom their separate corners each man pursued his own strategy. Bannon did all he\ncould to roll over Priebus and Kushner in an effort to prosecute the war for\nTrumpism/Bannonism as quickly as possible. Priebus, already complaining about\n“political neophytes and the boss’s relatives,” subcontracted his agenda out to Ryan and\nthe Hill.

Walsh understood that Bannon provided the president\nwith inspiration and purpose, while the Priebus-Ryan connection promised to do what to\nTrump seemed like the specialized work of government. For his part, Kushner best\ncoordinated the rich men who spoke to Trump at night, with Kushner often urging them to\ncaution him against both Bannon and Priebus.\n\nThe three advisers were in open conflict by the end of the second week following the\nimmigration EO and travel ban debacle. This internal rivalry was the result of stylistic,\nphilosophic, and temperamental differences; perhaps more important, it was the direct\nresult of the lack of a rational org chart or chain of command.

Genetic engineer George\nChurch, a pioneer of the revolution in reading and writing biology, is central to this new\nlandscape of ideas.

At the same time, he never loses sight of the AI-\nsafety issue. On that subject, he recently remarked: “The main risk in AI, to my mind, is\nnot so much whether we can mathematically understand what they ’re thinking; it’s\nwhether we re capable of teaching them ethical behavior.

It was a book: “Math for idiots.”\n\nSo he is not without humor, even though he doesn’t drink or smoke, and hates restaurants.\n\n“Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects,” newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He\nwas certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few\nmoments in his company and you know this to be true.\n\nWhen I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that\n“Andy’—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his\nstrange title is. Because if one thing’s for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what\nhe’s talking about far more than “Andy” does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other\nfinanciers hang out with him.\n\nAnd Ghislaine?\nFull disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It’s almost impossible not to.\n\nShe is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I’ve spent hours\ntalking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is\ncurious. She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent\nme a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else’s I can think of—probably even\nRupert Murdochs’. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill\nClinton with whom she is close friends.\n\nYet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 4oth birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-\nPlatero, (known fondly to her close friends as “the Tennis Goddess”) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When\nit comes down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability.\nAnd that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey.\n\n“He saved her,” I remember a close friend of mine telling me. “When her father died, she was a wreck;\ninconsolable. And then Jeffrey took her in. She’s never forgotten that—and never will.”\n\nIn many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect\nreplacement for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his\nsexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine’s father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving\na massive “black hole” he’d fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that\nstrange.\n\nIn fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful\npeople in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl\nissues, and moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You\ndon’t tend to get to the top by being the world’s most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett\ndidn’t quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second “wife” for many years whose existence he\nhas been open about.\n\nSo what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven’t spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her\nloyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look\nat Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for\nall sorts of blemishes.\n\nOn Tue, Mar 8, 2011 at 6:10 AM, <i > wrote:\n\nThanks.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030479\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Labor must be the party of those people who gained from the pro-\nmarket growth economy that we created. Labor must be open to the influences of this middle class, to people on\nhigher incomes.

It turned inwards on itself, away from the community.\n\n\"At the operating level it's become the party of insiders,\" Keating says. \"The problem is that members get too caught\nup in the gift of faction managers and they get caught up in the false construct of popularity, the false god.\"\n\nFixated by the nature of political leadership, Keating's book After Words shouts out: \"The great curse of modern\npolitical life is incrementalism.\"\n\nLeaning across the table he says to me that briefing notes and economic texts aren't enough: the leader must locate\nhis own source of higher command and inner belief. He laments the efforts of US President Barak Obama and\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel in the teeth of contemporary challenges.\n\n“There is nothing preordained about American decline any more than the European project is destined to fail,\" he\nwrites.\n\n\"But the portents are not good. Despite the rhetoric, President Obama conducts himself as an arbitrator or mediator\nbetween the competing strands of American economic and political ideology. He repeatedly eschews striking out,\nsnatching the naked flame and hanging on. But the cost of this strategy is not simply a cost to him; it is a cost to the\nwhole world.\n\n\"On the other hand, Chancellor Merkel is the archetypal worry-wart. She does not lead; she assesses.\n\n\"You really wonder why leaders want these jobs when they really do not want to lead. And what is their risk? That\nBarack Obama will not get a second term? Or that Angela Merkel's coalition might finally end up on the rocks? If\nthey actually made the leap they might astound themselves. Because, in the end, everyone in political life gets\ncarried out - the only relevant question is whether the pallbearers will be crying.\"\n\nFor Keating, the 20th-century leader exerting most influence on the coming century is China's Deng Xiaoping.\n\n\"If you look at the other figures of the century, Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin and Mao, none will leave the legacy in\nterms of the 21st century that Deng leaves,” he says. \"He walked away from the ideology of the Communist Party\n\njust as effectively as Mikhail Gorbachev walked away from the essence of the Soviet Union.\"\n\nBy 2050 Keating sees a world order with nations in terms of gross domestic product in this hierarchy: (1) China, (2)\nUS, (3) India, (4) Japan, (5) Brazil, (6) Russia, (7) Britain, (8) Germany, (9) France and (10) Italy.\n\nThe key, however, is that Japan lags a distant fourth behind the top three.\n\nOn America, Keating is dismayed by the pivotal change in its outlook after the end of the Cold War. “When the\nBerlin Wall came down the Americans cried victory and walked off the field,” he says.\n\n\"Yet the end of the Cold War offered the chance for America to develop a new world order. It didn't know what to do\n\nwith its victory.

There\nseems little doubt that a human’s intelligence is highly conditioned by the particularities of the\nhuman body.\n\n9.6.1 The Human Sensorium\n\nHere the requirements seem fairly simple: while surely not strictly necessary, it would certainly\nbe preferable to provide an AGI with fairly rich analogues of the human senses of touch, sight,\nsound, kinesthesia, taste and smell. Each of these senses provides different sorts of cognitive\nstimulation to the human mind; and while similar cognitive stimulation could doubtless be\nachieved without analogous senses, the provision of such seems the most straightforward ap-\nproach. It’s hard to know how much of human intelligence is specifically biased to the sorts of\noutputs provided by human senses.\n\nAs vision already is accorded such a prominent role in the AI and cognitive science literature\n— and is discussed in moderate depth in Chapter 26 of Part 2, we won’t take time elaborating\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013087\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The ideas\nof the previous chapter, regarding the connection between a human-like intelligence’s internals\nand its environment, result from exploring the implications of this adaptation in the context\nof the cognitive synergy concept. In this chapter we explore the mind-world connection in a\nbroader and more abstract way — making a more ambitious attempt to move toward a \"general\ntheory of general intelligence.\"\n\nOne basic premise here, as in the preceding chapters is: Even a system of vast general\nintelligence, subject to real-world space and time constraints, will necessarily be more efficient\nat some kinds of learning than others. Thus, one approach to formulating a general theory of\ngeneral intelligence is to look at the relationship between minds and worlds — where a \"world\"\nis conceived as an environment and a set of goals defined in terms of that environment.\n\nIn this spirit, we here formulate a broad principle binding together worlds and the minds that\nare intelligent in these worlds. The ideas of the previous chapter constitute specific, concrete\ninstantiations of this general principle. A careful statement of the principle requires introduction\nof a number of technical concepts, and will be given later on in the chapter. A crude, informal\nversion of the principle would be:\n\nMIND-WORLD CORRESPONDENCE-PRINCIPLE\n\nFor a mind to work intelligently toward certain goals in a certain world, there should be a\nnice mapping from goal-directed sequences of world-states into sequences of mind-states, where\n\"nice\" means that a world-state-sequence W composed of two parts W, and Wo, gets mapped\ninto a mind-state-sequence M composed of two corresponding parts M, and Mo.\n\nWhat’s nice about this principle is that it relates the decomposition of the world into parts,\nto the decomposition of the mind into parts.\n\n177\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013093\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

(Including the two she\nwon for Moulin Rouge, she now has four).\n\nEven Madonna has sponsors now. The\nmaterial girl—blinding in 1,000 carats of Neil\nLane’s diamonds—hosted her seventh annual\nawards bash at her manager Guy Oseary’s\nhome with Gucci. Originally super secret, the\nparty is now a headline on Page Six. Madonna\nmade her best effort to cream off the stars\nfrom Graydon’s party.\n\nIn attendance were Paul McCartney, Tom\nBrady and Gisele Biindchen, newly engaged\nAshton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, Serena\nWilliams, Prince, and Pink.

(Neuroimaging will\nenable good visual images for the TV series without extra costs.)\n\nPatrick stresses that while these breakthroughs form, for the first time, a solid foundation for understanding\nsleep and dreams, they also open opportunities to dig deeper into the “purpose” of sleep and dreams, as well\nas engender a new series of questions and directions (e.g., clinical treatments of illnesses).\n\nAttached is Patrick’s quick compiling of summaries of a few recent leading research papers (2009 — 2017,\nespecially 2015-2017).\n\nYou’d enjoy speaking with him, if you want.\nLove to do this series together with you.\nMuch appreciate and warm regards,\n\nRobert\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.

You might ask what runs the operating system and that is a\nsmaller program called the BIOS. What runs BIOS? An even smaller\nprogram called the Bootstrap. Once all this is up and running you have a\nworking computer, which can run any program you throw at it.\n\nThe problem with programs is they tend to crash — usually at\nthe most inconvenient times. It is often not clear whether a program\nhas truly crashed. It might be stuck in an infinite loop, or it could be\ncalculating the answer to a complex question, such as the answer to life,\nthe Universe, and everything. How would we know? If only I had waited\na little longer before rebooting, the program would have run to its end\nand given me the answer to Douglas Adams’ question.\n\nIt would be very useful, and save a great deal of time, if I had a way\nof telling whether a program will ever stop. An elegant solution would be\nto have a second program called “Halt, which would test the program and\noutput ‘will halt’ or ‘will crash’ as appropriate. It turns out this program\nwould be more than just useful. It could be used as an oracle, capable of\nanswering almost any question imaginable.\n\nI could, for example, write a program that says: for every index in\nFermat’s puzzle try every number and halt if you find a solution greater\nthan 2. Now if I run my halt program on this program and it states ‘will\ncrash; I will have solved Fermat’s Last Theorem! Do you see why?\n\nIf we give ‘Halt’ an input: a program we are interested in, along with\nsome data, it will tell us if the program finds an answer. If I am trying to\nsolve Fermat’s Last Theorem, we will ask it to try every possible index for\nthe equation 3*+4*=5* and halt when it finds a true result greater than 2.\nIf the halt program says yes and halts, you can trace through the program\nand work out how it did it. The theory would be proved. If the program\nsays no, the theory is disproved. This gives us a way to discover proofs of\nmany mathematical theorems.\n\nI could try almost any puzzle using a program with this form. All I\nneed do is put a problem in the following decision format: try all possible\noptions, and then stop and ring a bell if a solution is found. The Halt\nprogram would then give the result leading to untold riches, winning all\nthe remaining Clay Mathematics prizes at the very least and earning me\n$6m.\n\nDoes such a magical program exist? The answer, sadly, is no. There\nis no Halt program and the final part of Turing’s paper proved there can\nnever be.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015915\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

[Vol. 104\nof court hearings and to attend those hearings.'*’ So it is instructive to\nnotice that the Justice Department policy is to extend certain rights to\nsuspected criminals during certain points in the investigative process. That\npolicy might provide guidance on when crime victims’ rights would attach.\n\nOf particular interest here is the Department’s policy for grand jury\nsubpoenas issued to a “target” of a criminal investigation. When such a\ntarget is subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury, the Department of\nJustice will advise that target of his rights, such as the right to refuse to\nanswer any question that might be incriminating.'*® The Department of\nJustice defines a “target” of a criminal investigation as “a person as to\nwhom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him\nor her to the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of the\nprosecutor, is a putative defendant.”!*”\n\nIf the Department’s investigation has coalesced sufficiently so that it\ncan provide notice of rights to putative defendants, it should likewise be in\na position to provide notice of rights to that defendant’s victims.\nCombining the Department’s definition of “target” with the CVRA’s\ncoverage and definition-of-victim provisions produces a formulation\nwhereby CVRA rights attach in (at least) the following circumstances:\n\nCVRA rights attach when an officer or employee of the Department of\nJustice or any other department or agency of the United States engaged in\nthe detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime has substantial\nevidence that an identifiable person has been directly and proximately\nharmed as a result of the commission of a federal offense or an offense in\nthe District of Columbia, and in the judgment of the officer or employee,\nthat person is a putative victim of that offense.\n\nThis formulation borrows from the CVRA’s coverage provision!”° to\ndefine the relevant universe of substantial evidence as that in the possession\nof the Justice Department or other federal agencies. For instance, if state\nlaw enforcement officers are investigating a bank robbery, the fact that the\nrobbery might also be prosecuted federally'*! does not make the teller at the\nbank a federal “victim” of the crime until evidence regarding the crime\ncomes into the possession of a federal agency. The formulation also tracks\nthe CVRA’s definition of “victim” in limiting the universe of potential\n\n187 See, e.g., Cassell, supra note 15, at 1376-85 (describing the rationale underpinning\nstate victims’ rights statutes).\n\n188 CRIMINAL RESOURCE MANUAL, supra note 87, § 9-11.15].\n\n189 Tq.\n\n190 18 U.S.C. § 3771(e) (2012).\n\n191 Td. § 2113.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014071\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Ehud, I want you to check what can be\ndone. Take whatever you need, from wherever you want. Bring me suggestions\nby seven tomorrow morning.” Then, he said, we would go brief the Defense\nMinister, Shimon Peres.\n\nI assembled a team the same way we’d prepared for special-operations\nmissions in the sayeret: looking for information, intelligence and above all\nexperience and insight from whoever I thought was likely to make that always-\nnarrow difference between failure and success. My first calls went to Mookie\nBetzer and another of my most trusted and experienced sayeret comrades,\nAmiram Levin. Then I brought in Ido Ambar, the personal aide to air force\ncommander Benny Peled, and Gadi Shefi, the commander of the Shayetet 13\nSEALs. Finally, two officers from Dan Shomron’s office. Since Dan was\nkatzhar, in overall command of paratroop and infantry forces, it was critical to\nkeep him in the picture. I told them all that we’d be working through the night,\nand that I had to be able to tell Motta and Shimon by the morning whether we\nreally could mount a rescue mission.\n\nI still thought Pd end up having to tell them no. However difficult the\nobstacles we’d faced with Sabena, they were almost child’s play compared to\ngetting a sayeret assault team 5,000 miles across the continent of Africa,\nsurprising the terrorists, freeing the hostages unharmed and getting them out.\nThat was even assuming, as I did at that point, that we wouldn’t face armed\nopposition from the troops of Uganda’s increasingly tyrannical president, Idi\nAmin. Amin had begun to align himself politically with the Palestinians in the\npast few years — one reason, no doubt, the terrorists had landed there. But he\nhad actually been on a paratroop course in Israel before taking power in 1971.\nWe had sent officers to help train his army in the early 1970s.\n\nNow, I discovered, Mookie himself had been on one of the training missions.\n“Their men aren’t great fighters, at least at night,” he said, an insight of obvious\nrelevance to planning a commando attack, if we could get that far. When\nAmbar, the air force aide, spoke up, I finally began to feel we might at least be\nable to put together the outline of a plan. He’d brought with him a copy of the\nstandard reference book on world airports, which gave us at least a general idea\nof the layout of Entebbe. He also said that the air force had run a training\nprogram for the Ugandans. In Entebbe. He’d contacted one of the reserve pilots\nwho had been on the training mission, and he was on his way to join us.\n\nStill, time was short we were nowhere near being able to recommend a\nspecific plan of action.

My skills are not\nin investment strategy, and, as everyone who knows Jeffrey knows, his are not in fashion and\ndesign. We frequently discuss world trends as each of us sees them.”\n\nBy the time Epstein met Wexner, the latter was a retail legend who had built a $3 billion\nempire—one that now includes Victoria’s Secret, Express, and Bath & Body Works—from\n$5,000 lent him by his aunt. “Wexner saw in Jeffrey the type of person who had the potential to\nrealize his [Jeffrey’s] dreams,” says someone who has worked closely with both men. “He gave\nJeffrey the ball, and Jeffrey hit it out of the park.”\n\nWexner, through a trust, bought the town house in which Epstein now lives for a reported $13.2\nmillion in 1989. In 1993, Wexner married Abigail Koppel, a 31-year-old lawyer, and the\nnewlyweds relocated to Ohio; in 1996, Epstein moved into the town house. Public documents\nsuggest that the house is still owned by the trust that bought it, but Epstein has said that he now\nowns the house.\n\nWexner trusts Epstein so completely that he has assigned him the power of fiduciary over all of\nhis private trusts and foundations, says a source close to Wexner. In 1992, Epstein even\npersuaded Wexner to put him on the board of the Wexner Foundation in place of Wexner’s ailing\nmother. Bella Wexner recovered and demanded to be reinstated. Epstein has said they settled by\nsplitting the foundation in two.\n\nEpstein does not care that he comes between family members. In fact, he sees it as his job. He\ntells people, “I am there to represent my client, and if my client needs protecting—sometimes\neven from his own family—then it’s often better that people hate me, not the client.”\n\n“You’ve probably heard I’m vicious in my representation of my clients,” he tells people proudly;\nLeah Kleman describes his haggling over art prices as something like a scene out of the movie\nMad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. Even a former mentor says he’s seen “the dark side” of\nEpstein, and a Bear Stearns source recalls a meeting in which Epstein chewed out a team making\na presentation for Wexner as being so brutal as to be “irresponsible.”\n\nOne reporter, in fact, received three threats from Epstein while preparing a piece. They were\ndelivered in a jocular tone, but the message was clear: There will be trouble for your family if I\ndon’t like the article.\n\nOn the other hand, Epstein is clearly very generous with friends. Joe Pagano, an Aspen-based\nventure capitalist, who has known Epstein since before his Bear Stearns days, can’t say enough\nnice things: “I have a boy who’s dyslexic, and Jeffrey’s gotten close to him over the years....\nJeffrey got him into music. He bought him his first piano. And then as he got to school he had\ndifficulty ... in studying ... so Jeffrey got him interested in taking flying lessons.”\n\nRosa Monckton recalls Epstein telling her that her daughter, Domenica, who suffers from Down\n\nsyndrome, needed the sun, and that Rosa should feel free to bring her to his house in Palm Beach\nanytime.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018004\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He has been to our\nhome for dinner and we have been at his. Over the years, he has sought my advice on legal and\ngovernmental matters, but not on Israeli domestic politics, which he knows I stay out of.\n\nShortly after he first became Prime Minister, he invited me to his office on a Friday afternoon.\n\nMy wife, our daughter and I stood outside of the King David Hotel trying to hail a cab, but all the\ncab drivers were heading home for the weekend. It looked like we might be late for our\nappointment with the Prime Minister. Suddenly a car pulled up. It was the mayor of Jerusalem,\nEhud Olmert, whom I knew. He rolled down his window and shouted, “Alan, you’ll never get a\ncab on a Friday afternoon. Where do you need to go?” I told him and he willingly agreed to\ndrive us there. As I began to get into his car, a cab driver pulled over and said, “I'll take them.”\nOlmert replied, “No, no, it’Il be my pleasure.” The cab driver pulled his car in front of Olmert’s,\nblocking it and shouting, “I don’t try to run Jerusalem, why are you trying to be a cab driver?\nStop taking business from me.” Only in Jerusalem! I paid the cab driver what his fare would’ve\nbeen and took the ride with the mayor.\n\nWhen I got to the Prime Minister’s office, Bibi spent a few minutes with us and then invited me to\nhis private office for a confidential meeting. He explained that this was one of the most secure\nlocations in the world and that anything I told him would never leave the room. He then said,\n“There’s been something I have been waiting to ask you.” I expected him to ask my advice on\nsome critical security or political issue, as he had in the past. I said, “Sure, ask me anything.” He\nput his arm around me and whispered in my ear, “So, did O.J. do it?” I was taken aback but I\nquickly responded, “So, Mr. Prime Minister, does Israel have nuclear weapons?” Bibi looked at\nme sternly and said, “You know I can’t answer that question.” I looked back at him and said,\n“Aha!” Bibi understood and we both laughed.\n\nOver the years I have advised Netanyahu on a variety of issues during his tenure as Prime Minister\nand between his terms. I do not share all of his political and diplomatic views, and he knows that,\nbut he seems to value my judgment, as do several other Israeli political leaders to the left of him.\nThey know I care deeply about Israel and will always give them my unbiased views.\n\nRecently, Netanyahu made the following statement during a nationally-televised conference in\nIsrael:\n\n“First off, I would like to congratulate the Globes Conference for its foresight in inviting\nAlan Dershowitz and I would like to say to Alan. Israel has no greater champion and the\ntruth has no greater defender than Alan Dershowitz.”\n\nI was obviously flattered by his comment. Several hours later, I received a call from President\n\nObama, who had apparently learned of Netanyahu’s words. He said he valued my views because\n“you've always been straight with me over the years that we’ve known each other.” He asked me\n\n364\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017451\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Because of the sector’s high earnings visibility, however, we do not have to wait until a\nparticular structural change occurs for a thesis to play out. Utilities often have earnings visibility 2-3\nyears out (including Street estimates) which is in contrast to other sectors (e.g. tech) which often\ntimes do not have 2-3 quarters of visibility. As such, utility stock prices (and the Street’s estimates)\nwill begin to discount even some of the longer dated structural changes as clarity surfaces in the early\nstages. Therefore, there is a distinct competitive advantage for those who have an early\nunderstanding of such structural changes and the resulting earnings impact on affected utilities. We\ntherefore focus our efforts on discerning the structural change opportunity early in an effort to come\nup with a view before it becomes obvious to the broader market.\n\nMoreover, there are often several opportunities over an extended time period to trade the same\nstructural change as numerous stakeholders (e.g. government, regulator, company, customers, et al.)\ninvolved in the process distort market perceptions of the final outcome.\n\nAlthough structural changes are the “home run” opportunities, Electron returns are not limited to\nsuch changes, as we also consistently play for “singles and doubles” in the global utility sector with\nearning releases, regulatory reviews, dividend increases and decreases, relative value, regulatory\narbitrage, etc.\n\nAs evidence of Electron’s ability to successfully trade both shorter- and longer-term structural\nchanges, please note our sweet spot for generating returns over the 7-year track record has tended\nto be 45-90 days.\n\ne Portfolio Construction\n\nTypically, the portfolio has 70-100 positions, but concentration is very important to generating returns.\nHistorically, the top 10 longs represent 40-50% of the Fund’s value, and top 10 shorts represent 30-40% of\nthe fund’s value. Typically we will have a 10% position in the portfolio; this is invariably a liquid, big-cap\nutility name with limited downside and a good degree of upside which is expected to be favorably\naffected by a key, underappreciated structural change.\n\nThe stronger the conviction (from a risk/reward point of view) in the alpha opportunity, the higher the\ngross we run. This flexibility in portfolio construction (which we successfully proved over 3 years during\nthe first iteration of Electron) provides a distinct advantage given the utility sector’s many low-beta, low-\nvolatility stocks. During the original Electron Capital period, gross ranged from 150% to 215% and a\nmedian of 185% over the period. We see maintaining a similar operating range for gross for the re-launch\nfor Electron.\n\nRegarding nets, we will always have a properly hedged product as there are always opportunities on the\nshort side to generate alpha. Over our 7-year track record period, the net averaged 22% net long. During\n\nthe first 3 years of Electron, our net averaged 30% long. Given our bearish view on utilities over the last 4\nyears, the net averaged 17% net long.\n\ne Risk Model and Risk Management\n\nWe view utilities as distinct bundles of risk. Just as we are staunch supporters of sum-of-the-parts (SOTP)\nvaluation, we are also believers in SOTP risk monitoring.

An n-gram is sequence of\n1-grams, such as the phrases “stock market” (a 2-gram) and\n“the United States of America” (a 5-gram). We restricted n to\n5, and limited our study to n-grams occurring at least 40 times\nin the corpus.\n\nUsage frequency is computed by dividing the number of\ninstances of the n-gram in a given year by the total number of\nwords in the corpus in that year. For instance, in 1861, the 1-\ngram “slavery” appeared in the corpus 21,460 times, on\n11,687 pages of 1,208 books. The corpus contains\n386,434,758 words from 1861; thus the frequency is 5.5x10°.\n“slavery” peaked during the civil war (early 1860s) and then\nagain during the civil rights movement (1955-1968) (Fig. 1B)\n\nIn contrast, we compare the frequency of “the Great War”\nto the frequencies of “World War I” and “World War II.” “the\nGreat War” peaks between 1915 and 1941. But although its\nfrequency drops thereafter, interest in the underlying events\nhad not disappeared; instead, they are referred to as “World\nWar I” (Fig. 1C).\n\nThese examples highlight two central factors that\ncontribute to culturomic trends. Cultural change guides the\nconcepts we discuss (such as “slavery”). Linguistic change —\nwhich, of course, has cultural roots — affects the words we use\nfor those concepts (“the Great War” vs. “World War I’). In\nthis paper, we will examine both linguistic changes, such as\nchanges in the lexicon and grammar; and cultural phenomena,\nsuch as how we remember people and events.\n\nThe full dataset, which comprises over two billion\nculturomic trajectories, is available for download or\nexploration at www.culturomics.org.\n\nThe Size of the English Lexicon\nHow many words are in the English language (9)?\n\nWe call a 1-gram “common” if its frequency is greater\nthan one per billion. (This corresponds to the frequency of the\nwords listed in leading dictionaries (7).) We compiled a list of\nall common 1-grams m 1900, 1950, and 2000 based on the\nfrequency of each 1-gram in the preceding decade. These lists\ncontained 1,117,997 common 1-grams in 1900, 1,102,920 in\n1950, and 1,489,337 in 2000.\n\nNot all common 1-grams are English words. Many fell\ninto three non-word categories: (i) 1-grams with non-\nalphabetic characters (“‘18r’, “3.14159”; (i) misspellings\n(“becuase, “abberation”); and (411) foreign words\n(“sensitivo”).\n\nTo estimate the number of English words, we manually\nannotated random samples from the lists of common 1-grams\n(7) and determined what fraction were members of the above\nnon-word categories. The result ranged from 51% of all\ncommon 1|-grams in 1900 to 31% in 2000.\n\nUsing this technique, we estimated the number of words in\nthe English lexicon as 544,000 in 1900, 597,000 in 1950, and\n1,022,000 in 2000. The lexicon is enjoying a period of\n\nenormous growth: the addition of ~8500 words/year has\nincreased the size of the language by over 70% during the last\nfifty years (Fig. 2A).\n\nNotably, we found more words than appear in any\ndictionary. For instance, the 2002 Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary [W3], which keeps track of the\ncontemporary American lexicon, lists approximately 348,000\nsingle-word wordforms (/0); the American Heritage\nDictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition (AHD4)\nlists 116,161 (7/7). (Both contain additional multi-word\nentries.) Part of this gap is because dictionaries often exclude\nproper nouns and compound words (“whalewatching”). Even\naccounting for these factors, we found many undocumented\nwords, such as “aridification” (the process by which a\ngeographic region becomes dry), “slenthem” (a musical\ninstrument), and, appropriately, the word “deletable.”\n\nThis gap between dictionaries and the lexicon results from\na balance that every dictionary must strike: it must be\ncomprehensive enough to be a useful reference, but concise\nenough to be printed, shipped, and used. As such, many\ninfrequent words are omitted. To gauge how well dictionaries\nreflect the lexicon, we ordered our year 2000 lexicon by\nfrequency, divided it into eight deciles (ranging from 10° —\n10° to 10° — 10°), and sampled each decile (7). We manually\nchecked how many sample words were listed in the OED (12)\nand in the Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary [MWD].\n(We excluded proper nouns, since neither OED nor MWD\nlists them.) Both dictionaries had excellent coverage of high\nfrequency words, but less coverage for frequencies below 10°\n°: 67% of words in the 10° — 10° range were listed in neither\ndictionary (Fig. 2B). Consistent with Zipf’s famous law, a\nlarge fraction of the words in our lexicon (63%) were in this\nlowest frequency bin. As a result, we estimated that 52% of\nthe English lexicon — the majority of the words used in\nEnglish books — consists of lexical “dark matter”\nundocumented in standard references (/2).\n\nTo keep up with the lexicon, dictionaries are updated\nregularly (/3). We examined how well these changes\ncorresponded with changes in actual usage by studying the\n2077 1-gram headwords added to AHD4 in 2000. The overall\nfrequency of these words, such as “buckyball” and\n“netiquette”, has soared since 1950: two-thirds exhibited\nrecent, sharp increases in frequency (>2X from 1950-2000)\n(Fig. 2C). Nevertheless, there was a lag between\nlexicographers and the lexicon. Over half the words added to\nAHD4 were part of the English lexicon a century ago\n(frequency >10° from 1890-1900). In fact, some newly-\nadded words, such as “gypseous” and “amplidyne”, have\nalready undergone a steep decline in frequency (Fig. 2D).\n\nNot only must lexicographers avoid adding words that\nhave fallen out of fashion, they must also weed obsolete\nwords from earlier editions. This is an imperfect process.

The government provides the remaining 17% of services through Head Start and\npublic schools. The government pays for public school and Head Start programs, but also subsidizes\npayments of low-income families to providers of their choice through the Child Care Development Block\nGrant and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which are blended with state dollars. About 25% of\nfor-profit early childhood care revenue comes from these subsidy programs.\n\nThe government is, at both the federal and state level, actively involved in expanding the availability of\nearly childhood care services. Federal support is delivered at the state level through government-\noperated educational and financial assistance programs. Early childhood care services offered directly by\nstates include training, licensing and regulation for early childhood care providers and resource and\nreferral systems for parents seeking ECE.\n\nThe increasing importance of education is further demonstrated by the “No Child Left Behind Act of\n2001,\" signed into law in January 2002. This Act is the most sweeping reform of the Elementary and\nSecondary Education Act, or ESEA, since ESEA was enacted in 1965. To support this commitment,\nPresident Bush requested a $54.4 billion budget for the Department of Education for fiscal 2007, a 28.9%\nincrease from the 2001 budget of $42.2 billion.\n\nCertain tax incentives exist for early childhood care programs. Section 21 of the Internal Revenue Code\nprovides federal Income tax credits ranging from 20% to 35% of certain early childhood care expenses for\nqualified individuals.\n\n8.4, The U.S, K-12 Education Market\n\nA fundamental change has occurred in the K-12 sector in recent years, as the desire to improve school\nquality has overtaken demographics as a key growth driver. Companies providing supplemental\neducational services (e.g., KLC) and several school alternatives, such as charter and contract schools\n(e.g., k12), are expected to be instrumental in improving K-12 student performance.\n\nThe K-12 education market in the U.S. is comprised of over 15,000 school districts including mere than\n90,000 K-12 public schools, approximately 3.5 million teachers, and about 54 million students according\nto the National Center for Education Statistics. Total K-12 expenditures, federal, state and local, are\napproximately $500 billion.\n\nDespite the growth in spending on public education over the last decade, student achievement has shown\nlittie progress. According to the 2005 National Assessment of Educational Progress, 32% of eighth-\ngraders performed below the Basic level in mathematics, and only 29% performed at or above the\nProficient level. One-third of American fourth graders are functionally illiterate. KUE believes the\nfollowing factors will present significant market opportunities in the coming years for for-profit K-12\n\n67\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024500\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Most of this chapter will focus on fairly concrete patterns of this\nnature, such as are involved in inter-agent communication and naive physics; however, it’s also\nworth noting the potential importance of more abstract patterns distinguishing the everyday\nworld from arbitrary mathematical environments.\n\nThe propensity to search for hierarchical patterns is one huge potential example of an ab-\nstract everyday-world property. We strongly suspect the reason that searching for hierarchical\npatterns works so well, in so many everyday-world contexts, lies in the particular structure of\nthe everyday world — it’s not something that would be true across all possible environments\n(even if one weights the space of possible environments in some clever way, say using program-\nlength according to some standard computational model). However, this sort of assertion is of\ncourse highly “philosophical,” and becomes complex to formulate and defend convincingly given\nthe current state of science and mathematics.\n\nGoing one step further, we recall from Chapter 3 a structure called the “dual network”, which\nconsists of superposed hierarchical and heterarchical networks: basically a hierarchy in which\nthe distance between two nodes in the hierarchy is correlated with the distance between the\nnodes in some metric space. Another high level property of the everyday world may be that dual\nnetwork structures are prevalent. This would imply that minds biased to represent the world in\nterms of dual network structure are likely to be intelligent with respect to the everyday world.\n\nIn a different direction, the extreme commonality of symmetry groups in the (everyday and\notherwise) physical world is another example: they occur so often that minds oriented toward\nrecognizing patterns involving symmetry groups are likely to be intelligent with respect to the\nreal world.\n\nWe suspect that the number of cognitively-relevant properties of the everyday world is huge\n... and that the essence of everyday-world intelligence lies in the list of varyingly abstract and\nconcrete properties, which must be embedded implicitly or explicitly in the structure of a natural\nor artificial intelligence for that system to have everyday-world intelligence.\n\nApart from these particular yet abstract properties of the everyday world, intelligence is just\nabout “finding patterns in which actions tend to achieve which goals in which situations” ... but,\nthe simple meta-algorithm needed to accomplish this universally is, we suggest, only a small\npercentage what it takes to make a mind.\n\nYou might say that a sufficiently generally intelligent system should be able to infer the\nvarious cognitively-relevant properties of the environment from looking at data about the ev-\neryday world. We agree in principle, and in fact Ben Kuipers and his colleagues have done\nsome interesting work in this direction, showing that learning algorithms can infer some basics\nabout the structure of space and time from experience [MIX07]. But we suggest that doing this\nreally thoroughly would require a massively greater amount of processing power than an AGI\nthat embodies and hence automatically utilizes these principles. It may be that the problem of\ninferring these properties is so hard as to require a wildly infeasible ATXI“ / Godel Machine\ntype system.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013078\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Lents and Robert Trivers\n\nThere is no shortage of published psychological profiles of Donald J. Trump that\nattempt to diagnose him, from a distance, as either a psychopath or a narcissistic\nsociopath. These profiles, of course, are fatally hindered by the lack of access to Mr.\nTrump for personal examination and completion of personality inventories.\nHowever, exploration of the evolutionary features of these very peculiar personality\ntypes may provide insight into this important question.\n\nPsychopaths are indeed an evolutionary conundrum because their particular\nbehaviors are not an obvious path toward evolutionary success. For example, the\nmajority of serial killers are childless when they are killed or apprehended.\nNarcissistic sociopaths, however, invariably [typically] have families and children\nwhom they support energetically, and many of the traits specific to this phenotype\ncan fairly be called adaptive. This raises the important issue of the evolutionary\nniche of a narcissistic sociopath within the societies in which they exist.\n\nThe psychological profile of narcissistic sociopathy is generally agreed upon and\nshares many features with psychopaths including above average intelligence,\nconsiderable social savvy, adaptability, likeability, and natural skills in the\nmanipulation of others. They are charming, outgoing, and often feign interest in\npeople and subjects and can convincingly fake both sympathy and conscience. If\nthey engage in charitable acts at all, they are only in pursuit of ancillary selfish\nbenefits. They learn well from past experiences, and show no dedication to a set of\nmoral values, religious beliefs, truth, transparency. If they admire anyone, it is other\nsociopaths that they wish to emulate. Finally, they are effective liars and show a\nchilling unconcern for the welfare of others.\n\nThere is one particular skill that is common to both psychopaths and narcissistic\nsociopaths and absolutely essential to their nature: cognitive empathy. Emotional\nempathy, sometimes called emotional contagion, is regarded as the ability and\ntendency to closely identify with the emotional experience of others, even “catching”\ntheir emotions to a degree. Cognitive empathy is quite different. This is a mental skill\ninvolving the close observation and interpretation of the actions and emotions of\nothers in order to understand and predict their behavior. It is morally neutral and\ncommon in high-functioning individuals across the moral and ethical spectrum.\nWhile social workers and therapists use cognitive empathy to help individuals\nimprove their lives, psychopaths and sociopaths use this skill to manipulate, coerce,\nand deceive others in order to achieve their own ends. While emotional empathy is\nan innate cognitive feature we share with most social mammals, cognitive empathy\nis a skill that can be developed and refined and doing so is key to the behavioral\npatterns of both psychopaths and sociopaths.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033323\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

On the turret\nof our tank, Yishai and I were firing back, our Uzis on automatic, and throwing\ngrenades. I could hear bullets pinging off the turret and the body of the tank.\nThen, from our far right flank, came the shoulder-mounted Saggers, honing in\nwith their eerie blue-red glow, juddering towards us as the Egyptian soldiers\ncorrected their trajectories. One of the missiles barely missed us, and the silky\nwire from its guidance mechanism was tangled over our turret. I tried using my\nbinoculars to identify where they were coming from, but it was no use.\n\nTo my right, I could see that the APCs had completed their first evacuation\nrun and were coming back for more of Yitzhik’s men. There was a raggedness\nabout it all: one APC, then a couple of others, then a gap, then another one or\ntwo. They were doing whatever they could, whenever they could, as the\nEgyptian fire continued to intensify. A few of Yitzhik’s men, whether desperate\nor dazed, simply stood up and starting walking west, toward the canal, only to\nbe cut down by Egyptian gunfire.\n\nI directed Moshe Sukenik to take half the company and head toward the\nSaggers to try to take them out, even though we both knew that he’d have to\nrisk heavy fire before they got close enough. He had two-inch mortars on his\nturret, but their range was only 500 yards, far less than the Saggers. Every 45\nseconds or so, a salvo of Saggers zeroed in on our tanks and APCs. Within a\ncouple of minutes, two of the tanks were hit. One was on fire. The SU-100 tank-\ndestroyers were still there as well. Egyptian infantrymen were spraying us with\nsmall arms fire. The whole area was swathed in grayish smoke. Every minute or\ntwo, another tank or APC took a direct hit. There was a smell, too, which, once\nexperienced, never leaves your memory: the scent of burnt human flesh.\n\nThe fire from the foxholes was getting worse. “Run over them,” I ordered\nmy tank driver. “Start with the foxhole in front of us.” He jerked us forward and\nwe plowed over the first Egyptian position. “Reverse, get the one to the right,” I\nsaid. As he backed up, I was shocked to see a surviving Egyptian soldier,\nshrugging off a thick blanket of sand from his shoulders, raise an RPG launcher\nat us from just 15 feet away. We were close enough to look into each other’s\neyes. I raised my Uzi and shot him before he could fire. Rifle and grenade fire\ncontinued from along the line of foxholes. A second length of the Saggers’ silk-\nlike guidance wire tangled over our main gun. Yishai was firing at the\nEgyptians from the other side of the tank. We both tossed grenades in the\ndirection of the worst of the gunfire.\n\n153\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028001\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Just as unfunded corporate pensions and other post-employment benefits\n(OPEB) weigh on public corporations, unfunded entitlements, over time, may increase USA\nInc.’s cost of capital.

The good news: USA Inc.’s underlying asset base and\nentrepreneurial culture are strong. The financial trends can shift toward a positive direction,\nbut both ‘management’ and ‘shareholders’ will need collective focus, willpower, commitment,\nand sacrifice.\n\nNote: USA federal fiscal year ends in September, Cash flow = total revenue — total spending on a cash basis; net worth includes\nunfunded future liabilities from Social Security and Medicare on an accrual basis over the next 75 years.

These suffered the obvious disadvantage of not working\nat night, but it was also unsatisfactory to use the motion of the sun to\npredict the motion of the sun. The earliest ‘heaven independent’ clocks\nused water flowing through small holes in pottery vessels. They were\neffective over short intervals but plagued by dust, dirt and evaporation.\nIt was the invention of the anchor escapement that enabled the first\naccurate mechanical clocks.\n\nBy the sixteenth century clockmakers had gone to town developing\nastrological clocks with more and more gears, to show all manner of\ninformation; the phases of the moon, the motions of planets, even the\nmotion of moons orbiting those planets. These clocks became hugely\nornate. The astrological clock at Hampton Court Palace was built for\nHenry VII circa 1542 and, as well as showing phases of the moon\nand the signs of the zodiac, it accurately calculated the time of high\ntide at London Bridge, allowing Henry to travel quickly to the Tower\nof London. You might also notice it shows the sun orbiting the earth!\nCopernicus published his book, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On\nthe Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres) showing the earth orbited the sun\na year later in 1543, and it took centuries before it became accepted fact.\n\nClocks need gears. The humble gear is a simple machine. They\nwork because wheels of different size have different circumferences — the\ndistance around the edge - but one full turn is the same for all wheels.\nImagine you have a circular sweet such as a Life Saver — or Polo for\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015732\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But\nRichard Allen says he recalls talking to Epstein at Hoffenberg’s direction and telling him it was\nurgent they retrieve the missing bonds for a state examination. According to Allen, Epstein said,\n“We'll get them back.” He had “kind of a flippant attitude,” says Allen. “They never came\nback.”\n\nEpstein, according to Hoffenberg, also came up with a scheme to manipulate the price of Emery\nFreight stock in an attempt to minimize the losses that occurred when Hoffenberg’s bid went\nwrong and the share price began to fall. This was alleged to have involved multiple clients’\naccounts controlled by Epstein.\n\nEventually, in 1991, insurance regulators in Illinois sued Hoffenberg. He settled the case, and\nEpstein, who was only a paid consultant, was never deposed or accused of any wrongdoing.\nBarry Gross, the attorney who was handling the suit for the regulators, says of Epstein, “He was\nvery elusive.... It was hard to really track him down. There were a substantial number of checks\nfor significant dollars that were paid to him, I remember.... He was this character we never got a\nhandle on. Again we presumed that he was involved with the Pan Am and Emery run that\nHoffenberg made, but we never got a chance to depose him.”\n\n“From the government’s discovery in the main sentencing against Hoffenberg it would seem the\ngovernment was perhaps a bit lazy,” says David Lewis, who represented Mitchell Brater. “They\nwent for what they knew they could get ... and that was the fraudulent promissory notes [i.e., the\nmuch larger and unrelated part of Hoffenberg’s fraud, based in New York State].... What they\ncouldn’t get, they didn’t bother with.”\n\nAnother lawyer involved in the criminal prosecution of Hoffenberg says, “In a criminal\ninvestigation like that, when there is a guilty plea, to be quick and dirty about it, discovery is\nalways incomplete.... They don’t have to line up witnesses; they don’t have to learn every fact\nthat might come out on cross-examination.”\n\nEpstein was involved with Hoffenberg in other questionable transactions. Financial records show\nthat in 1988 Epstein invested $1.6 million in Riddell Sports Inc., a company that manufactures\nfootball helmets. Among his co-investors were the theater mogul Robert Nederlander and\nattorney Leonard Toboroff. A source close to this transaction claims that Epstein told\nNederlander and Toboroff that he had raised his share of the money from a Swiss banker, whose\nidentity they could not be allowed to know. But Hoffenberg has claimed the money came from\nhim, and Towers’s financial statements for that year show a loan to Epstein of $400,000.\n(Epstein has said he can’t remember the details and has disputed the accuracy of the Towers\nfinancial reports.)\n\nAround the same time, Nederlander and Toboroff let Epstein come in with them on a scheme to\nmake money out of Pennwalt, a Pennsylvania chemical company. The plan was to group together\nwith two other parties to take a substantial declared position in the stock. According to a source,\nEpstein was supposed to help Nederlander and Toboroff raise $15 million. He seemed to fail to\nfind other investors, say those familiar with the deal. (Epstein has said he was merely an\ninvestor.) He invested $1 million, which he told his co-investors was his own money.

Yet, the prosecutor did everything in his power to keep the truth from coming\nout. He arranged for the Washington family to take the courtroom pass away from their lawyer,\nso that he could not attend the trial and feel ethically compelled to stand up and correct the\nWashingtons' testimony when they falsely denied any contingency fee or written agreement with\nhim. (The prosecutor also had an ethical obligation to correct the false testimony given by his\nwitness. Indeed he had an even greater obligation because he was the one who put on the\ntestimony that he knew was false.)\n\nThe ploy worked—at least for a while. But the Rhode Island lawyer soon learned that his clients\nwere not being straight with the jury. He began to worry that he might have an ethical obligation\nto blow the whistle on his clients, as lawyers do when their clients or witnesses are committing\nperjury. So the lawyer went to the Rhode Island Disciplinary Counsel—the attorney in charge of\nenforcing the ethical rules that govern lawyers—to obtain guidance. She referred the matter to\nthe Rhode Island Supreme Court which issued an unprecedented opinion concluding that “the\nattorney had an obligation to disclose the existence of his contingent fee agreement to the\n[Indiana] criminal trial court.” The state’s highest court found that the agreement’s “existence\nmight well have had a bearing upon the jury’s determination.” The Rhode Island court then\ndirected the attorney to disclose to the Indiana court the information that the Washingtons had\nwithheld. He did so but the Indiana courts ignored this new information, despite the conclusion\nof the Rhode Island Supreme Court that it might well have affected the jury’s verdict. Indeed,\nwhat could be more important than the fact—unbeknownst to the jury—that Desiree Washington\nhad millions of dollars riding on whether Mike Tyson was convicted or acquitted, since without a\nconviction, it would have been difficult for her to collect monetary damages or sell her story to\nthe media. The only thing that might have been more important is that she had been untruthful\nabout her financial motive for accusing Tyson of rape.\n\nIt also turns out that Desiree was hardly the naive virgin she pretended to be. Once her name was\ndisclosed following the trial, numerous witnesses confirmed that Desiree Washington was a\nsexually active young woman who hung out in nightclubs. Indeed, her lawyer implied to the media\nthat Washington had been examined for venereal disease a month before she had sex with Tyson\nand that she was \"not sexually active\" during that brief period.\n\nNot only was the jury misinformed about Desiree Washington's general sexual proclivities, they\nwere also denied the most crucial eyewitness testimony of what she was doing just minutes before\nshe went to Tyson's hotel room. She denied necking with Tyson in the limo on the way to the\nhotel. Indeed, she testified that she rebuffed his attempt to kiss her and \"jumped back.\" Tyson's\ntestimony was precisely the opposite. He swore that when he kissed her, \"she kissed me,\" and that\non the drive to his hotel, he and Washington were \"kissing, touching.\" The jury obviously believed\nDesiree's testimony because Tyson's was uncorroborated and self-serving.\n\nBut it turns out that there were three eyewitnesses -- disinterested outsiders who happened to be\nin front of the hotel when the limo pulled up -- who saw what was going on inside and outside the\nlimo just before Tyson and Washington left it to go to his hotel room. They saw them necking --\n\"they were all over each other\" -- and holding hands on the way to the hotel (Desiree denied both\nnecking and holding hands).\n\n236\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017323\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In those nine\nyears, he rose, or was maneuvered by the KGB, into a top position\nin the CIA’s highly sensitive Counterintelligence Center Analysis\nGroup, which allowed him to deliver hundreds of top secrets to the\nKGB. In return, according to Cherkashin, Ames received between\n$20,000 and $50,000 in cash for each delivery, which amounted to\n$4.6 million over the nine years.\n\nTasked Cherkashin about the weakness the KGB looked for in an\nAmerican intelligence worker that might lead him to copy and steal\ntop secret documents.

Clearly, many\nvictims can and do suffer secondary victimization during criminal\ninvestigations, such as when sexual assault victims are treated\ninappropriately by law enforcement agents.'°’ It would contradict the\npurpose of preventing victim mistreatment in the criminal justice system to\nartificially limit the right to fairness to the point at which charges are filed.\nThe night to fairness logically applies at all stages of the criminal justice\nprocess.\n\nC. OLC’S INEFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO THE CVRA’S COVERAGE AND\nVENUE PROVISIONS\n\nAt the end of its memorandum, OLC finally discusses what it\nidentifies as the two strongest arguments for construing the CVRA as\napplying before charging: the coverage provision and the venue provision.\nOLC acknowledges, as it must, that the CVRA’s coverage extends to any\nfederal employee engaged in “the defection, investigation or prosecution of\ncrime.”'*’ Such employees “shall make their best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified of, and accorded, the rights” afforded by the statute.'°’\nNotably, this duty applies to individuals not just in the Justice Department\n(where all federal prosecutors are located) but other agencies as well, such\n\n155 150 Cona.

While he’d never lost the formal bearing — or the\naccent — from his childhood in Poland, his long years in Israel’s political\nwilderness mirrored the wider exclusion felt by the Sephardim. The last election\nhe had lost, in December 1973, proved too soon for the earth to part. But he told\nhis supporters: “Even though Labour has won these elections, after something\nlike the Yom Kippur War happens to a country, and to a government, they must\nlose power. They wi// lose power.” He was right. Only twice in the four decades\nthat followed would a Labor leader defeat Begin’s Likud party: Rabin’s election\nvictory in 1992, and mine over Bibi Netanyahu in 1999.\n\nDuring the first two years of Begin’s rule, however, I was 7,000 miles away.\nTen days before the election, I’d gone to see Motta, and he’d agreed that I could\nreturn to Stanford, to finish what I’d barely begun when the 1973 war broke out.\nI had been in the army, with the one hiatus as a sayeret reservist at Hebrew\nUniversity, since the age of seventeen. I did not regret committing myself to a\nlife in uniform. But Stanford offered an extraordinary opportunity to broaden\nmy horizons. Even in the few weeks I’d spent there before the war, I'd felt\nreinvigorated. It engaged a different kind of intelligence, a different part of who\nI was: the books, the professors. A chance to listen to, and at least try to play,\nbeautiful music. And to spend more than a few stolen evenings or weekends\nwith my family.\n\nThe timing had nothing to do with the election. Like most other Labor\nIsraelis, and many of Begin’s own supporters, I hadn’t expected the Likud to\nwin. It was because I felt I'd reached a natural punctuation mark in my military\ncareer. I’d led Sayeret Matkal. I’d commanded a tank company, a battalion in\n1973, and, more briefly than I’d hoped, the 401° Brigade after the war. I’d spent\nthe last two years in the kirva. The next step up the command chain would be to\nlead a full armored division. But at age 35, I was probably too young, and I\nfigured I’d have a far better chance in two years’ time. I also feared losing the\nchance to go to Stanford altogether. Motta’s term as chief of staff would end the\nfollowing year. Among those in the frame to succeed him was Raful Eitan.\nRecalling Raful’s dismissive, almost sneering, opposition to my making the\nSayeret Matkal into Israel’s SAS, I wasn’t exactly confident I could count on\nhis support.\n\n181\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028029\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

An important study of simultaneous time series from 16 subdural\nelectrodes placed in the right temporal cortex of a patient with a right medial\ntemporal lobe epileptogenic focus demonstrated that a decrease in a single lead’s\nA(+) reliably anteceded and localized the first signs of the incipient seizure. The\nrest of the leads followed with similarly decreased positivity in their leading\nLyapounov exponents associated with spatially coherent patterns of behavior. In\naddition, the averaged value of the leading Lyapounov exponents in the 16 leads\nincreased post-ictally over the averaged values of 4(+)in the pre-ictal state\n(lasemidis et al, 1988,1990). These findings, including seizure anticipation for 25\nminutes, were confirmed using intracranial recordings in 16 patients with temporal\n\nlobe epilepsy (Elger and Lehnertz, 1998). The para-ictal decrease and post-ictal\nincrease in 4(+) found in patients with focal temporal lobe seizures was confirmed\n\nmore generally in left and right pre-frontal-to-mastoid EEG recordings made before,\nduring and after electroconvulsive shock treatment of psychiatric patients (Krystal\nand Weiner, 1991). Pre-ictal changes were also found six minutes before seizure\nonset from scalp EEG recordings in 17/19 patients with chronic focal epilepsy\n(Martinerie et al, 1998). The most exciting potential application of this approach is\nits use, in real time, for the prediction and prophylactic treatment of incipient\nseizures, minutes to hours before the event, in place of or augmenting long term\n\ndrug management (lasemidis and Sackellares, 1996).\n\nThere is a growing literature about leading Lyapounov exponent(s) in the\nreconstructed attractor of the EEG associated with a variety of normal and\n\npathological human behavioral states.

Right after this\nimportant event, the Chinese government should take advan-\ntage of the major shifts in the Americas, look across the Pacific\nand launch a parallel effort: the “Belt and Sea Lane” initiative\nfor China and Latin America (Mexico, the Caribbean, and Cen-\ntral and South America).\n\nThree recent seismic changes have dramatically affected Latin\nAmerica. First, the economic links that China has developed\nover the past 13 years with South America. Second, the end of\npopulism in this region. Third, the election of Donald Trump as\npresident of the United States, which will severely damage eco-\nnomic integration in the Americas, as shown by the recent\ndemise of the US-led Trans-Pacific-Partnership agreement. Let\nus broadly review these three waves to understand the opportu-\nnity for China.\n\nSouth America swayed from the “lost half decade” of 1998-\n2003, to the “golden decade” of 2004-14, and this change hap-\npened mainly because of China. South American nations are\nrich in minerals, energy and food, which China started buying at\ngrowing prices and in ever increasing volumes. China is the\nmain purchaser and price driver for commodities; whether it is\ncopper from Chile, soybeans from Argentina or Paraguay, iron\nore and grains from Brazil, gold from Peru, beef from Uruguay,\ntin from Bolivia, oil from Venezuela and Ecuador, or coal from\nColombia.\n\nThis economic link became crystal clear in the US financial\ncrisis of 2008 that slowed down the economies of Mexico, Cen-\ntral America and the Caribbean (CAC), which all depend heavily\non exports to the US market and remittances from there, but\nSouth America kept growing so long as China kept growing. The\ndividing line became clear: in Latin America, south of the Pana-\nma Canal the economic driver is China, north of the Panama\nCanal it still is the US.\n\nChina has become the main buyer of South American com-\nmodities, a more important lender and an active investor. The\nchallenge remains to have China become a full blown, long-term\ndevelopment partner for South America.\n\nThe Chinese influence in Mexico-CAC is different. Here China\nis viewed as a competitor for access to the US market with man-\nufactured goods (Mexico) and textiles (CAC), as well a price hik-\ner for food products, and fuel that CAC needs to import. So the\nChinese economic influence is dominant in South America. The\nUS has been the prevailing influence in Mexico and CAC, until\nTrump was elected. The future for Mexico and CAC is now\nuncertain.\n\nWith sky-high commodity prices, South America was gov-\nerned according to the Hugo Chavez project in Venezuela, the\nWorkers Party (PT) in Brazil, the Kirchner power couple in\nArgentina, and other like-minded projects in the region. South\nAmerican coffers were filled by Chinese purchases of oil, grains\nand minerals, as populist regimes reigned over South America.\nThere was a tendency to nationalize companies, spend freely, set\nlow unsustainable consumer prices, close off free trade and not\nbe very friendly to foreign investment in general.\n\nWith the commodity price decline since 2014 (especially oil\nprices) and voters fed up with and tired of corruption and abus-\nes of populist regimes, the tide turned. More countries now have\nmarket-friendly governments. The end of populism in South\nAmerica bodes well for China, as the current governments are\nmore open to Chinese investment, more open to trade and can\nassure a better structural framework to collaborate with China.\n\nFor the first time in its history, the US has elected a president\nwho combines a protectionist trade position with an anti-migra-\ntion policy. Trump has particularly targeted Mexico, promising\nto deport 11 million people, to build a wall by seizing remittan-\nces sent from the US, to hike duties for manufactured goods and\nabrogate the North American Free Trade Agreement. This is\nvery worrisome for Mexico, but it also affects many countries in\nLatin America that have citizens sending remittances from the\nUS. The trade disruption will eventually affect all CAC countries,\nas well as Chile, Colombia and Peru, that all have similar free\ntrade treaties with the US.\n\nSouth America swayed to the “golden\n\ndecade” of 2004-14, and this change\nhappened mainly because of China.\n\nTaking into account the economic interdependence between\nChina and South America, the end of populism in South Ameri-\nca, and the dramatic threats that the Trump administration pos-\nes to Mexico and CAC, it is clear that time, circumstances and\nevents are providing a significant opening for China to propose\na full-blown partnership with Latin America.\n\nThe proposal should seize the opportunity of the “demise” of\nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. Mexico now needs reli-\nable partners, unlike the US; so will CAC very soon; and South\nAmerica needs to deepen its strong trade ties with China.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping can take advantage of his strengthened\nposition as the core leader of China, his commitment to address\nclimate change and his stance as the world’s free trade leader,\nwhich will help China to extend its Belt and Road Initiative\ntoward Latin America, across the Pacific, with a “Belt and Sea\nLane” proposal. The basic elements of it should be trade, loans,\ninvestment and respect for human dignity (No deportations. No\ndiscrimination). A new trade framework, the active presence of\nthe China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in Latin\nAmerica and the expansion of Confucian Institutes should be\npart of this initiative. Latin America is ready and ripe for such a\nproposal.\n\nThis is the right time to show that while some want to build\nwalls to divide and separate, China wants to build a bridge\nacross the Pacific to integrate and link Asia and Latin America.\n\nJust one opportunity illustrates the potential of a deeper Chi-\nna-Latin America partnership. China is the world’s leading\nmanufacturer of lithium batteries, close to 90 percent of the\nworld’s lithium reserves are in South America. Our new, deeper\npartnership can easily prevail in the race to lead the new wave of\nlithium batteries for cleaner, more efficient development in the\n21st century.\n\nThe window of opportunity is now the Belt and Sea Lane Ini-\ntiative for a stronger China-Latin America partnership.\n\nThe author is former president of Bolivia.\n\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn\n\nX1s philosophy for engaging with\nthe world embodied in initiative\n\nhe Belt and Road Forum for\nInternational Cooperation\nwill be held on Sunday and\nMonday. How does the initi-\native express President Xi Jinping’s\npolitical philosophy with respect to\nChina’s foreign and domestic policy?\n\nXi’s foreign policy is to engage the\nworld, safeguard China’s core inter-\nests, encourage mutual economic\ndevelopment, and facilitate China’s\nemergence as a great power. Xi’s\ndomestic policy stresses reform, rule\nof law, and the realization of an all-\nround moderately prosperous socie-\nty, which requires the alleviation of\nextreme poverty.\n\nHere’s how the Belt and Road Initi-\native enhances the four pillars of Chi-\nna’s foreign policy.\n\nA multi-polar world has long been\na cornerstone of China’s foreign poli-\ncy, which opposes domination by one\nor two superpowers. The Belt and\nRoad Initiative engages more than 60\ncountries along multiple land and\nmaritime routes and exemplifies a\nmulti-polar world.\n\nPeaceful development is China’s\nwatchword. It has vowed that no mat-\nter how powerful the country\nbecomes, it will never seek domina-\ntion. The Belt and Road projects are\nfounded on mutual cooperation,\nshared development and joint con-\nstruction irrespective of the size or\npower of the host country.\n\nPeople-to-people communications\nare an integral part of the Belt and\nRoad Initiative: multi-channel, multi-\nlevel exchanges between peoples to\n\npromote mutual understanding.\nExamples include sister cities, cultur-\nal activities, non-governmental orga-\nnizations, and public diplomacy.\n\nA “community of shared future” is\nhow Xi epitomizes the dreams of\ndiverse peoples in common pursuit of\npeace and development. In this con-\ntext, the 2,000-year history of\nexchanges along the ancient Silk\nRoad provides precedence that differ-\nent countries, races, religions, beliefs,\npolitical systems and cultural back-\ngrounds can achieve peace and share\nthe fruits of their interactions — pro-\nvided they persist in seeking common\ngoals and mutual trust, equality and\nmutual benefit, and tolerance and\nmutual learning.\n\nThe Belt and Road Initiative will be\nsuccessful to the extent that China’s\nprinciples of domestic development\ncan be adopted and adapted by other\ndeveloping countries according to\ntheir own conditions. Xi’s overarch-\ning principles for guiding China’s\ndomestic transformation are innova-\ntion, coordination, greenness, open-\nness and sharing.\n\nHow does each relate to the Belt\nand Road Initiative?\n\nLarge-scale infrastructure projects\nrequire structural innovation, espe-\ncially in their financing and invest-\nment robustness. (The Belt and Road\nprojects must be financially viable;\nthey are not foreign aid.) The Asian\nInfrastructure Investment Bank, ini-\ntiated by China to facilitate projects,\nis itself a major innovation.\n\nFor each Belt and Road project,\n\nChinas spirit of open-\nness, as well as its pol-\nicy of opening-up\npolicy catalyzed the\n\ncountrys economic\ndevelopment.\n\ndiverse components, such as the local\ngovernment, project management,\ninternational financing, and foreign\nand domestic constructing compa-\nnies must be coordinated so they\nwork together.\n\nAs developing countries are more\nconcerned about economic develop-\nment than environmental protection,\nthe short-sighted move of shipping\noff polluting industries to them\nshould be guarded against. If Belt and\nRoad projects pollute host countries,\nlocal populations will come to resent\nChina. Environmental protection and\ngreen development are essential.\n\nChina’s spirit of openness, as well\nas its opening-up policy catalyzed the\ncountry’s economic development.\nThis same spirit and policy can ener-\ngize countries along the Belt and\nRoad while respecting local cultures\nand conditions. But what worked in\nChina, if transplanted wholesale, will\n\nlikely not work elsewhere. The chal-\nlenge for developing countries is to\nadapt what makes sense for their own\nconditions.\n\nSharing is the essence of the Belt\nand Road Initiative. It is the proper\nspirit for all human beings and it is\nessential for maintaining global sta-\nbility. Inequalities are a primary\ncause of instability. Shared develop-\nment is as much a matter of transfer-\nring experience as it is of transferring\nmoney.\n\nJust as these five major develop-\nment concepts are transforming Chi-\nna’s society and rebalancing China’s\neconomy, the Belt and Road Initiative\ncan transform the developing world’s\ninfrastructure and rebalance the\nentire global economy.\n\nChina cannot aspire to global lead-\nership by means of power alone. Eco-\nnomic and military strength, while\nnecessary, are not sufficient. There\nmust also be a moral or ethical arc to\nChina’s rise, and this includes Belt\nand Road projects. China, as Xi\nasserts, should “balance justice and\nbenefits, stress faithfulness, value\nfriendship, carry forward righteous-\nness, and foster ethics.”\n\nThere will be challenges: unfore-\nseen events that China will have to\nhandle with sensitivity. But can China\ndemonstrate moral as well as eco-\nnomic leadership?\n\nThe author is a public intellectual,\npoliticalconomics commentator,\nand international corporate strate-\ngist.\n\nhere was atime not long ago\n\nwhen most big social and\n\neconomic challenges were\n\ndomestic. With good policies\nand good implementation of those\npolicies, many countries could tackle\nthese problems alone. China’s recent\nsuccess in lifting millions of people\nout of poverty is a perfect example of\nthis.\n\nBut today, our challenges are not\nonly domestic, and they are not only\nsocial and economic.\n\nClimate change, pollution, and the\nloss of biodiversity are environmental\nissues that spill over borders.\n\nAnd today, issues such as poverty,\ninequality, peace and security are\nnot only problems facing individ-\nual countries.\n\nThese are global challenges.\nThey must be tackled collec-\ntively.\n\nA number of countries\nare leading the way in\nfostering international\ncooperation. China,\nwith its Belt and\nRoad Initiative, is\none of them.\n\nEvidence of this\ncan be seen in\nEthiopia, where\nChina has helped\nto build a metro\nsystem in Addis\nAbaba, and in\nKenya, where a\nstandard gauge\nrailway is being\nbuilt to link the\nport of Mombasa\nfirst with Nairobi,\nand ultimately with\nneighboring Ugan-\nda, Rwanda, and\nSouth Sudan. In recent\nyears, Chinese compa-\nnies have aslo led renew-\nable energy projects in\nplaces such as Pakistan,\nThailand and the Philippines.\n\nSuch massive investment in\ndevelopment is on a scale never\nbefore seen. And there is great\nprogress to be made on security, eco-\nnomic and social challenges.\n\nBut we cannot forget the other\nglobal challenge that we must face\ntogether: protecting the environment.\n\nUN Environment also recognizes\nthe potential of the Belt and Road ini-\ntiative to improve people’s lives. We\nalso know how important it is to do\nthis sustainably.\n\nIf we do not make Belt and Road\nprojects climate friendly, we put the\nworld at risk from worsening pollu-\ntion and severe climate change. If\n\nErik Solheim\n\nESTABLISHING\nGREEN ROUTES\nFOR GROWTH\n\nLIMIN / CHINA DAILY\n\ndone right, millions will see the bene-\nfits of green growth.\n\nNow is the time to do it right and\nmake Belt and Road as green as possi-\nble.\n\nThat is why UN Environment\nsigned an agreement with the Chinese\nMinistry of Environmental Protection\nin December to promote the sustaina-\nble development of the Belt and Road.\n\nThere are many ways we will sup-\nport this. Our environmental expert-\nise runs from sustainable finance and\nclean technologies to ecosystems and\nsustainable consumption and produc-\ntion. UN Environment can support\n\ntechnology transfer and the creating\nof green economy policies. Through\nour Finance Initiative, we can\nwork with private investors to\npromote sustainable invest-\nment practices along the Belt\nand Road.\nBut we cannot do it\nalone. Many other stake-\nholder groups, investors,\nand businesses have val-\nuable expertise to bring\nto the table. And many\n\nBelt and Road coun-\n\ntries have asked spe-\n\ncifically for such\nsupport to make sure\nthat the Belt and\nRoad Initiative helps\nthem meet their sus-\ntainable development\nneeds.\n\nAnd s0, at the Belt\nand Road Forum for\n\nInternational Cooper-\n\nation in Beijing this\nweek, UN Environment\nand China’s Ministry of\nEnvironmental Protec-\ntion will announce the\nInternational Coalition for\nGreen Development on the\nBelt and Road.\nUN Environment and Chi-\nna will bring together dozens\nof partner organizations in this\ncoalition. We want to draw\nknowledge from the largest body\nof environmental expertise possible\nto ensure that Belt and Road brings\nlong-term, planet-friendly growth.\n\nThe forum this week will bring\ntogether a significant portion of that\nexpertise. I see it as the beginning of a\nclose collaboration and hope to grow\nour coalition. We all want the Belt and\nRoad Initiative to fulfil its promise as\na positive force for development. We\nmust work together to ensure that\ndevelopment is sustainable.\n\nThe author is head of\nUN Environment.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023570\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

So should Apollo take advantage\nof the overhauled tax rules to pay less in taxes? Or should it\nuse this chance to change to an Inc. from an LLC, which would\nincrease its tax bill but allow it to attract investments from\nmutual funds that have previously been out of reach?\n\n“We're still analyzing,”’ Black told the Goldman Sachs U.S.\nFinancial Services Conference Dec. 6. “It’s an uncertain\noutcome.”\n\nEither way, it’s most likely a money-making outcome. The\n\ntax changes are a boon for private equity firms such as Apollo,\nwhere Black is chief executive officer. The new lower corporate\nrate has made it possible for bigger publicly traded\npartnerships to consider the change. As it is, management fees,\nwhich typically account for 30 percent or more of their\nearnings, are already taxed at the corporate rate. That will\ndrop. The legislation scarcely touched the 23.8 percent rate\npaid on incentive fees, also called carried interest, which\n\nincur no additional levy when paid out to shareholders.\n\nDouble Tax\n\nIf the partnerships converted to corporations, the\n\nincentive fees would be hit with a second layer of tax when\nthey’re paid out. That would push the combined tax rate on\nincentive income paid out as dividends to nearly 40 percent,\naccording to Peter Furci, co-chair of Debevoise & Plimpton’s\nglobal tax practice.\n\nBut it would also allow the newly minted corporations\n\naccess to indexes, and therefore the mutual-fund and ETF\nmarkets. About $2.2 trillion follows the S&P 500 Index,\naccording to its website. As of June, $122.6 billion in assets\ntracked the Russell 2000 Index, the best-known small-cap U.S.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023564\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

OLC’S DISTORTION OF THE CVRA’S STRUCTURE AND LEGISLATIVE\nHISTORY\n\nThe next section of OLC’s memorandum maintains that the CVRA’s\nstructure and legislative history lead to the conclusion that the CVRA is\n“best understood” as extending rights after charges have been filed. Here\nagain, OLC’s analysis is truncated at best and misleading at worst.\n\nOLC begins this part of its analysis by observing that some of the\nrights in the CVRA are limited to court proceedings. OLC notes, for\nexample, that the CVRA gives victims the “right to reasonable, accurate,\nand timely notice of any public court proceeding ... involving the\ncrime.”''’ But the fact that some of the rights listed in the CVRA apply to\ncourt proceedings hardly means that all of the rights are to be so restricted.\nThe federal criminal justice process includes stages that are pre-charging,\npost-charging, and post-conviction. It would hardly be surprising to find\nthat a statute that Congress intended to be “broad and encompassing”™!!®\ncovered events occurring after the filing of charges.\n\nIndeed, OLC appears to recognize that at least three of the rights listed\nin the CVRA could easily apply before charges are filed: (1) the “right to be\nreasonably protected from the accused”; (2) the “reasonable right to confer\nwith the attorney for the Government in the case”; and (3) the “right to be\ntreated with faimess and with respect for the victim’s dignity and\nprivacy.”!!° None of these rights explicitly refer to court “proceedings” or\nother events (such as parole hearings) that necessarily occur after the filing\nof formal charges.'”°\n\n15 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 5-6.

As much as his full length books such as The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, and The God Delusion,\nhave changed our perceptions of both science and the world it opens, his essays and articles are potent, pithy,\nthought provoking and revealing windows into the world as he, himself, perceives it. Science in the Soul is a\ncollection of some of Dawkins' best writing: articles and lectures, reflections and polemics, reviews, forewords,\ntributes or eulogies, both published and unpublished.\n\nFrom the introduction, by Gillian Somerscales: \"Richard Dawkins has always defied categorization. One\neminent biologist of mathematical bent reviewing The Selfish Gene and The Extended Phenotype was startled to\nfind a scientific work apparently free of logical errors and yet containing not a single line of mathematics; he\ncould come to no other conclusion than that, incomprehensible as it seemed to him, “Dawkins . . . apparently\nthinks in prose.’\n\n\"If readers of what follows here come to appreciate not only the writer’s clarity of thought and facility of\nexpression, the fearlessness with which he confronts very large elephants in very small rooms, the energy with\nwhich he devotes himself to explication of the complex and the beautiful in science, but also some of the\ngenerosity, kindness and courtesy that have characterized all my dealings with Richard over the years since that\nfirst collaboration, then the present volume will have achieved one of its aims.\n\n\"It will have achieved another if it embodies a condition felicitously described in one of the essays reproduced\nhere, where ‘harmonious parts flourish in the presence of each other, and the illusion of a harmonious whole\nemerges.’ Indeed, it is my belief that the harmony resounding from this collection is no illusion, but the echo of\none of the most vibrant, and vital, voices of our times.\"\n\nRICHARD DAWKINS is the former Charles Simonyi Professor For The Understanding Of Science at Oxford\nUniversity; Fellow of New College; author of The Selfish Gene, The Extended Phenotype, The Blind\nWatchmaker, River out of Eden (ScienceMasters Series), Climbing Mount Improbable, Unweaving the\nRainbow, The Devil's Chaplain, The Ancestor's Tale, The God Delusion, The Greatest Show on Earth and The\nMagic of Reality. He 1s founder of The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science.\n\n-o\n\nFROM BACTERIA TO BACH AND BACK\n\nThe Evolution of Minds\n\nBy Daniel C. Dennett\n\n[US — W. W. Norton, UK — Penguin UK, Italy — Raffaello Cortina Editore, Holland — Atlas\nContact, China — Cheers, Audio — Recorded Books; Manuscript; Pub Date: February 2017; 448 pages]\n\nOne of the world’s foremost philosophers offers a major new account of the origins of the conscious mind.\nWhat is human consciousness and how is it possible? This question fascinates people from poets and painters to\nphysicists, psychologists, and philosophers. From Bacteria to Bach and Back is Daniel C. Dennett’s brilliant\nanswer, extending perspectives from his earlier work in surprising directions, exploring the deep interactions of\n\nevolution, brains, and human culture.\n\nPart philosophical whodunit, part bold scientific conjecture, this landmark work enlarges themes that have\nsustained Dennett’s legendary career at the forefront of philosophical thought.

Now let’s get to the interesting part. The press release implies that natural gas and renewable energy can reduce American\ndependence on foreign oil (“end” is the word used). This is an appealing proposition, particularly with Brent oil prices now 5 times\nhigher than natural gas prices on a BTU basis. So, let’s assume that the US wanted to cease all oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and\nthe Persian Gulf. This would reduce oil imports by ~30%. If Americans still wanted to drive around just as much, absent an increase\nof 2.8 million bpd in US domestic crude production, electricity would have to replace the foregone gasoline. Ergo: how much wind\npower or natural gas would be needed, assuming electric cars at 200 watt hours per km? And what policies would be needed on\nfracking, eminent domain, and subsidies for high voltage direct current power lines to transmit electricity at acceptable loss rates?\n\nNote: the charts below only account for the foregone gasoline component of the imported crude oil. Gasoline is only around 45%-\n50% of total refined products. The US would also have to come up with suitable domestic or foreign replacements for the rest of the\nbarrel: jet fuel, heating oil, fuel oil, lube oils, asphalt, etc. This is a topic that is often neglected in discussions about reducing reliance\non foreign oil: we do a lot more with it than just drive cars.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031149\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

When the children learned of this, they pleaded with their\nfather not to take his life. Peter relented. No one tried to talk Patricia out of her decision to\ncommit suicide, for two reasons: first, she had made up her mind; second, it wasn’t really suicide,\nsince her act would only hasten her imminent and painful demise by a few weeks.\n\nPatricia selected the day and time of her death and planned a formal farewell dinner for her family.\nAmong those in attendance, in addition to her husband and children, were her stepfather and her\ntwo half brothers.\n\nThere was wine and toasts. Patricia wore an elegant dress and had her nails polished. After\ndinner they watched the movie Harold and Maude, about an elderly woman who commits suicide\nto prevent herself from “growing old.” When it was over, Peter Rosier and his wife retired to the\nbedroom and made love. After bidding farewell to family members, Patricia Rosier took twenty\npills that she had selected for her suicide. She quickly fell into a coma, from which she expected\nnever to wake. Had her suicide succeeded, there would have been no case.\n\nBut soon the coma began to lighten. Peter didn’t know what to do or what to think. Would she\nawaken or remain comatose? Would there be brain damage? Pain? Emotional turmoil? All\nPeter knew was that his wife did not want to awaken. What was his obligation to his comatose\nwife? Would he be breaking his final promise to her if he did not assist her in achieving her goal:\na painless and dignified death? He could not ask her advice. The decision was his to make, but it\nwas her decision—she had already made it and acted on it, albeit incompletely.\n\nPeter administered morphine, but it was not enough. While Peter was outside the house, pacing\nand crying, Patricia’s stepfather decided to end her life by suffocating her. He placed his hands\nover her nose and mouth. She died in her sleep.\n\nThe stepfather and brothers simply informed Peter that Patricia had died, without providing any\nfurther details. For nearly a year, the circumstances surrounding Patricia’s death remained a\nfamily secret. Then Peter decided to do something foolhardy: he wrote a book about his late\nwife’s courage and gave an interview to a local television reporter in which he related what he\nbelieved were the circumstances of his wife’s death, still unaware that her stepfather had\nadministered the coup de grace.\n\nAs soon as the interview was aired, the local prosecutor began a murder investigation. They\nwanted to interview Patricia’s stepfather, but he demanded total immunity from prosecution for\nhimself and his sons as a condition of being interviewed. That should have tipped off the\nauthorities that he might have something to hide. But instead of asking for a “proffer” —a truthful\noutline of the facts—before deciding whether to grant immunity, the prosecutor simple agreed to\nhis condition.\n\nThe stepfather then disclosed for the first time that it was he who had caused Patricia’s death.\nThe prosecutors had committed a blunder feared by every law-enforcement official: they gave the\nwrong person immunity. But they could not back out of their deal. Now the only possible target\nwas Peter Rosier.\n\nDespite the certainty that Peter had not actually killed his wife, and that she wanted to take her\nown life, the prosecutor treated the loving husband as if he were indeed the triggerman in a\n\n193\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017280\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

A variety of viscous and\nunpleasant-looking fluids (yellow, reddish-orange, brown), dry materials (sawdust?\nflour?), and even insects drizzle or dust their way down the head, whose stoic sublimity is\nmade gorgeously virtual on the work’s enormous screens. Dead Imagine, through its\nlarge-scale and cubic “Platonic” form, remains both artificial and locked into the body—\nrefusing a detached “intelligence” as being no intelligence at all.\n\nArtists in the new millennium inherit this critical tradition and inhabit the current\nparadigms of AI, which has slid from partial simulations to claims of intelligence. In the\n1955 proposal thought to be the first printed usage of the phrase “artificial intelligence,”\ncomputer scientist John McCarthy and his colleagues Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel\nRochester, and Claude Shannon conjectured that “every aspect of learning or any other\nfeature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be\nmade to simulate it.” This modest theoretical goal has inflated over the past sixty-four\nyears and is now expressed by Google DeepMind as an ambition to “Solve intelligence.”\nCrack the code! But unfortunately, what we hear cracking is not code but small-scale\ncapitalism, the social contract, and the scaffolding of civility. Taking away the jobs of\ntaxi and truck drivers, roboticizing direct marketing, hegemonizing entertainment,\nprivatizing utilities, and depersonalizing health care—are these the “whips” that Wiener\nfeared we would learn to love?\n\nArtists can’t solve any of this. But they can remind us of the creative potential of\nthe paths not taken—the forks in the road that were emerging around 1970, before\n“information” became capital and “intelligence” equaled data harvesting. Richly\nevocative of what can be done with contemporary tools when revisiting earlier\npossibilities is French artist Philippe Parreno’s “firefly piece,” so nicknamed to avoid\nhaving to iterate its actual title: With a Rhythmic Instinction to Be Able to Travel Beyond\nExisting Forces of Life (2014). Described by the artist as “an automaton,” the sculptural\ninstallation juxtaposes a flickering projection of black-and-white drawings of fireflies\nwith a band of oscillating green-on-black binary figures. The drawings and binary\nfigures are animated using algorithms from mathematician John Horton Conway’s 1970\nGame of Life, a “cellular automaton.”\n\nConway set up parameters for any square (“cell”) to be lit (“alive”) or dark\n(“dead”) in an infinite, two-dimensional grid. The rules are summarized as follows: A\nsingle cell will quickly die of loneliness. But a cell touching three or more other “live”\ncells will also die, “due to crowding.” A cell survives and thrives if it has just two\nneighbors... and soon. As one cell dies, it may create the conditions for other cells to\nsurvive, yielding patterns that appear to move and grow, shifting across the grid like\nevanescent neural impulses or bioluminescent clusters of diatoms. In Stephen Hawking’s\n2012 film The Meaning of Life, the narrator describes Conway’s mathematical model as\nsimulating “how a complex thing like the mind might come about from a basic set of\nrules,” revealing the overweening ambitions that characterize contemporary AI: “[T]hese\ncomplex properties emerge from simple laws that contain no concepts like movement or\nreproduction,” yet they produce “species,” and cells “can even reproduce, just as life does\nin the real world.” °°\n\nJust as life does? Artists know the blandishments of simulation and\nrepresentation, the difference between the genius of artifice and the realities of what “life\n\n°° Narration in Stephen Hawking’s The Meaning of Life (Smithson Productions, Discovery Channel, 2012).\n\n178\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016398\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Dominos would fall. Targets\nwould flip.\n\nPaul Manafort, making a good living in international financial gray areas, his risk\ncalculation based on the long-shot odds that an under-the-radar privateer would ever\nreceive close scrutiny, would now be subjected to microscopic review. His nemesis, Oleg\nDeripaska—still pursuing his $17 million claim against Manafort and himself looking for\nfavorable treatment from federal authorities who had restricted his travel to the United\nStates—was continuing his own deep investigation into Manafort’s Russian and Ukrainian\nbusiness affairs.\n\nTom Barrack, privy to the president’s stream of consciousness as well as his financial\nhistory, was suddenly taking stock of his own exposure. Indeed, all the billionaire friends\nwith whom Trump got on the phone and gossiped and rambled were potential witnesses.\n\nIn the past, administrations forced to deal with a special prosecutor appointed to\ninvestigate and prosecute matters with which the president might have been involved\nusually became consumed by the effort to cope. Their tenure broke into “before” and\n“after” periods—with the “after” period hopelessly bogged down in the soap opera of G-\nman pursuit. Now it looked like the “after” period would be almost the entirety of the\nTrump administration.\n\nThe idea of formal collusion and artful conspiracy—as media and Democrats more or\nless breathlessly believed or hoped had happened between Trump and the Russians—\nseemed unlikely to everybody in the White House. (Bannon’s comment that the Trump\ncampaign was not organized enough to collude with its own state organizations became\neverybody’s favorite talking point—not least because it was true.) But nobody was\nvouching for the side deals and freelance operations and otherwise nothing-burger stuff\nthat was a prosecutor’s daily bread and the likely detritus of the Trump hangers-on. And\neverybody believed that if the investigation moved into the long chain of Trump financial\ntransactions, it would almost certainly reach the Trump family and the Trump White\nHouse.\n\nAnd then there was the president’s insistent claim that he could do something. J can\nfire him, he would say. Indeed, it was another of his repetitive loops: I can fire him. I can\nfire him. Mueller. The idea of a showdown in which the stronger, more determined, more\nintransigent, more damn-the-consequences man prevails was central to Trump’s own\npersonal mythology. He lived in a mano a mano world, one in which if your own\nrespectability and sense of personal dignity were not a paramount issue—if you weren’t\nweak in the sense of needing to seem like a reasonable and respectable person—you had a\nterrific advantage. And if you made it personal, if you believed that when the fight really\nmattered that it was kill or be killed, you were unlikely to meet someone willing to make it\nas personal as you were.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020065\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I was midway through The World Is Flat, the bestseller by Tom Friedman. I\nlike Friedman, despite his puzzling decision to wear a mustache. His book is all about how outsourcing\nto India and China is not just for tech support and carmakers but is poised to transform every industry in\nAmerica, from law to banking to accounting.\n\nI don’t have a corporation; I don’t even have an up-to-date business card. I’m a writer and editor\nworking from home, usually in my boxer shorts or, if ’'m feeling formal, my penguin-themed pajama\nbottoms. Then again, I think, why should Fortune 500 firms have all the fun? Why can’t I join in on the\nbiggest business trend of the new century? Why can’t I outsource my low-end tasks? Why can’t I\noutsource my life?\n\nThe next day I e-mail Brickwork, one of the companies Friedman mentions in his book. Brickwork —\nbased in Bangalore, India—offers “remote executive assistants,” mostly to financial firms and healthcare\ncompanies that want data processed. I explain that I'd like to hire someone to help with Esquire-related\ntasks —doing research, formatting memos, like that. The company’s CEO, Vivek Kulkarni, responds, “It\nwould be a great pleasure to be talking to a person of your stature.” Already I’m liking this. ve never\nhad stature before. In America, I barely command respect from a Bennigan’s maitre d’, so it’s nice to\nknow that in India I have stature.\n\nA couple of days later, I get an e-mail from my new “remote executive assistant.”\n\nDear Jacobs,\n\nMy name is Honey K. Balani. I would be assisting you in your editorial and personal job.... I\nwould try to adapt myself as per your requirements that would lead to desired satisfaction.\n\nDesired satisfaction. This is great. Back when I worked at an office, I had assistants, but there was\nnever any talk of desired satisfaction. In fact, if anyone ever used the phrase “desired satisfaction,” we’d\nall end up in a solemn meeting with HR.\n\nI GO OUT to dinner with my friend Misha, who grew up in India, founded a software firm, and\nsubsequently became nauseatingly rich. I tell him about Operation Outsource. “You should call Your\nMan in India,” he says. Misha explains that this is a company for Indian businessmen who have moved\noverseas but who still have parents back in New Delhi or Mumbai. YMII is their overseas concierge\nservice—it buys movie tickets and cell phones and other sundries for abandoned moms.\n\nPerfect. This could kick my outsourcing up to a new level. I can have a nice, clean division of labor:\nHoney will take care of my business affairs, and YMII can attend to my personal life—pay my bills,\nmake vacation reservations, buy stuff online. Happily, YMII likes the idea, and just like that the support\nteam at Jacobs Inc. has doubled.\n\nHONEY HAS completed her first project for me: research on the person Esquire has chosen as the\nSexiest Woman Alive. I’ve been assigned to write a profile of this woman, and I really don’t want to\nhave to slog through all the heavy-breathing fan websites about her.

Schmidt, Provost\nMaria T. Zuber, Vice President for Research\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nWe are writing to alert you to an issue that threatens all of MIT’s federally funded research activities but that is often underappreciated.\nWerre referring to the Trump Administration’s proposal to put a 10 percent cap on indirect cost reimbursements to universities by the\nNational Institutes of Health — an idea that is already beginning to be talked about for other federal agencies as well.\n\nAn article explaining indirect costs and why they are important to MIT can be found in the most recent Faculty\nNewsletter: http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/295/zuber.html.\n\nThe Administration’s proposed cuts to federal R&D agency budgets have rightly been met with consternation on campus. The indirect\ncost cap proposal is actually an even graver danger because it is easier for the government to institute, and it would do far-reaching\ndamage that is harder to reverse. We need faculty and research staff to understand the devastating effects that capping indirect cost\nwould cause to MIT and other research institutions.\n\nThe indirect cost cap is easier to implement than a cut to the budget because the Administration can act unilaterally without\nCongressional approval. The proposed agency budget cuts are already running into strong headwinds on both sides of the aisle in\nCongress, and they cannot move forward without 60 votes in the U.S. Senate. The indirect cost cap, by contrast, does not attract the\nsame level of attention because it is not well understood, and the Administration can simply impose a cap — at a single agency, or at all\nof them (since indirect cost reimbursement is fairly uniform across the government now).\n\nWhat would a 10 percent cap mean for MIT? A 10 percent cap on all federal agencies would cost MIT around $100 million a year. To\nput that in context, the financial crisis of 2008, where we saw a significant decline in endowment, required us to reduce spending by this\nsame order of magnitude. Fortunately, the recovery of the endowment was relatively quick, and we were able to recoup some of that\nloss. In this case, the 10 percent cap is unlikely to be altered in the foreseeable future. Since this is a recurring cost, attempting to\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029429\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Greenburg and Derek D. Smith\n\nJune 20, 2011 -- The reconciliation agreement signed in April\nbetween Fatah and Hamas, which called for the creation of an interim\nPalestinian unity government followed by elections later this year,\nraises a number of difficult issues for the United States. Among these\nis whether Washington can lawfully continue to provide aid to the\nPalestinian Authority (PA) if it includes Hamas as an equal partner.\nAfter all, existing U.S. law designates Hamas as a terrorist\norganization and thus prevents the United States from aiding it in any\nway. Although the unity pact suffered a setback when a planned\nconference in Cairo on Tuesday to announce a new government was\npostponed, negotations are ongoing. Should the two sides eventually\nsucceed in creating a unity government, continued U.S. funding for\nthe PA could be illegal. Despite this, given the PA’s dependence on\nU.S. aid, Washington may decide that financially sustaining the\nPalestinian leadership is vital to the peace process or other strategic\ninterests. As a result, it may attempt to continue aiding elements of\nthe PA that remain unaffiliated with Hamas. Yet absent specific\ncongressional authorization, such a strategy will face significant legal\nobstacles.\n\nU.S. law has long prohibited citizens from providing support to or\ndoing business with Hamas, which has been on the Treasury\nDepartment’s designated terrorist list since 1995 and the State\nDepartment’s list of designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations since\n1997.

But even on the first day of\nthe war, it was clear that it would be by far the most consequential conflict in\nour country’s history. There was no mission for Sayeret Matkal, nor, it seemed,\nany prospect of our playing any significant part.\n\nThe fact that my own role was slightly less peripheral was due to Avraham\nArnan. He phoned me almost as soon as we’d got news of the Israeli air victory,\nand told me he had been told to take a few men from the sayeret across the\nsouthern border. Our assignment was to complete our failed attempt to defuse\nthe booby-trap on the intercept in the Sinai. I quickly drafted in two others from\nthe unit. One was Danny Michaelson, a friend from Hebrew University, where\nwe had been lab partners. The other was Rafi Friedman, our paramedic, who\nhad been with me on several of our missions on the Golan.\n\nAvraham arrived at the base around noon. I got a Jeep and we set off. We\ncrossed into Egypt around four o’clock in the afternoon and headed for the field\nheadquarters of Israel Tal. Known as Talik, he was the commander of Israel’s\narmored corps, and Avraham knew him well. His wartime division consisted of\nthe country’s premier tank unit, the Seventh Armored Brigade, and a reserve\nbrigade. We accompanied them the next day to an abandoned Egyptian camp\nnot far from El Arish, in the northern Sinai. At least, we’d assumed it was\nabandoned. As Talik and Avraham were talking in his command post, we heard a\nsudden burst of gunfire, which seemed to come from just a few dozen yards\noutside. As everyone inside the command post looked around, Avraham turned\nto me and said: “Ehud, don’t you think we ought to deal with it?” Then, to\nTalik: “Make sure none of your guys shoots him.”\n\nI got Danny and Rafi. We made our way toward an underground bunker,\nwhich seemed the most likely source of the gunfire. Hugging the wall as I led\nthe way down a series of concrete steps, I clicked off the safety on my Uzi just\nin case. But with the main Egyptian forces in obvious retreat, I figured that\nwhoever was doing the shooting would have to be shellshocked, or insanely\nbrave, to put up a fight. There were eight men crouched inside, soldiers and\nseveral staff officers cradling Kalashnikovs, and an Egyptian army general. In\nwhat was obviously at least serviceable Arabic, I told them all to raise their\nhands. I made a brief attempt to interrogate the general, but quickly reached the\nlimits of my linguistic proficiency. So we marched them away and handed them\nover to Talik’s intelligence officers.\n\n89\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011560\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He spent 13 months of a 18-month sentence in jail and\nremains a registered sex offender.\nSeveral of his famous friends cut ties- including Clinton and then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer who\nreturned his campaign donations- but not all of them: Prince Andrew reportedly stayed at Epstein's\nmansion in New York in 2010, months after he was released from jail.\nChelsea Clinton leaves hospital with new baby Charlotte\nKeeping ties: Clinton was also friends with an unnamed woman who stored pictures of\nunderage girls for Epstein, and though Clinton cut ties with Epstein after his arrest, he\ninvited the woman to Chelsea's 2010 wedding\nClinton's connection to Epstein, who worked as a financier and education philanthropist before more than\n40 women came forward with claims about him being a sexual predator, has been long-established, but\nThe Enquirer also tells how the former president was also friends with some of Epstein's seedy\nacquaintances.\nThe lawsuit claims that Clinton was friends with an unnamed woman who 'kept images of naked underage\nchildren on her computer, helped to recruit underage children for Epstein... and photographed underage\nfemales in sexually explicit poses'.\nWhile he cut off ties with Epstein, this woman's abuses apparently did not end their relationship as she\nwas reportedly one of the 400 guests at Chelsea Clinton's 2010 wedding.\nLatest ladies: Clinton was pictured posing for a photo with Barbie Girl (left) and Ava Adora\n(right), two known prostitutes who work at the Bunny Brothel in Nevada\nThough the lawsuit may be bringing up sexual skeleton's from Clinton's past, he has added to the drama of\nlate by posing for a photo with two known prostitutes at a fundraiser in Los Angeles last month.\nThe drama of his extramarital affairs is apparently just one concern for Clinton family loyalists, as a Wall\nStreet Journal article released today details how\n'I'm not in the political camp; I'm in the friends camp.

Raw Land Investment. A qualifying foreign pension fund invests in a partnership that buys raw land\nin the United States. (This could be a vacant lot, timberland, oil and gas or mineral property, or other\nproperty interests that qualify for treatment as real property for federal income tax purposes.) The\ninvestment is a capital asset, as the partnership is not engaged in business. The partnership later sells\nthe property to a developer, or the pension fund sells its partnership interest. Under prior law, the\nforeign pension fund's non-business capital gain would automatically be subject to US federal income\ntax because of FIRPTA. Under the new law, the foreign pension fund's long-term or short-term capital\ngain is exempt from U.S. income tax and FIRPTA withholding because FIRPTA does not apply.\n\nB. Equity Kicker Mortgage Loan Investment. A foreign pension fund acquires an ownership interest\nin a mortgage loan secured by U.S. real property. The loan includes stated interest plus an equity\nkicker (e.g., additional interest equal to a share of gain realized on sale of the property). Such an\nequity kicker loan is treated as a U.S. real property interest under FIRPTA. Under prior law, gain\nrealized by the foreign pension fund upon sale of the loan would automatically be subject to U.S.\nincome tax under FIRPTA. Under new law, the gain realized on the sale of the mortgage loan would\nbe exempt from U.S. income tax. (This conclusion is based on the assumption that the foreign pension\nfund is a mere investor and not engaged in an active lending business in the U.S.)\n\nC. U.S. Blocker Corp. Investment. A foreign pension fund wants to make an equity investment in a\nU.S. real estate business that is organized as a partnership. The foreign pension fund forms a U.S.\ncorporation to acquire the partnership interest and the corporation is capitalized with a mix of equity\nand debt held by the shareholder. The corporation is subject to U.S. income tax on its net income, but\ngets to deduct interest paid or accrued on the debt held by the shareholder. The foreign corporation\nlater sells the stock of the corporation. Under prior law, the gain on sale of the stock would be subject\nto U.S. income tax because the corporation was a \"U.S. real property holding corporation\" under\nFIRPTA. Under new law, FIRPTA does not apply to the foreign pension fund, so the capital gain on sale\nof the stock is exempt from U.S. income tax. Note that the U.S.-source interest paid to the foreign\nshareholder could be subject to U.S. withholding tax under the regular rules of the Code, but if the\npension fund is organized in a jurisdiction that has a tax treaty with the U.S. (e.g., UK, Germany,\nFrance, China, Japan, etc.), these interest payments could be exempt from U.S. withholding under such\ntax treaty.\n\n2. FIRPTA EXEMPTION FOR INVESTMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED REIT STOCK INCREASED FROM 5\nPERCENT to 10 PERCENT\n\nFor publicly traded REITs, the PATH Act opens the door to increased investment by expanding the\ncurrent statutory exemption from FIRPTA for small portfolio investments by non-U.S. persons. The Act\nprovides all foreign investors (not just pension funds) can now own up to 10 percent of the stock of a\npublicly traded REIT without triggering FIRPTA tax. Under prior law, FIRPTA tax would apply upon the\nforeign investor's sale of stock of the publicly traded REIT or the receipt of certain distributions from\nsuch REIT if the foreign investor holds more than 5 percent of the REIT's stock.\n\n3. CLARIFICATION OF THE EXEMPTION FOR INVESTMENTS IN DOMESTICALLY CONTROLLED REITS\nThe PATH Act includes important clarifying presumptions that will allow publicly traded REITs and their\nshareholders to rely with greater confidence on the current law FIRPTA exemption for gains realized\non sales of stock in \"domestically controlled\" REITS. In determining whether a REIT is domestically\ncontrolled, the REIT is now permitted to presume that any owner of less than 5 percent of any publicly\n\ntraded shares of the REIT is a U.S. person, unless the REIT has actual knowledge to the contrary.\n\n4.

The objections reflect a natural defensive reaction, coupled perhaps with a\nlack of imagination about what a superintelligent machine could do. None hold water on\ncloser examination. Here are some of the more common ones:\n\ne Don’t worry, we can just switch it off? This is often the first thing that pops into a\nlayperson’s head when considering risks from superintelligent Al—as if a\nsuperintelligent entity would never think of that. This is rather like saying that the\nrisk of losing to DeepBlue or AlphaGo is negligible—all one has to do is make\nthe right moves.\n\ne Human-level or superhuman AI is impossible This is an unusual claim for AI\nresearchers to make, given that, from Turing onward, they have been fending off\nsuch claims from philosophers and mathematicians. The claim, which is backed\nby no evidence, appears to concede that if superintelligent AI were possible, it\nwould be a significant risk. It’s as if a bus driver, with all of humanity as\npassengers, said, “Yes, I am driving toward a cliff—in fact, I’m pressing the pedal\nto the metal! But trust me, we’ll run out of gas before we get there!” The claim\nrepresents a foolhardy bet against human ingenuity. We have made such bets\nbefore and lost. On September 11, 1933, renowned physicist Ernest Rutherford\nstated, with utter confidence, “Anyone who expects a source of power from the\ntransformation of these atoms is talking moonshine.” On September 12, 1933,\nLeo Szilard invented the neutron-induced nuclear chain reaction. A few years\nlater he demonstrated such a reaction in his laboratory at Columbia University.\nAs he recalled in a memoir: “We switched everything off and went home. That\nnight, there was very little doubt in my mind that the world was headed for grief.”\n\ne It’s too soon to worry about it. The right time to worry about a potentially serious\nproblem for humanity depends not just on when the problem will occur but also\non how much time is needed to devise and implement a solution that avoids the\nrisk. For example, if we were to detect a large asteroid predicted to collide with\nthe Earth in 2067, would we say, “It’s too soon to worry”? And if we consider\nthe global catastrophic risks from climate change predicted to occur later in this\ncentury, is it too soon to take action to prevent them? On the contrary, it may be\ntoo late. The relevant timescale for human-level AI is less predictable, but, like\nnuclear fission, it might arrive considerably sooner than expected. One variation\non this argument is Andrew Ng’s statement that it’s “like worrying about\noverpopulation on Mars.” This appeals to a convenient analogy: Not only is the\n\n? AI researcher Jeff Hawkins, for example, writes, “Some intelligent machines will be virtual, meaning they\nwill exist and act solely within computer networks. .. . It is always possible to turn off a computer network,\neven if painful.” https:/Avww.recode.net/2015/3/2/11559576/.\n\n3 The AI100 report (Peter Stone et al.), sponsored by Stanford University, includes the following: “Unlike\nin the movies, there is no race of superhuman robots on the horizon or probably even possible.”\nhttps://ail00.stanford.edu/20 16-report.\n\n31\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016834\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. P’ve just been. You will never\nthink the same way about anything again.”\n\nSo spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up everywhere at the moment\nas the alleged “procurer” of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEpstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of another\ninvestigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with allegations that he molested\nthem when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British newspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein’s\nfriendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to publicly disassociate himself from his old pal.\n\nI wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called “The Talented Mr. Epstein.” It was largely a business piece that focused on his\nmysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les Wexner, the chairman of Limited\nBrands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail\nsentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of $450 million.\n\nThe piece alluded to Epstein’s great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women with whom he had\nsexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn’t really go there, focusing instead on the issue that remains a mystery—how\nJeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers.\n\nThis is not to say I didn’t hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on the intriguing\nfinancial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same ones, different ones. And their stories are bone-\nchilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one case, flown—to ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he?\nAnd the British, especially, want to know: Who is she? At this point, Iam so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all,\nmy 2003 Vanity Fairstory that really brought him into the limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself.\n\nBizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. | kept running into both of\nthem, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of young women with him who stand two feet\nbehind him, as if serving a monarch. “Do they speak?” I remember asking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He\nlaughed. “Not like vou, Vicky,” was his riposte.\n\nIremembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn’t studied math\n\nsince I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at home via messenger. It was a\nbook: “Math for idiots.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030525\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

She hadn’t seen it until a week afterwards. She said that\nof course she would have come with me. She felt angry with herself, and with\nme too, for not simply having phoned. But since I didn’t contact her in the\nweeks that followed, she figured this was just another one of our times apart. Or\n“stupid pride”. A few months later, I heard she was engaged to be married, to a\nyoung man she’d known since their high school days at the Alliance.\n\nI had first met Nava Cohen, the woman I would go on to marry, the previous\nyear. It was through another Cohen, though they were not related: Nechemia,\nmy sayeret friend who was killed in the 1967 war. He invited me to Tel Aviv\nfor a party in the spring, on the Jewish holiday of Purim, and introduced us.\nNava was just nineteen, five years younger than me. I was struck not just by the\nfact she was attractive, but by her poise, warm-heartedness, and her obvious\nintelligence. But she had her boyfriend with her, and I still saw myself and Nili\nas life partners. Now, she was beginning her studies at Hebrew University as\nwell, and, in a way, it was again Nechemia\n\nCohen who brought us together. Since his death, those of us who knew him\nfrom the sayeret had been looking for a fitting way to remember and to honor\nhim. We finally decided to set up a living memorial in his name: a Moadon\nSayarim, a center to train young people from all over Jerusalem in scouting and\nnavigation. We spent six months getting it up and running, and Nava pitched in\nwith the work.\n\nIt wasn’t until a few months after I heard of Nili’s engagement that I finally\nasked her on a date. We were in the university library, which had a space where\nyou could listen to tapes through headphones. I would go to hear classical\nmusic. Nava was studying English literature, and I’d sometimes see her there,\nengrossed in recordings of Shakespeare with the text of Hamlet or Macbeth in\nfront of her. Since I wasn’t shackled by the need to follow the alacks and\nalasses, I read the newspaper as the music washed over me. I turned to the\nmovie section. I circled three films, drew a question mark in the margin and\npassed it to her. She looked puzzled for a second. Then she smiled and put a\ncheckmark next to one of them.\n\nWhile we came from different backgrounds, the gap was narrower than it\nhad been with Nili. Her parental home was in Tiberias. Her parents were from\nold Sephardi families, with a centuries-long history in Palestine, and were also\nsolid Ben-Gurion Labor supporters. Her father had fought in the British army in\nthe Second World War. He now ran the branch of Bank Leumi in Tiberias. Her\nmother ran a shop in what was then the city’s best hotel, the Ginton.\n\n103\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011574\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The bond he once had with them, forged through mutual\ncelebrity and a shared proprietary sense of politics (Scarborough, the former congressman,\nseemed to feel that he ought reasonably to be president as much as Donald Trump felt he\nshould be), had distinguished the show during the campaign; now its public fraying\nbecame part of the daily news cycle. Scarborough and Brzezinski lectured him, channeled\nthe concerns of his friends and family, upbraided him, and openly worried about him—\nthat he was getting the wrong advice (Bannon) and, too, that his mental powers were\nslipping. They also staked a claim at representing the reasonable center-right alternative to\nthe president, and indeed were quite a good barometer of both the center-right’s efforts to\ndeal with him and its day-to-day difficulties of living with him.\n\nTrump, believing he had been used and abused by Scarborough and Brzezinski,\nclaimed he’d stopped watching the show. But Hope Hicks, every morning, quaking, had to\nrecount it for him.\n\nMorning Joe was a ground-zero study in the way the media had over-invested in\nTrump. He was the whale against which media emotions, self-regard, ego, joie de guerre,\ncareer advancement, and desire to be at the center of the story, too, all churned in nearly\necstatic obsession. In reverse regard, the media was the same whale, serving the same\nfunction, for Trump.\n\nTo this Trump added another tic, a lifelong sense that people were constantly taking\nunfair advantage of him. This perhaps came from his father’s cheapness and lack of\ngenerosity, or from his own overawareness of being a rich kid (and, no doubt, his\ninsecurities about this), or from a negotiator’s profound understanding that it is never win-\nwin, that where there is profit there is loss.

Moreover,\nby advertising these accounts, Al Rajhi Bank “provid[ed] a mechanism to allow al Qaida’s supporters to deposit funds\ndirectly into those accounts.” JA3828.\n\nAl Rajhi Bank’s operations are consistent with their support of al-Qaeda front charities. In 1999, Al Rajhi Bank was warned.\nby United States government officials “that their financial systems were being manipulated or utilized to fund terrorist\norganizations such as Al Qaeda.” SPA5S5 (Terrorist Attacks I; JA 2584-86; infra pp. 93-95. “Despite these warnings, Al\nRajhi failed to adopt even the most minimal standards, [which] resulted in the use of Al Rajhi as an instrument of terror ...”\nSPAS55 (Terrorist Attacks J). By ignoring the most basic banking standards “designed to thwart the support of terrorist\nnetworks,” such as “anti-terrorist money laundering safeguards and ‘know your customer’ regulations,” Al Rajhi Bank\nwillfully turned a blind eye towards the true nature of these charities. JA2483.\n\n*81 (b) Saudi American Bank\"\n\nPlaintiffs’ complaints allege that Saudi American Bank has knowingly provided various forms of material support to\nal-Qaeda. For example, “Saudi American Bank knowingly provided material support and resources to al Qaida” by “finance\n[ing] many of the projects undertaken by Osama bin Laden and al Qaida in the Sudan during the years that the al Qaida\nleadership structure operated from that country ....” JA843-44, 3843. This included projects such as “the construction of\nmajor roads and the Port of Sudan airport.” JA3843.\n\nSaudi American Bank is also alleged to have “knowingly provided financial services and other forms of material support to al\nQaida.” JA3844. It did this by “maintain[ing] accounts for many of the ostensible charities that operate within al Qaida’s\ninfrastructure, including MWL, WAMY, IRO and al Haramain” with “know[ledge] that [these] accounts ... were being used\nto solicit and transfer funds to terrorist organizations, including al *82 Qaida.” JA843-44, 3843-44. “Saudi American Bank\nalso serve[d] as the Saudi Arabia correspondent for many other banks within at Qaida’s infrastructure ....” JA843-44, 3844.\n\nPlaintiffs further allege that “Saudi American Bank facilit[ated] al Qaida’s fundraising efforts” by “advertis[ing] the existence\nand numerical designation of the accounts it maintain[ed] for those charities throughout the Muslim world, and provid[ing] a\nmechanism to allow al Qaida supporters to deposit funds directly into those accounts.” JA3844. These actions were alleged to\nhave been done “[i]n cooperation with the charities operating within al Qaida’s infrastructure ....” JA3844. Also, plaintiffs\nallege that in “2000, the Saudi American Bank participated in the fund raising campaign in Saudi Arabia for collecting\ndonations to the ‘heroes of the Al Quds uprising’ (Intifada) by providing a bank account and facilities to receive donations for\na committee of charity organizations including [WAMY], [IIRO,] and al Haramain Foundation.” JA844. In addition,\nplaintiffs allege that “from 1996 through 2001, the Saudi American Bank funneled money to and/or from the Spanish al\nQaida cell.” JA4385.\n\n*83 (c) Saleh Abdullah Kamel and Dallah al Baraka\n\nPlaintiffs’ complaints allege that Saleh Abdullah Kamel, a Saudi businessman, has knowingly provided extensive material\nsupport to al-Qaeda, both individually and through his various business entities, including Dallah al Baraka. JA3869-70. For\nexample, the complaints allege that Kamel personally “has made substantial contributions to many of the charities operating\nwithin al Qaeda’s infrastructure, with full knowledge that those funds would be used to support al Qaida’s operations and\nterrorist attacks.” JA3869-70. He is also alleged to have “long provided financial support and other forms of material support\nto terrorist organizations,” such as al-Qaeda. JA3162. Kamel’s role as a key financial supporter of al Qaeda’s is confirmed by\nhis inclusion on the Golden Chain. JA3164; see infra pp. 109-10. One such contribution is alleged to have occurred in 1992,\nwhen Kamel donated $100,000 to Sanabil Al-Khair, the North American financial arm of the TRO. JA3125. In addition,\ncomplaints allege that through personal investments, Kamel has provided financial support to publicly identified terrorist\norganizations, including by means of zakat donations requiring Kamel’s authorization. JA3173-74, 3193, 3200, 3869-70.\n\n*84 The complaints further allege that “Kamel financed and developed Dallah al Baraka and its subsidiaries to operate as\nprofitable banking and investment institutions and to serve as financial vehicles for transferring millions of dollars to Islamic\n\nmilitants around the world.” JA3162, 3869-70.

Of course, this may be a purely\npersonal failing, but when I talk to people in other companies they\nreport the same problem. It seems we all find communication difficult.\n\nhave wondered for many years why it is called the ‘art of\ncommunication. Surely it’s a science, governed by bits, bytes and\nbandwidth. That might be true of the symbols in an email — they are\nclearly encoded symbolically — but is the understanding in our brains\nsimply encoded by symbols? What is the physics that underlies human\nunderstanding?\n\nEach summer I go on holiday to escape engineering for a couple of\nweeks. While away I indulge my passion for reading books by the likes\nof Douglas Hofstadter, David Deutsch and Stephen Hawking. One book\nthat struck me years ago was Roger Penrose’s The Emperors New Mind.\nIn it, he tackles the question of what happens in the human brain when\nwe understand something. He extends an idea put forward by J.R. Lucas\nof Oxford University that minds must be more powerful than computers\nbecause they do something computers cannot: namely to step beyond\nmere rules and see truth. Colloquially we call this ‘common sense’ or\n‘stepping outside the box’\n\nThe Lucas argument uses the theories of Gédel and Turing to\nshow computer algorithms have limitations. Some things are simply\nnot computable. Computers can do many useful things, but they cannot\ndiscover new mathematical theorems, such as a proof of Fermat’s Last\nTheorem. In 1996, Andrew Wiles succeeded in finding a solution to this\nproblem. This presents a paradox, solved only if we conclude Andrew\nWiles is not a computer. Indeed, since most mathematicians discover at\nleast one theorem during their lives, we must conclude no mathematician\nis a computer! This is controversial. Most philosophers tend to the\nview put forward by Daniel Dennett that the Universe is an entirely\ndetermined place and any personal sense of free will and creativity is\nan illusion. In Dennett’s worldview, Andrew Wiles is a special purpose\nmachine that was always destined to solve Fermat’s Last Theorem. I\nbelieve this model is flawed. It is my aim in this book to show you why.\nIndeed I am going to go further and argue all human creativity is non-\ncomputational; art, communication, understanding - all are based on\nnon-algorithmic principles.\n\nIf you consider creative thinking deeply enough you're inevitably\ndrawn into the question of whether we have free will. When I get to\nwork each morning, the first thing I do — after a cup of coffee, obviously\n— is choose which creative task to tackle first.

This was not just a\nreasonable question, it was the question those around Trump most asked themselves. They\nconstantly struggled to figure out what they themselves actually thought and what they\nthought everybody else was truly thinking.\n\nMostly they kept their answers to themselves, but in the instance of Comey and\nMueller, beyond all the usual dodging and weaving rationalizations, there really wasn’t\nanybody, other than the president’s family, who didn’t very pointedly blame Trump\nhimself.\n\nThis was the point at which an emperors-new-clothes threshold was crossed. Now you\ncould, out loud, rather freely doubt his judgment, acumen, and, most of all, the advice he\nwas getting.\n\n“He’s not only crazy,” declared Tom Barrack to a friend, “he’s stupid.”\n\nBut Bannon, along with Priebus, had strongly opposed the Comey firing, while Ivanka\nand Jared had not only supported it, but insisted on it. This seismic event prompted a new\ntheme from Bannon, repeated by him widely, which was that every piece of advice from\nthe couple was bad advice.\n\nNobody now believed that firing Comey was a good idea; even the president seemed\nsheepish. Hence, Bannon saw his new role as saving Trump—and Trump would always\nneed saving. He might be a brilliant actor but he could not manage his own career.\n\nAnd for Bannon, this new challenge brought a clear benefit: when Trump’s fortune\nsank, Bannon’s rose.\n\nOn the trip to the Middle East, Bannon went to work. He became focused on the figure\nof Lanny Davis, one of the Clinton impeachment lawyers who, for the better part of two\nyears, became a near round-the-clock spokesperson and public defender of the Clinton\nWhite House. Bannon judged Comey-Mueller to be as threatening to the Trump White\nHouse as Monica Lewinsky and Ken Starr were to the Clinton White House, and he saw\nthe model for escaping a mortal fate in the Clinton response.\n\n“What the Clintons did was to go to the mattresses with amazing discipline,” he\nexplained. “They set up an outside shop and then Bill and Hillary never mentioned it\nagain. They ground through it. Starr had them dead to rights and they got through it.”\n\nBannon knew exactly what needed to be done: seal off the West Wing and build a\nseparate legal and communications staff to defend the president. In this construct, the\npresident would occupy a parallel reality, removed from and uninvolved with what would\nbecome an obvious partisan blood sport—as it had in the Clinton model. Politics would be\nrelegated to its nasty corner, and Trump would conduct himself as the president and as the\ncommander in chief.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020059\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

They could also make the system and its control lists better able to keep\npace with technological change, which had been a major problem with the old system,\nparticularly with regard to fast-moving information technologies. On the other hand, the\nreforms appear to loosen controls over dual-use technologies, which China has a long and\nsuccessful track record of integrating into advanced systems, and which can form the core\nof new innovations. The future of these reforms is unclear as the Trump administration\nappears to focus on more aggressive trade strategies and policies designed to protect US\nindustries and punish offending Chinese companies.\n\nStrong investment reviews\n\nThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is an interagency\ncommittee that serves the president in overseeing the national security implications of\nforeign investment in the economy.*’ As China’s economy and financial weight has grown,\nCFIUS has reviewed an increasing number of proposed acquisitions of American companies\nand infrastructure by Chinese entities. Many of these proposed mergers have received\nhigh levels of media and congressional attention, and most of the high-profile cases have\nended in rejection or strong discouragement leading to abandonment of the deal.

He\nappears to relish the company of super-rich oil billionaires from the Middle East, North Africa and the\nformer Soviet Union.\n\nThe peculiar sale of his former marital home to a Kazakh businessman for £15 million after it had\nlanguished unsold for five years at £12 million has never been satisfactorily explained.\n\nIn the recent leak of American diplomatic cables it was revealed that he had criticised an official\ncorruption investigation into the huge Al-Yamamah arms deal between Britain and Saudi Arabia, while he\nis also said to be close to Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the beleaguered Libyan president, and may have\nhad a role in the early release of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Al Megrahi.\n\nWhile on the streets, | slept with men for money. |\nwas a paedophile's dream\n\nBut it is Andrew’s friendship with Epstein, whom he has known since at least 2000, and with Epstein’s\nconfidante Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late disgraced newspaper baron Robert Maxwell, that\ngives most concern.\n\nHe was first seen with the pair on holiday in Thailand, and was pictured cavorting with Ghislaine at a\nHalloween fetishthemed party in Manhattan.\n\nThe photograph that appeared last weekend shows the prince strolling through Central Park with 58-\nyear-old Epstein. Andrew was said to have spent four days at his New York mansion in December, when\nhe was joined by other distinguished guests, including Woody Allen, at a dinner.\n\nIt is by no means the first New York soiree Andrew has attended as Epstein’s guest.\n\nA lengthy profile of the financier in Vanity Fair magazine some years ago reported that Andrew was a\nguest at a cocktail party thrown by Epstein and Maxwell packed with young Russian models. ‘Some\nguests were horrified,’ said the article’s author, Vicky Ward.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that Epstein is a registered sex offender after recently completing his sentence\nfor offences relating to child prostitution.\n\nHowever, he avoided trial on more serious charges that carried a potential life sentence. And no one\nreading The Mail on Sunday’s interview with the woman who was prepared to testify against him can be\nin any doubt of the seriousness of the charges.\n\nEpstein, a Wall Street money manager who once counted Bill Clinton and Donald Trump among his\nfriends, became the subject of an undercover investigation in 2005 after the stepmother of a 14-year old\ngirl claimed she was paid $200 (£125) to give him an ‘erotic massage’.\n\nThe subsequent FBI probe uncovered at least 20 girls levelling sexual allegations against him.\n\nEventually, Epstein struck a ‘plea bargain’ with prosecutors — a practice not permitted under British law —\nunder which he was allowed to plead guilty to two relatively minor charges.\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1361039/Prince-Andrew-girl-17-sex-offender-frie... 3/16/2011\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021699 |\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Thisissueis one that could slip into the next\nCongress if negotiators are unable to reach an agreement\ngiven the limited time available.\n\nAnother outstanding year-end issue for Congressional\nleaders is whether to address the pending Medicare Part-\nB premium increases facing new and some existing\nMedicare enrollees caused by a smaller annual Social\nSecurity cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). Congress has\nacted in the past to avert premium increases due to\nmodest COLA adjustments before the premium increases\ntake effect. Additional Medicare changes that are\nbipartisan in nature could be added to this Part B\nadjustment if leaders agree to move forward. Up for\npotential consideration are a handful of Medicare-related\nbills that have already passed the House or Senatein the\n114‘ Congress, as well as a package of provisions\nrecently unveiled by the Finance Committee that would\naddress how chronic conditions are managed in the\nMedicare population.\n\nAdditionally, Congress continuesto contemplate action in\nthe lame duck session to address the Obama\nAdministration’s proposal to modify the payment\nmechanisms for Part B Medicare drugs. While the\nproposal has not yet been finalized, concerns about the\nsize and scope of the proposal have been raised by\nCongress.\n\nEnergy. House and Senate conferees also hope to finish\nnegotiating the final version of the bipartisan, omnibus\nEnergy Policy Modernization Act (S. 2012, H.R. 8).\nAmong many other provisions, that bill would give the\nEnergy Department emergency authority to protect the\nelectric power grid from physical and cyber threats;\nrequire the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n(FERC) to expedite consideration of pipeline siting\napplications; ease procedures for mining certain minerals\non federal lands; increase water allocationsto address\ndrought in California; and change forestry management.\n\nThere will also be a push to complete the Water Resources\nDevelopment Act (WRDA). In September, both the Senate\n(S. 2848) and House (H.R. 5303) overwhelmingly passed\nbills that need to be reconciled, but the two chambers\nhave not yet formally gone to conference. One factor that\nis likely to expedite a conference and floor votes is the fact\nthat in September, in order to resolve a deadlock over\ngovernment funding, Speaker Ryan made a commitment\nto move assistance to Flint, Michigan (which has faced a\ndrinking-water crisis) as part of the WRDA bill.\n\nEnergy measures could also come up as Republican\n“riders” on a year-end spending bill, such as provisions\nblocking the EPA’s Clean Power Plan or the “Waters of the\nU.S.” wetlands rule. House Majority Leader McCarthy has\nalso said the House will consider a bill offering a tax credit\nfor new nuclear reactors.\n\nFinancial Services. House Financial Services Chairman\nJeb Hensarling (R-TX) has said he hopes for a lame-duck\nfloor vote on his CHOICE Act, which would repeal much of\nthe Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with a system in which\nbanks would become exempt from many prudential rules if\nthey agree to a much higher leverage ratio. The committee\npassed the CHOICE Act ona party-line vote in September.\nThe Wells Fargo scandal could pose a hurdle for that plan,\nbecause Hensarling’s bill would repeal the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) new rules limiting the\nuse of mandatory arbitration clauses in bank contracts.\nWells Fargo has been criticized for requiring its account\nholders to agree to such clauses, restricting their ability to\nsue the bank after as many as 2 million unauthorized\naccounts were discovered.\n\nThe Financial Services Committee will hold a second\nhearing on November 30 on the Wells Fargo issue, with\nCFPB Director Richard Cordray testifying.

Designed, too, for \nMiddle and High School teachers, The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky will draw English Language \nArts instruction into dialogue with science, and will include extraordinary footage of the natural  \nworld, conversations with poets, scholars, and scientists as well as footage shot in class and in the \nfield with great teachers. \n• A recent partnership with Greenwich Country Day School and the Success Academy Network \nof charter schools will provide a base for the production of a new collection of classroom-ready \neducational material on The Poetry of Art Sport, and Play. This collection will include discussions \non poems filmed everywhere from sports fields to Broadway theaters, and will feature dancers, \nathletes, fashion designers, and more. \n• With a growing archive of footage capturing teachers and students reading American poems, \nwe are eager to expand our reach and move into America's schools, disseminating, testing, \nand learning from teachers and students using our materials. We hope to be able to begin work \nevaluating the impact of poetry on literacy levels and character development and, eventually, to \nproduce a full suite of materials that foster character development along with intellectual growth. \nWorking closely with such partners as The Nantucket Project, Nautilus Magazine, The Aspen Ideas \nFestival, and The Big Think, and, of course, HarvardX, Harvard's provider of free open online \ncourses, we are continuing to create rich educational media on poetry for adult learners and \nlifelong learners. These materials include short form videos such as this one on Robert Pinsky's  \n\"Shirt\" (as featured in The New Yorker), and, this spring, the sixth module of the free seven-part \nPoetry in America MOOC, which has registrants in over 150 countries. \nGrowing rapidly, and outpacing our current staff and infrastructure, Poetry in America has a \nfundraising goal this year of 2.5 million dollars to fund its expanding group of projects. We've taken \na big step, hiring the design agency Threespot to help us develop our web presence. Our \nwebsite— to launch early 2016— will eventually serve as an online hub for our TV show and \neducational projects. We hope you'll join us then for a virtual launch! \nFinally, Jeffrey, you have been such a wonderful supporter of my Poetry in America project. The \nLeon Black gift changed everything for me last year. It paid salaries for staff I desperately needed to \ncomplete projects (detail below), but first and foremost, it gave me leverage, enabling me to set \ndown a solid Harvard base for my activities by giving the school something to point to: this public \nhumanities project among the list of projects the Dean supports. The money did it: as soon as they \nheard about the gift, they took my project more seriously. Because of that gift, the Faculty of Arts \nand Sciences, which is space-stingy, found and rewired a studio space for me to house my video \nproduction operation and team. That gift woke up the Deans to the importance of Harvard's role in \nproducing the highest quality humanities content for the WORLD, and not just for Harvard students. \nMy main employee has half of her salary paid with these funds, and the foundation of our collection \nfor PBS LeamingMedia is being made with this support. This gift represented one of the most \nconsequential shifts of the last year, allowing me create content and launch projects this year that \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028947 \nmake future projects that much more likely. If I can keep this base sturdy at Harvard, refilling these \ncoffers, I will be that much more able to keep working. \nI am also so grateful for the help you gave me in defining my project for Templeton, and, what help \nyou have offered to give in bringing them around. I have, since Templeton turned me down, gotten \nfunding to produce video on two of the poems I'd proposed to Templeton and to create, and test, \nthat video in schools as I proposed. One of my partners in that project is Success Academy, where I \ncould also expand my work with Templeton. And there are still other poems that may satisfy their \ncharacter criteria more fully, including the third of the poems I'd originally proposed and that Joe \nBiden had agreed to discuss with me (on parenthood and humility). At this point, I'm gaining the \nplatform and the name recognition to be an effective spokesperson for the foundation on building \nliteracy and character in the schools. \nIt really means a lot to me, all financial help aside, Jeffrey, that you are rooting for me and thinking \nabout me. You push back a lot (as Larry does), and it's always annoying but I always learn. \nWith abundant gratitude, \nLisa \nElisa New \nPowell M.

It was as if we’d never been there at all.\n\nYet there were the errors, setbacks and frustrations as well. Many months\ninto our planning, we conducted a series of run-throughs in which we simulated\nattaching the intercept to Israel’s telephone network in the south, not far from\nthe camp where I’d done my fironut. Though it all seemed to go as planned, the\nnext morning in rained heavily. Within hours, the phone company was getting\nreports from all around southern Israel of phones malfunctioning. Even\nallowing for the fact it rained less in the Sinai, we had to address the risk. I went\nto see the people in Meir Amit’s technology unit, and they began developing a\nwaterproofing system for the equipment.\n\nThe main problem with the equipment, however, was its sheer weight. The\nhelicopter could get us, and it, into Egypt. But we couldn’t fly directly to the\ncable site in the Sinai. We might just as well tell the Egyptians we were on our\nway. At around 1,100 pounds, it was much too heavy for us to carry. And if we\nwere going to go ahead with the mission, time was running short. A date for the\noperation had been set by the kirya: February 1964. I was not alone in believing\nthat, unless we cracked the problem of getting the equipment to the cable site,\nthe operation was impossible.\n\nThe solution came from a staff officer in military intelligence. Meir Amit\nvisited our base once a month to hear how the preparations were going. With the\ndate getting closer, he brought along his entire staff. When I raised my concern\nabout the weight problem, a colonel from his personnel section said: “Why not\nbuild a lightweight rickshaw, small enough to get in the door of the helicopter,\nbut which can carry all or most of the equipment once you’re on the ground?”\nWithin days, they had a prototype, made of airline-standard tubing and designed\nto be pulled by two men. We held an exercise in the Negev. But it was almost\nimpossible for two men to pull through the sand. It also left deep zig-zag\nimprints in the sand, which would surely raise the suspicions of the Egyptians.\n\nBut prototype number-two was a four-wheel, chrome alloy cart. The\ntechnology experts had made the axles telescopic, so the vehicle would get\nthrough the door of the chopper but could be expanded to the width of an\nEgyptian army Jeep. They had borrowed nose wheels from a training jet. To\ncomplete their oeuvre, they glued on real tire tread from one of the Egyptian\nJeeps we had captured in the 1956 war.\n\na\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011548\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Even the poorest of countries have managed to expand their economies for several years--only for\n\ngrowth to falter.\n\nBerg and Ostry found that income inequality is the single most important factor in determining which countries can\nsustain economic growth. Using the GINI coefficient--which ranges from 0 to 1.0--they measured the extent to which\neconomic growth falls as inequality rises. A country in which everyone earns exactly the same would have a score of 0,\nwhile a society in which one person owned everything would have a score of 1.0. Berg and Ostry saw that a GINI\ncoefficient of higher than 0.45 could weigh on growth. Although correlation is not causation, we note that, based on\nafter-tax income, the U.S. economy scored 0.434 on the GINI scale in 2010, according to the CBO, placing it near that\nthreshold (53).\n\nTo be sure, it seems counterintuitive that inequality is associated with less-sustainable growth, since some inequality,\nby providing incentives to effort and entrepreneurship, may be essential to a functioning market economy. But beyond\nthe risk that inequality may heighten the susceptibility of an economy to booms and busts, it may also spur political\ninstability--thus discouraging investment. Inequality may make it harder for governments to enact policies to\nprevent--or soften--shocks, such as raising taxes or cutting public spending to avoid a debt crisis. The affluent may\nexercise disproportionate influence on the political process, or the needs of the less affluent may grow so severe as to\n\nmake additional cuts to fiscal stabilizers that operate automatically in a downturn politically unviable.\n\nStriking A Palatable Balance\n\nThe discussion about income inequality is hardly new, and contrary opinions abound. In his influential 1975 book\n\"Equality and Efficiency: The Big Tradeoff,\" economist Arthur Okun argued that pursuing equality can reduce\nefficiency. He claimed that not only would more equal income distribution reduce work and investment incentives, but\n\nthe efforts to redistribute wealth--through, for example, taxes and minimum wages--can themselves be costly (54).\n\nOf course, income inequality in the U.S. was much less 40 years ago. Kristin Forbes found that, in the short- and\nmedium-terms over a few years, an increase in income inequality has a significant positive relationship with economic\nexpansion (55). But Forbes also found that the relationship was weakened (or could turn negative) when she increased\nthe length of the growth spells. And a World Bank study later found that the positive effect on growth was almost\n\nexclusively reserved for the top end of the income distribution (56).\n\nIncome inequality can contribute to economic growth, and a degree of inequality is a necessary part of what keeps any\nmarket economic engine operating on all cylinders. Indeed, a degree of inequality is to be expected in any market\neconomy, given differences in \"initial endowments\" (of wealth and ability), the differential market returns to\n\ninvestments in human capital and entrepreneurial activities, and the effect of luck.\n\nHowever, too much of the focus in the debate about inequality has been on the top earners, rather than on how to lift a\nsignificant portion of the population out of poverty--which would be a good thing for the economy. And though\nextreme inequality can impair economic growth, badly designed and implemented efforts to reverse this trend could\n\nalso undermine growth, hurting the very people such policies are meant to help (57).\n\nWWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT AUGUST 5, 2014 19\n\n1351366 | 302136118\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025781\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Nowadays the “C” word does not always sit well with\njournalists, who commonly employ it in conjunction with “theory” to describe paranoid distortions of reality.\n\nEven so, a criminal conspiracy is not a rare phenomenon. Not only was a foreign conspiracy responsible for the\nmonstrous 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center (as well as the previous attempt to blow it up in 1993) but,\naccording to the Center on Law and Security at Fordham University, over 90% of routine federal indictments\nfor terrorist attacks since 9/11 contain at least one conspiracy charge. The government’s pursuit of conspiracies\nis by no means limited to terrorism. Conspiracy charges are the rule rather than the exception in cases brought\nagainst businessmen accused of fixing prices, evading environmental regulations, using insider information or\nlaundering money.\n\nBut there are also pseudo-conspiracies that exist only in a delusionary or misinformed mind. And some of\nthem achieve a huge following. In Pakistan, according to public opinion polls, a majority of the population\nbelieves that the 9/11 attack was staged by President George W. Bush to launch a war on Islam. The claim that\nthe 1969 moon landing was faked is still around. Just two days ago a crew from a Russian TV channel rushed\nto my apartment to interview me about a viral post on YouTube in which the deceased director Stanley\nKubrick supposedly made a deathbed confession to having filmed the landing in a Hollywood studio—even\nthough everything about the post, including a fake Kubrick, was untrue.\n\nWhy people believe in pseudo-conspiracies is the focus of Rob Brotherton’s fascinating book “Suspicious\nMinds.” Mr. Brotherton, an academic psychologist, advances the thesis that the belief in pseudo-conspiracies\nproceeds from the “quirks and foibles” in the way that the human brain, or at least some human brains, process\nevidence. He lucidly reviews studies showing common defects in the brain’s wiring, such as the bias that\nselects evidence to confirm rather than undermine a pre-adopted thesis. “We seek what we expect to find,” as\nMr. Brotherton puts it. Relatedly, “biased assimilation” causes us to “interpret ambiguous events in light of\nwhat we already believe.”\n\nDiscussing Richard Hofstadter’s 1964 essay “The Paranoid Style in American Politics,” Mr. Brotherton\naccepts Hofstadter’s characterization of proponents of politically motivated conspiracy theories as “paranoid”\nand suffering from “‘a psychic phenomenon” that prevents them from seeing the absurdity of their position. But\nhe disagrees with Hofstadter that this condition affects only a small number of people on the fringes of society.\nFor Mr. Brotherton, “conspiracy theories thrive in the mainstream.”\n\nUntil the controversy over the validity of Warren Commission’s 1966 report on the Kennedy assassination, the\nphrase “conspiracy theory” had a more neutral meaning, suggesting a plausible yet unproven claim about\nmultiple actors in a single event. Only in the aftermath of the Warren Commission did it become a derogatory\nterm used to suggest theories that subvert conventional wisdom. To those who doubted the commission’s\nfinding that a single gunman killed Kennedy, Earl Warren became, Mr. Brotherton’s says, the “figurehead in a\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031607\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

[Note: bank\nparticipation in the Latin Brady bond era was high, since at the time, banks held almost all the paper, and in the form of\nilliquid loans].\n\nThe big question: would Germany still live up to the deal if Greece missed deficit targets or assets sales, if bank\nparticipation was too low, or if hedge funds (once referred to by the Chairman of the German Social Democratic Party as\na “swarm of locusts’) reaped large free rider windfalls? Ultimately, this is a political question. If “yes”, Germany will\nunderwrite Greece no matter what; if “no”, then a broader, coercive Greek restructuring might follow in the not-so-distant\nfuture.\n\nIn addition to execution risk in Greece, we are left with 3 other concerns. The current EU-IMF lending facility\ncapacity is Eur 255 bn, but we anticipate that as agreed, national parliaments will expand it to 440 bn. First concern:\nwhile that’s to deal with problems in Greece, Portugal and Ireland, if you include Spain, it gets tight (note: the chart\nexcludes costs to recapitalize banks). If Italy or Belgium entered Europe’s Liquidity Hospital, a lot more money might be\nneeded from European parliaments (in one worst-case scenario, Alliance Bernstein estimates that the EU lending facility\nwould have to increase from 440 bn to 1.7 trillion Euros, mostly from Germany). Italy faces a multi-notch downgrade\nfrom Moody’s, which is not going to help. As we discussed two weeks ago, Italy has been a model citizen in terms of\nrunning low budget deficits for 20 years, but still cannot escape the confines of its very large existing debt stock (120% of\nGDP).\n\nSecond, as shown below, Europe is now a two-speed economy, with the periphery stuck in neutral (industrial production\nis one proxy for this; there are others, such as unemployment, consumption, export shares, etc). If the idea behind the\nEU/IMF effort is that austerity will boost growth and lead these countries back to the public markets, there is very little\nmomentum in this direction. If the status quo in the periphery does not change, all the EU package does is allow the\ncurrent approach more time to fail.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031161\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Our meetings were now no more than five minutes long.\n\nFrom this moment forward, resolve to keep those around you focused and avoid all meetings, whether\nin person or remote, that do not have clear objectives. It is possible to do this tactfully, but expect that\nsome time wasters will be offended the first few times their advances are rejected. Once it is clear that\nremaining on task is your policy and not subject to change, they will accept it and move on with life.\nHard feelings pass. Don’t suffer fools or you'll become one.\n\nIt is your job to train those around you to be effective and efficient. No one else will do it for you.\nHere are a few recommendations:\n\n1. Decide that, given the non-urgent nature of most issues, you will steer people toward the following\nmeans of communication, in order of preference: e-mail, phone, and in-person meetings. If someone\nproposes a meeting, request an e-mail instead and then use the phone as your fallback offer if need be.\nCite other immediately pending work tasks as the reason.\n\n2. Respond to voicemail via e-mail whenever possible. This trains people to be concise. Help them\ndevelop the habit.\n\nSimilar to our opening greeting on the phone, e-mail communication should be streamlined to prevent\nneedless back-and-forth. Thus, an e-mail with “Can you meet at 4:00 P.M.?” would become “Can you\nmeet at 4:00 P.M.? If so If not, please advise three other times that work for you.”\n\nThis “if ... then” structure becomes more important as you check e-mail less often. Since I only check\ne-mail once a week, it is critical that no one needs a “what if?” answered or other information within\nseven days of a given e-mail I send. If I suspect that a manufacturing order hasn’t arrived at the shipping\nfacility, for example, [Il send an e-mail to my shipping facility manager along these lines: “Dear Susan\n... Has the new manufacturing shipment arrived? If so, please advise me on ... If not, please contact John\nDoe at 555-5555 or via e-mail at john@doe.com (he is also CC’d) and advise on delivery date and\ntracking. John, if there are any issues with the shipment, please coordinate with Susan, reachable at 555—\n4444, who has the authority to make decisions up to $500 on my behalf. In case of emergency, call me\non my cell phone, but I trust you two. Thanks.” This prevents most follow-up questions, avoids two\nseparate dialogues, and takes me out of the problem-solving equation.\n\nGet into the habit of considering what “if ... then” actions can be proposed in any e-mail where you\nask a question.\n\n3. Meetings should only be held to make decisions about a predefined situation, not to define the\nproblem. If someone proposes that you meet with them or “set a time to talk on the phone,” ask that\nperson to send you an e-mail with an agenda to define the purpose:\n\nThat sounds doable. So I can best prepare, can you please send me an e-mail with an agenda? That is,\nthe topics and questions we’ll need to address? That would be great. Thanks in advance.\n\nDon’t give them a chance to bail out. The “thanks in advance” before a retort increases your chances\nof getting the e-mail.\n\nThe e-mail medium forces people to define the desired outcome of a meeting or call. Nine times out\nof ten, a meeting is unnecessary and you can answer the questions, once defined, via e-mail. Impose this\nhabit on others. I haven’t had an in-person meeting for my business in more than five years and have had\nfewer than a dozen conference calls, all lasting less than 30 minutes.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013859\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Because I'm not a BDSMer! Because BDSM is dirty.\"\n\nBut we shouldn't necessarily blame people for this instinct to reject and categorize: the\ninstinct is one that comes from being scared and oppressed... because the social penalties\nfor \"getting it wrong” are high. Remember, those New York City dominatrixes thought\nthey were \"safe\" from the law as long as BDSM didn't count as sex. But as soon as\nsomeone decided BDSM \"counted as\" sex, those dominatrixes were arrested.\n\nIt's just one more example of how sexual stigma for \"different kinds of sex\" is constantly\nintertwined. No type of consensual sexuality can express itself freely until people agree\nthat \"among consenting adults, there is no 'should’.\" The Romans, those ancient\nimperialists, used to say: \"Divide and conquer.\" When consensual sexualities are scared\nof each other, we will continue to be conquered. As long as \"vanilla\" people are afraid\nof \"BDSM\"... as long as \"BDSMers\" are afraid of being seen as \"sexual\"... as long\nas the social penalties for being a \"slut\" or a \"whore\" are incredibly steep... as long\nas sex workers are stigmatized and criminalized... everyone will be bound by these\noppressive standards.\n\nKOK ok\n\nThe Embodied Side of BDSM versus Sex\n\nAlthough Part 1 was all about how the divide between \"BDSM\" and \"sex\" is often\nnonsensical, or purely political, or socially constructed... that doesn't mean that the\ndivide does not exist. I once had a conversation about ignoring social constructs with a\nwise friend, who noted dryly that: \"One-way streets are a social construct. That doesn't\nmean we should ignore them.\" Just because the outside world influences our sexuality,\ndoes not mean that our sexual preferences are invalid.\n\nSome polyamorous BDSMers have very different rules about having sex with outsiders,\nas opposed to doing BDSM with outsiders. For example, during the time when I was\nconsidering a transition to polyamory, I myself had a couple relationships where we were\nsexually monogamous -- yet my partners agreed that I could do BDSM with people who\nweren't my partner. Those particular partners felt jealous and threatened by the idea\nof me having sex with another man, but they didn't mind if I did BDSM with\nanother man. Maybe the feelings of those partners only arose because they categorized\n\"BDSM\" and \"sex\" into weirdly different socially-constructed ways... but those\npartners' feelings were nonetheless real, and their feelings deserved respect.\n\nAnd there are also unmistakable ways that BDSM feels different from sex. There is\nsomething, bodily, that is just plain different about BDSM, as opposed to sex. I often\nfind myself thinking of \"BDSM feelings\" and \"sexual feelings\" as flowing down two\nparallel channels in my head... sometimes these channels intersect, but sometimes they're\nfar apart. The BDSM urge strikes me as deeply different, separate, from the sex urge. It\ncan be fun to combine BDSM and sex, but there are definitely times when I want BDSM\nthat feel very unlike most times when I want sex.\n\nThe biggest political reason why it's difficult to discuss this is the way in which we\ncurrently conceptualize sexuality through \"orientations\": we have built a cultural\n“orientation model\" focused on the idea that \"acceptable\" sexuality is \"built-in,\" or\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018539\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Until recently, it was a charter member. But in recent\nyears some of its branches have gotten soft on the First Amendment when it comes to racist,\nsexist and homophobic speech on college campuses.

Mr. Dershowitz Has No “Evidence” of Perjury And Instead Is Simply Trying To\nBully This Victim\n\nAs explained above, Defendant Dershowitz wrongly suggests to this Court that non-party\n\nVirginia Giuffre has committed perjury in an effort to taint the Court against this victim. His only\n\n“evidence” of this alleged perjury is a self-serving opinion from his retained expert that an\n\n“absence of records” in response to a FOJA request, establishes that former President Clinton was\n\nnever on Jeffrey Epstein’s island in the USVI. Defendant Dershowitz misrepresents the\n\ngovernment’s response. The government is only required to conduct a reasonable search of\n\nreadily accessible records. Accordingly, an “absence of records” response does not mean that\n\nrecords do not exist. It simply means that in the course of the search, no records were found. See\n\nCunningham v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 961 F.Supp. 2d 226, 236 (D.C. 2013) (court reasoning that\n\n“t]he adequacy of a search is measured by a standard of reasonableness...

Since the fall of the Soviet Union, hundreds of\nthousands of Russians had also flowed into Israel. Most were Jewish in culture\nmore than religious observance, but they were instinctively inclined to support\ncandidates — Rabin in 1992, and Bibi the last time around — who they felt were\nlikely to take a tough line in any peace negotiations with the Arabs.\n\nI was never going to get the backing of many West Bank settlers, or of core\nsupporters of the Likud and parties even further to the right. But I would need to\nmake at least some dent in Bibi’s hold on the Russian voters who had supported\nhim by a wide margin in 1996. I focused first on Yisrael Ba’Aliyah, the main\nRussian immigrant political party. It had been set up by the iconic Soviet-era\nrefusenik Natan Sharansky — or, as he was then known, Anatoly Sharansky. He’d\nbeen an ally of Andrei Sakharov, an outspoken human rights advocate and, until he\nwas finally released and allowed to leave in 1986, a political prisoner in the gulag.\nThough Natan’s party was not going to offer a formal endorsement for any\ncandidate, I met with him to press the case for “security and peace,” the message\nI’d tried to advance with Shimon three years earlier, and to emphasize the need to\nbring unity and shared purpose back to the country. Though I think he would have\nbeen receptive anyway, it didn’t hurt that he, like me, was a mathematics graduate\n— from Moscow’s Physics and Technology Institute. He was also a chess\naficionado. When I was rash enough to face him across the board, as I recall, it\ntook him all of five minutes, and seven moves, to checkmate me.\n\nBut I also made dozens of visits to Russian community groups, and met with\nindividual families whenever I could. Often, I found myself talking to older men\nand women among the immigrants about the military details of the Great Patriotic\nWar, as the Russians called World War Two. On a number of occasions, I accepted\nthe invitation to sit down and play on a sitting-room piano. I think the first time I\ngot a sense that any of this might be having an impact was in a quote from a\nYisrael Ba’Aliyah official in an Israeli newspaper. Though still stopping short of a\nformal endorsement, the official was quoted as saying: “A month ago, young\nRussians thought Barak was a boring, left-wing socialist party leader who doesn’t\nlook good on TV and mumbles a lot... Today, they see him as a high-ranking\nIsraeli general who knows how to play the piano. The Russian immigrants like\nstrong, cultured people.” Except for the bit about mumbling, I couldn’t have\nwished for more.\n\n313\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028161\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

As of now it looks \nlike former Chairman of Armed Services, Congressman Ron Dellums, will be the author. Please keep highly \nconfidential. Will keep you posted on if, when and where it gets published. Once it is published we can all circulate it \nhighly. We believe that this article sets the tone for the advocacy we will be doing and having someone very prominent \nlike Congressman Dellums will also be a great way to launch this campaign. \nCongressman Ronald Dellums is a thirteen term Member of the U.S. House of Representatives (D-CA) who \nserved from 1971-1998. He also served as the 48th Mayor of Oakland from 2007-2011. Dellums served as the \nChairman of the House Armed Services Committee and the House Committee on the District of Columbia. He \nalso served on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, the Permanent \nSelect Committee on Intelligence and co-founded the Congressional Black Caucus. \nSenegal's Democratic Backslide \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028776 \n2015 was a banner year for democracy in Africa. Nigeria, the largest country on the continent, had a \ndemocratic election, and even more impressively, had its first ever peaceful transition of power when sitting \nPresident Goodluck Jonathan transferred power to Muhammadu Buhari. Former President Jonathan conceded \nand famously declared, \"Nobody's ambition is worth the blood of any Nigerian.\" My last piece for The Hill \nwas titled, 'Will Guinea's experiment in democracy succeed?\" It is with great joy that I can report that it \ndid! Guinea's first democratically elected President, Alpha Conde, won his reelection campaign in a peaceful \nelection that was internationally monitored in which the Guinean electorate reaffirmed its commitment to a \ndemocracy. \nDespite these victories for democracy in a continent in which I dedicated a great deal of my life's work, I am \ndeeply troubled by developments over the last few weeks. Earlier this week Uganda President Yoweri \nMuseveni extended his thirty year rule and \"won\" his fifth consecutive election which international observers \nsaid was marred with intimidation and impropriety. Shortly after the election Museveni, who scrapped \nconstitutional term limits a decade ago, had his political rival, Kizza Besigye arrested and detained for \nprotesting the election results. Of course we have come to expect these actions from Museveni in \nUganda. What I am even most troubled by is what is taking place in Senegal, which was once the pillar of \ndemocracy in Africa. \nWhen Abdoulaye Wade was democratically elected as President of Senegal in 2000, it was a huge step \nforward for democracy in Africa. President Wade adopted a new constitution and instituted term limits for the \nfirst time in Senegalese history. In 2012 President Wade was defeated in a democratic election by his Prime \nMinister Macky Sall. The United States and the larger international community praised Wade for his quick \nconcession and praised peaceful transition of power. President Macky Sall affirmed his commitment to \ndemocracy announcing that he would shorten term limits from 7 to 5 years. President Obama visited Senegal in \nJune of 2013 and praised President Sall for his commitment to democracy in shortening the presidential \nmandate and praised the country's rule of law. \nUnfortunately in the past few years much has changed and we are witnessing a backslide in what was once \nAfrica's brightest democratic success story. When the opposition party, the Senegalese Democratic Party, \ndesignated former President Abdoulaye Wade' son, former Minister Karim Wade, as their candidate for the next \npresidential election; President Sall had Karim Wade arrested and detained. President Macky Sall then \nreestablished a special court by presidential decree that had been abolished by Senegalese law and not heard a \ncase in thirty years. This newly established special court sentenced Mr. Wade to six years in prison. He remains \nin prison today, sentenced without appeal. In April 2015, the United Nations Working Group of Arbitrary \nDetention determined that Mr. Wade was arbitrarily arrested and that his detention was in violation of \ninternational law. Last month the UN Working Group reaffirmed its finding and called on President Sall's \nregime to release Karim Wade and comply with international law. Sall has ignored the UN Working Groups \nrequest. \nLast week the backslide continued even further as President Macky Sall reneged on his commitment to shorten \nterm limits. Instead of holding elections next year, after five years per his commitment, he announced that he \nwould serve until 2019. He claims that this decision was based on the opinion - just an opinion - of the \nConstitutional Council that he had himself sought. \nIn light of the trend toward democracy in Africa as exemplified by Nigeria and Guinea, it is very concerning \nthat one of the United States' closest allies and Africa's strongest democracies appears to be retrogressing. The \ndestabilization of democracy in Senegal could have significant consequences in the entire region. The United \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028777 \nStates must get in front of this negative trend before spreads across Africa and it is too late. The U.S. should \ncall for President Sall to honor the request of the UN Working Group and release his political rival Mr. Wade \nand also keep his pledge of a 5 year presidential mandate. President Obama has said that Africa is more \nimportant than ever to security and prosperity in the U.S. We have worked very hard in implementing and \nprioritizing democracy and democratic succession in Africa. The Obama administration must not let our hard \nwork be compromised in Senegal, we have worked too hard and come too far. \n<image001.gif> \nVinoda Basnayake \nOf Counsel and Chair of DC Government Relations \nNelson Mullins Riley a Scarborough LLP \n101 Constitution Avenue, NW, Suite 900 \nWashington, DC 20001 \nTel: \nFax: \nwww.nelsonmullins.com  \n(View Bio) \nFrom: elisabeth feliho [mailto: \nSent: Tuesday, February 23, 2016 5:20 AM \nTo: Vinoda Basnayake; Bob Crowe \nCc: Cheikh Tidiane Sy; Mohamed Seydou Diagne; El Hadji Amadou Sall \nSubject: Revised letter.

Okay. So you would agree with me then, that\nthe fact that a person often visited the mansion, the\nperson -- the fact that a person was a friend of\nMr. Epstein for 15 years, the fact that the person had\nstated publicly that: \"Mr. Epstein liked young women\nalmost as much as I do myself,” and the fact that the\nname is circled in the address book is not sufficient to\nraise a Suspicion that that person engaged in sexual\nmisconduct?\n\nA.

SCAROLA: You're not required to answer\nyes or no, if a yes or no response alone would be\nmisleading.\n\nTHE WITNESS: The problem is the word\n\"suspicion.\" I'm not particularly suspicious on\nthose facts, but it -- you know, what do you mean\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n249\nby \"suspicion\"? If 1 -- if I were running an FBI\ninvestigation and somebody circled a name as --\nas saying, look, this fellow may have some\ninformation, I'd go follow up on that.\n\nIf you say that's suspicion, then the answer\nwould be, yes.

If\nanything, such behavior suggests an attempt to entice and potentially embarrass Mr. Trump by\n\ndangling the prospect of compromising information and getting his aides to jump at it.\n\nGiven the paucity of evidence, it’s staggering that the FBI would initiate a counterintelligence\ninvestigation, led by politically biased staff, amid a presidential campaign. The aggressive methods and\nsubsequent leaking only strengthen that conclusion. If the FBI sincerely believed Trump associates\nwere Russian targets or agents, the proper response would have been to inform Mr. Trump so that he\n\ncould protect his campaign and the country.\n\nMr. Trump’s critics argue that the claim of political bias is belied by the fact that Crossfire was not\nleaked before the election. In fact, there were vigorous, successful pre-election efforts to publicize the\nTrump-Russia collusion narrative. Shortly after Crossfire’s launch, CIA Director John Brennan and Mr.\nComey briefed Congress, triggering predictable leaking. Christopher Steele and his patrons embarked\n\non a media roadshow, making their dossier something of an open secret in Washington.\n\nOn Aug. 29, 2016, the New York Times published a letter to Mr. Comey from Senate Minority Leader\nHarry Reid, saying he’d learned of “evidence of a direct connection between the Russian government\nand Donald Trump’s presidential campaign,” which had “employed a number of individuals with\nsignificant and disturbing ties to Russia and the Kremlin.” On Aug. 30, the ranking Democratic\nmembers of four House committees wrote a public letter to Mr. Comey requesting “that the FBI assess\nwhether connections between Trump campaign officials and Russian interests” may have contributed\nto the DNC hack so as “to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.” On Sept. 23, Yahoo News’s\nMichael Isikoff reported the Hill briefings and the Steele dossier’s allegations regarding Carter Page.\nOn Oct. 30, Harry Reid again publicly wrote Mr. Comey: “In my communications with you and other\ntop officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive\ninformation about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian\n\ngovernment.”\n\nThat these leaking efforts failed to prevent Mr. Trump’s victory, or that Mr. Comey’s ham-fisted\ninterventions might have also hurt Mrs. Clinton’s electoral prospects, does not diminish the legal\n\nsignificance of the anti-Trump bias shown by government officials.\n\nThe totality of the circumstances creates the appearance that Crossfire was politically motivated. Since\nan attempt by federal law enforcement to influence a presidential election “shocks the conscience,” any\n\nprosecutorial effort derived from such an outrageous abuse of power must be suppressed.

If you ask a child in the formal stage to solve this problem, she may pro-\nceed to do a number of experiments, e.g. build a long string with a light weight, a long string\nwith a heavy weight, a short string with a light weight and a short string with a heavy weight.\nThrough these experiments she may determine that a short string leads to a fast swing, a long\nstring leads to a slow swing, and the weight doesn’t matter at all.\n\nThe role of experiments like this, which test “extreme cases,” is to make cognition easier. The\nformal-stage mind tries to map a concrete situation onto a maximally simple and manipulable\nset of abstract propositions, and then reason based on these. Doing this, however, requires an\nautomated and instinctive understanding of the reasoning process itself. The above-described\nexperiments are good ones for solving the pendulum problem because they provide data that\nis very easy to reason about. From the perspective of uncertain inference systems, this is the\nkey characteristic of the formal stage: formal cognition approaches problems in a way explicitly\ncalculated to yield tractable inferences.\n\nNote that this is quite different from saying that formal cognition involves abstractions and\nadvanced logic. In an uncertain logic-based AGI system, even infantile cognition may involve\nthese — the difference lies in the level of inference control, which in the infantile stage is simplistic\nand hard-wired, but in the formal stage is based on an understanding of what sorts of inputs\nlead to tractable inference in a given context.\n\n11.4.4 The Reflexive Stage\n\nIn the reflexive stage (Figure 11.8), an intelligent agent is broadly capable of selfmodifying its\ninternal structures and dynamics.\n\nAs an example in the human domain: highly intelligent and self-aware adult humans may\ncarry out reflexive cognition by explicitly reflecting upon their own inference processes and\ntrying to improve them. An example is the intelligent improvement of uncertain-truth-value-\nmanipulation formulas. It is well demonstrated that even educated humans typically make\nnumerous errors in probabilistic reasoning [GGIK02]. Most people don’t realize it and continue\nto systematically make these errors throughout their lives. However, a small percentage of\nindividuals make an explicit effort to increase their accuracy in making probabilistic judgments\nby consciously endeavoring to internalize the rules of probabilistic inference into their automated\ncognition processes.\n\nIn the uncertain inference based AGI context, what this means is: In the reflexive stage\nan entity is able to include inference control itself as an explicit subject of abstract learning\n(i.e. the ability to reason about one’s own tactical and strategic approach to modifying one’s\nown learning and thinking), and modify these inference control strategies based on analysis of\nexperience with various cognitive approaches.\n\nUltimately, the entity can self-modify its internal cognitive structures. Any knowledge or\nheuristics can be revised, including metatheoretical and metasystemic thought itself. Initially\nthis is done indirectly, but at least in the case of AGI systems it is theoretically possible to\nalso do so directly. This might be considered as a separate stage of Full Self Modification, or\nelse as the end phase of the reflexive stage. In the context of logical reasoning, self modification\nof inference control itself is the primary task in this stage. In terms of inference control this\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013118\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In one reported instance, the private\ninvestigator claimed to be a police officer, and Reiter considered filing witness-tampering charges.\n\nThe credibility of the victims was also an issue; they had never complained of their treatment by Epstein until they\nwere contacted by police, and they may have voluntarily returned to the Palm Beach mansion several times. Many of\nthe girls came from disadvantaged backgrounds or broken homes, and they were susceptible to Epstein’s cash,\nintimidation, and charm. Those who were 16 when they went to El Brillo Way would have been in their 20s by the time\nthey took the stand, and Epstein’s investigators had dredged up every instance of bad behavior in their pasts.\nAccording to an exchange in the Reiter deposition, a few of the victims had worked in West Palm Beach at massage\nparlors known as “jack shacks.” Each new compromising detail was immediately forwarded to the State Attorney's\nOffice, where staff met frequently with Epstein’s lawyers.\n\nThe Florida statutes are clear: Any person older than 24 who engages in sexual contact with someone under the age\n| of 18 commits a felony of the second degree. The victim’s prior sexual conduct is not relevant; ignorance of her age is\n| no defense. She needn't resist physically to cast doubt on the issue of “consent.” For a child under 16, even lewd\nbehavior short of touching is a felony of the second degree. But convincing a jury that a sexual encounter is a heinous\ncrime is difficult if the victim can be made to appear willing and unharmed, not to mention vulgar and mercenary. It\nwasn’t hard to imagine some of the victims quickly being discredited in court by Epstein’s crack legal team, who\nrepeatediy noted that the age of consent is lower in many other states.\n\nBut that doesn’t quite explain why the Department of Justice would forgo the child-trafficking charges, which pertain\nregardless of a girl’s attitude or character. Epstein’s final sentence is so out of line with the statutory guidelines for that\ncrime that it appears the department may have been influenced by the existence of his many powerful friends and\nattorneys. A highly intelligent man who once taught math at the Dalton School in New York without a bachelor’s\ndegree, Epstein has been a serious and respected player in the highest reaches of politics and philanthropy. He has\nmade substantial contributions to political candidates, served on the Council on Foreign Relations, and donated $30\nmillion to Harvard University.\n\nMoreover, many of his high-powered acquaintances availed themselves of Epstein’s private jets, for which the pilot\nlogs, obtained by discovery in the civil suits, sometimes showed that bold-face names were on the same flights as\nunderage girls. A high-profile trial threatened to splash mud over all sorts of big players, just as both Gov. Richardson\nand Bill Clinton’s wife were running for president. Also, a hedge fund prosecution in which Epstein offered to give\nevidence was heating up. Alberto Gonzales, who was U.S. attorney general throughout most of the Epstein\ninvestigation and resigned just before the non-prosecution agreement was signed, told The Daily Beast that he “would\nhave instructed the Justice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.” But that may have been an\nimpossible mandate, given the players involved.\n\nInstead, said attorney Brad Edwards, “Epstein committed crimes that should have jailed him for most of his life...he\nwas jailed for only a few months.” And this week he waiks through his door a free man.\n\nConchita Samoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 500 companies and has produced\nthree current events debate television programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut to Kabul, and a segment for The\nOppenheimer Report.

On certain occasions, a named executive officer or\na named executive officer’s spouse or other family member may fly on the corporate aircraft as additional passengers. No additional direct operating\ncost is incurred in such situations under the foregoing methodology because the costs would not be incremental.

A year later, he succeeded live on the Oprah\nWinfrey show, holding his breath for 17 minutes and 4 seconds.\nBorn in Brooklyn, Blaine discovered his passion for\nmagic at the age of four when he saw a magician perform\nin the subway. His mother encouraged his passion and he\nbegan performing professionally at private parties by the age\nof thirteen. By the age of twenty-three, Blaine had created,\ndirected, and produced an original television program titled\nStreet Magic, which garnered rave reviews by critics and\n\nrevolutionized the way magic is portrayed on television.\nPenn Jillette of Penn & Teller called Street Magic “the best\nTV magic special ever done” and “the biggest breakthrough\nin our lifetime.” The New York Times noted that David has\n“taken a craft that’s been around for hundreds of years\n\nand done something unique and fresh with it.” The New\nYorker claimed that “he saved magic.” Since then, Blaine\nhas produced nine additional primetime specials.\n\nBlaine has performed magic privately for U.S.\nPresidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, Governor\nArnold Schwarzenegger, Bill Gates, Henry Kissinger, Mayor\nBloomberg, Mark Zuckerberg, and Muhammad Ali, as\nwell as President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia and other\ninternational leaders. He also performed alongside Michael\nJackson, and during the Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nIn 2010, Blaine performed magic for 72 hours\nstraight in Times Square, raising nearly $100,000 for\nrelief efforts following the earthquake in Haiti.\n\nBlaine resides in New York City with his\nfiancée, Alizee Guinochet.

Most courts will follow Enmund and reverse felony-murder death sentences.\nBut if the Supremes take your case and reverse or limit Enmund, people will die because of you.\nYou have to go by the numbers.”\n\nI understood his reference to “the numbers” as meaning two different things: First the numbers\non the Supreme Court, which now might be 5-4 against us. And the large number of condemned\ninmates who faced execution on a theory similar to that which had lead the sentencing judge in\nArizona to sentence the Tison brothers to die even though they had not killed the Lyons family or\nintended their death.\n\nI respected the insights and judgments of the callers, but I had two clients on death row. I was\ntheir lawyer, not the lawyer for the many other death row inmates whose fates could be adversely\ndetermined by a negative ruling in our case. I cared deeply about the other inmates. I cared\ndeeply about every inmate facing the death penalty. I cared deeply about the issue itself. But I\ncould not allow these strong feelings to influence my decision regarding my clients. I was the\nonly person between them and the canisters of death that stood ready to end their young lives. At\nthat moment in time, I was not a “capital punishment lawyer” or a “cause” lawyer of any kind. I\nwas Ricky and Raymond Tison’s lawyer. I had to put case before cause, client before campaign,\nthe Tison brothers before the others on death row. It was an excruciating conflict, but not a\ndifficult legal or ethical decision.\n\nI decided to file a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court. Our hope was that the justices\nwould not want to hear full argument on an issue they had so recently considered: namely the\nconstitutionality of the death penalty for defendants—like Enmund—who had not been the actual\ntriggerman in a crime that had resulted in the death of the victim. We hoped the justices would\nsimply “remand the case for reconsideration in light of Enmund.” In other words, that they would\nsend the case back to the Arizona courts so that those judges could apply the Enmund precedent\nto the facts of the Tison case. That would have been the best of all possible worlds. The Court\nwould have reaffirmed Enmund as the binding precedent and sent a strong message to the state\ncourts to be sure to follow that precedent. And it would have saved the lives of Ricky and\nRaymond. But it was not to be. To our disappointment and worry, the justices granted review\nand set the case down for full briefing and argument.\n\nGenerally, lawyers are ecstatic when the High Court grants review of one of their cases. It means\nthat they will have the privilege of arguing before the Supreme Court—a rare honor that few\nlawyers ever experience. It also means they will have an opportunity to influence the\ndevelopment of constitutional law—a knife that cuts both ways, since the influence may be\npositive or negative.\n\nIn this case, I was far from ecstatic, since the granting of review so soon after the divided decision\nin Enmund signaled a desire on the part of at least some of the justices to reconsider and perhaps\n\nreverse or limit Enmund. The last thing I wanted to be was the vehicle by which the justices\n\n170\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017257\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

And we continue to enable the same infiltration elsewhere.\n\nFP: Tell our readers about “The Project” and “Explanatory Memorandum.” These are realities that serve as\ngreat threats to the Control Factor, right?\n\nSiegel: These are separate sets of documents that outline the Muslim Brotherhood’s goals and\n\nplans underlying the Civilization Jihad. The former was discovered in Europe and extends globally. The\n1991 Explanatory Memorandum emerged in 2008 from the Holy Land Foundation trial and describes the\nBrotherhood’s work in America as a “Civilization-Jihadist Process with all the word means” and “a kind of\ngrand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and ‘sabotaging’ its miserable\nhouse by their own hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God’s religion is made\nvictorious over all other religions.”\n\nMuch as the communists of the Soviet Union had formulated in the 1950s a detailed long term plan to\ndestroy America (many of the effects of which we are seeing of late including destroying the nuclear family,\nsecularizing the nation, feminizing men ...) these documents identify many strategies to infiltrate while\neroding the foundations of our civilization in order to transform it into an Islamic one. The Control Factor\nhas many ingenious ways to convince us that this is ridiculous, that our courts and system would never allow\nsuch a thing, that one is racist or “Islamophobic,” if not insane, for even thinking this is real. And just as\nwith the communists, time is plentiful. Even more so with our Islamic Enemy, a multi-decade plan is short\nterm. It is not critical that a seriou sly engaged Muslim lives to see the result. It is critical, more correctly a\nduty, however, that he carries on his Jihad. Patrick Poole and The Center for Security Policy’s Team B\nReport, Shariah: The Threat to America, are excellent sources for your readers to pursue these documents.\n\nFP: And so what you call an “Inner Jihad” has to start. It’s our, as you say, mandatory “addiction treatment.”\nPlease explain.\n\nSiegel: The “Inner Jihad” is the effort we must undertake to gain control over our Control Factors. There is a\nfamous Hadith in which Mohammad, returning from a successful battle, essentially says that the physical\nfight was the “lesser Jihad” and it is time to then attend to the “greater Jihad €”- that internal battle against\nour own internal appetites, lusts, wrong thinking and so forth. While that Hadith has been falsely utilized to\nsay that “Jihad” is not violent, it is useful to us as a symbol of the vicious effort we must take internally\nagainst our own Control Factor tendencies.\n\nAs I said earlier, the Control Factor is “active” and “continuous” so we must constantly monitor and combat\nit. Like “Whack-a-Mole,” just as we may think we have addressed it, another variation pops right up. I use\nthe terms “addict” and “enabler” because we truly need a form of rehab to break the habitual power of the\nControl Factor and because our relationship with our Islamic Enemy is very much like that between a typical\naddict and his enabler. And just as it is so difficult for an addict to kick his habit, so does the enabler act\nessentially addicted to his behavior and find it so difficult to change. At its core, the relati onship involves\nthe transfer of responsibility for our Islamic Enemy’s hate and resultant actions onto us with our response\nframed essentially as an effort to do what we can to try to address the Enemy’s grievance. (Your book,\nUnited in Hate, describes this addiction to hate in detail.\n\nThe key to the Inner Jihad is to learn to transfer responsibility for our Islamic Enemy’s hate and resultant\nactions back to it and take responsibility back for our own situation. We must learn all we can about the\nenemy. We must unwind our inappropriate projections and introjections and rediscover who we are and are\nnot. We must speak up. We must support those Muslims who promote expressions of Islam that are\nconsistent with our principles. And we must stalk the C ontrol Factor, constantly be on guard for its\nintrusion. This is an individual endeavor as each of our Control Factors uses its own methods. The book\ngives plenty of examples of each maneuver discussed but it is important for each of us to discover the unique\nworkings of his own mind. That takes the work of the Inner Jihad.\n\nFP: Share with our readers what you mean by the “Turnaround Moment.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024425\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This was unconventional, but Virginia had no suspicions.\nPresumably, she thought, this was how the wealthy conducted their business.\n\nEpstein elicited the information that Virginia had been a runaway, and was no longer a virgin.\n\nVirginia was then told to start massaging Epstein, under the instructions of the woman who had\nshown her in. The massage quickly developed into a sexual encounter.\n\nVirginia was uncomfortable, but reluctant to deny such important people. ‘My face was red with\nembarrassment,’ she says. ‘But | felt under immense pressure to please them.\n\nThe whole time it was going on, they were promising me the world, that I’d travel with Jeffrey on his\nprivate jet and have a well-paid profession.’ Afterwards, she was given two $100 bills and told to\nreturn the next day.\n\nThat was the beginning of the four years she spent with Epstein.\n\nFor three of those years, she was under Florida’s age of consent, which is 18.\n\nTroubled teenager: Virginia on the billionaire's Zorro ranch in New Mexico in 2001\n\nVirginia was fascinated by his life story: the son of a humble New York City parks worker, he was a\nteacher before becoming a Wall Street broker and friends with the upper echelons of the political,\nfinancial and academic establishment.\n\nAs a confused teenager, Virginia easily fell into the practice of sexually gratifying him for money.\nHe guaranteed her a minimum of $200 each time she gave him what he called an ‘erotic massage.’\n\nVirginia said: ‘| would always receive the money immediately.

It\nwas easy to fall into his grasp.\n\n‘The way it usually worked was I’d be sent to meet a man on the private island Jeffrey owned in the\nCaribbean, or at his ranch in New Mexico, which was really isolated.’ She was ‘given’ to men ranging\nin age from their 40s to their 60s.\n\nThey included a well-known businessman (whose pregnant wife was asleep in the next room), a\nworld-renowned scientist, a respected liberal politician and a foreign head of state.\n\nNone appeared to think the arrangement was unusual. Virginia says there were many other girls in\nEpstein’s circle and that she was paid extra money to help recruit them.\n\n‘They would lounge around the Palm Beach house, the ranch or the island, nude or topless,’ she\nsays. ‘But | was one of the very few he trusted as “special” and chosen to “entertain” his friends.’\n\nVirginia took the sedative Xanax to detach herself from sordid reality. ‘It was an escape drug,’ she\nsays. ‘It made me calm and helped me forget about what | had to do. | was up to eight pills a day.’\n\nEpstein had no objection to Virginia’s use of prescription drugs, no doubt recognising that they made\nher even more malleable. ‘I didn’t want to go back to the life I'd had before’ she says.\n\n‘That made me totally obedient.’ Despite the fact that Epstein was, essentially, her pimp, this life now\nseemed normal to Virginia. ‘I felt that he and Ghislaine really cared for me,’ she said.\n\n> The Hunger Games\nmay have prequels as\nLionsgate promises the\nfranchise ‘will live on\nand on’\n\nLionsgate is exploring the\npossibilities\n\n> 'My funny honey’:\nChristie Brinkley\npromotes her 17-year-\nold daughter Sailor's\nmodeling career with\nsome bikini snaps on\nInstagram\n\nb'She's doing great!':\nKim Kardashian's BFF\nJonathan Cheban gives\nupdate on Saint's\nmother as he gets\ncheeky with bikini-clad\ngirlfriend in Miami\n\n> Jimmy Kimmel makes\nup fake baby names for\nKim and Kanye's son\nduring Lie Witness News\nsegment\n\nSpok in his segment Lie-\nWitness News\n\nb Victoria's Secret Angel\n\nLily Aldridge reveals her 2\n\nhusband doesn't want\ntheir daughter\n‘anywhere near the\nrunway’ but insists she\nwould proud\n\n» Androgynous model\nchallenges Victoria's\nSecret's beauty\nstandards by posing in\nthe brand's lingerie and\nthen editing the faces of\nAngels onto her body\n\n» Hey Baby!

Given our\nassumptions about oil prices, we believe that the\ncash distributions from MLPs are generally secure\nand provide a yield to investors of just over 7%.\nIn the absence of any valuation changes, the yield\ntranslates into a high single-digit tax-advantaged\nreturn. Any growth in cash flow distribution or\nimprovements in valuation relative to the S&P 500\nwould provide some upside.\n\nOverweight Spanish Equities: We maintain an\noverweight to Spanish equities on a currency-\nhedged basis. This tactical tilt was introduced in\nAugust 2013, and we have adjusted the size of\nthe overweight about a dozen times since. Spanish\nequities offer some of the cheapest valuations\nacross the developed markets, attractive dividend\nyields, expected earnings growth of 4.6%, aided\nby healthy domestic growth, and a particularly\nwell-capitalized® banking sector that has a lower\nnonperforming loan ratio than the Eurozone bank\naverage. Furthermore, Spain is unlikely to face the\nsame political uncertainty as Germany, France and\nItaly in 2017. We expect high single-digit returns\nfor Spanish equities.\n\nShort Five-Year German Bunds: We recommend\n\na short position in five-year German bunds as\n\nthe ECB embarks upon the process of shifting\n\nits monetary policy. After the December 2016\nmeeting, the ECB announced that it would reduce\nits monthly purchases of bonds from €80 billion to\n€60 billion starting in March 2017 and continuing\nthrough December 2017. We expect the ECB to\nend all purchases sometime in 2018, barring any\nshocks. As a result, we think interest rates for\nEurozone sovereign debt will rise gradually over\nthe course of the year, which in the case of German\nbunds means they will become less negative. We\nexpect a modest 2% return from this tilt.\n\nShort Chinese Renminbi: We have increased our\nbearish position on the Chinese renminbi over\n\nthe course of 2016. China is under pressure from\nmultiple sides: the need for loose monetary policy\nto achieve the leadership’s 6.5% target GDP\ngrowth rate, 32 months of capital outflows that\nhave accelerated in late 2016, a strong dollar and\nan incoming Trump administration that will likely\n\npursue a US-centric policy toward China. Risks are\nexacerbated by the leadership’s lack of experience\nin handling financial market volatility, as evidenced\nby China’s policy response to its equity market\ncollapse in June 2015 and its approach to shifting\nthe currency regime to a more flexible one in\nAugust 2015 and January 2016. We expect the\ncurrency to depreciate about 7% in 2017; since\n4% is already priced in the forward markets, we\nexpect a return of about 3%. There is considerable\nscope for further upside from this tilt if China\nabandons its current control of the currency,\n\na move that could lead to depreciation in the\nrenminbi of about 20%.\n\nOur tactical tilts are based on above-trend growth\nof 2.3% in the US, global growth of 2.9%,\ngenerally favorable monetary policy and more\nstimulative fiscal policy across developed and\nemerging market countries. We expect returns to\nbe muted across asset classes, resulting in modest\nreturns in a diversified portfolio with a modest\nenhancement from tactical tilts. Of course, our\nviews are not without risks. As we discuss below,\nsome are low-probability risks with the potential\nfor high impact while others are high-probability\nrisks with low impact potential.\n\nThe Risks to Our Outlook\n\nWhen we think about the risks to our economic\nand financial market outlook, we are reminded of\nthe words of French writer Jean-Baptiste Alphonse\nKarr: Plus ca change, plus c’est la méme chose—the\nmore things change, the more they stay the same.\nThis year’s list of risks overlaps with those of the\nlast several years. As far back as 2011, investors\nhave worried about a hard landing in China. From\nthe inception of the European sovereign debt\ncrisis in 2010 through the Brexit vote in 2016, the\npotential breakup of the Eurozone has been a source\nof concern. As soon as the Federal Reserve raised\nthe federal funds rate in December 2015, investors\nworried about tightening policy causing a recession.\nCybersecurity and terrorism are constant threats.\nAnd geopolitical risks have grown over time. This\nyear, we are adding trade policy uncertainty and US-\nChina geopolitical relations as new risks.\n\nAs we said in our 2013 Outlook, there is no\nshortage of concerns as markets climb a wall\nof worry. In our view, there are eight risks that\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 25\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014558\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Nor would that data be forthcoming from Snowden, who\nmay be the only witness to the crime. By June 23, he was in a safe\nhaven in Moscow. Even though the grand jury case against Snowden\nwas cut and dry, it was also irrelevant because the United States does\nnot have an extradition treaty with Russia.\n\nThe purpose of the intelligence investigation went far beyond\ndetermining Snowden’s guilt or innocence, however. Its job was to\nfind out how such a massive theft of documents could occur, how the\nperpetrator escaped, and, perhaps most urgent, who had obtained the\nunaccounted-for stolen documents from Snowden.\n\nIn his interviews with journalists in Moscow, Snowden studiously\navoided describing the means by which he breached the security\naperture of America’s most secret intelligence service. He only told\nthe journalists who came to Moscow to interview him, with a bit of\npseudo-modesty, that he was not “an angel” who descended from\nheaven to carry out the theft. But the question of how Snowden\nstole these documents may be the most important part of the story.\nThe NSA, after all, furnishes communications intelligence to the\n\n© president, his national security advisers, and the Department of ©\nDefense, intelligence that is supposedly derived from secret sources\nin adversary nations. If these adversary nations learn about the\nNSA’s sources, then the information, if not worthless, cannot be\nfully trusted. The most basic responsibility of the NSA is to pro-\ntect its sources. Yet Snowden walked away with long lists of them.\nIn doing so, he amply demonstrated that a single civilian employee\nworking for an outside contractor, even one not having the neces-\nsary passwords and other access privileges, could steal documents\nthat betrayed these vital sources. He also demonstrated that such a\nmassive theft could go undetected for at least two weeks.\n\nIf Snowden managed this feat on his own, as he claims in his\nHong Kong video, it suggests that any other civilian employee with\na perceived grievance against NSA practices or American foreign\npolicy could also walk away with some of the most precious secrets\nheld by U.S. intelligence.

Kindly enlighten us as to these profound\ninsights you make in terms of the Control Factor.\n\nSiegel: First, let’s distinguish the ”real world” where real battles are taking place from the mental battlefield\nwhich occurs in each of our minds. We tend to believe our perceptions are simply clear realizations of what\nis “out there” and overlook how much our internal worlds can literally determine what we see. When our\ninternal minds become anxious and sense a loss of “control,” they tend to concoct ways to distort our\nperceptions so as to restore that sense of inner control. I describe the Control Factor as an “active and\ncontinuous process” designed to maintain that sense, if not illusion, of control. We natural ly think that our\nthinking and feeling processes are passive; that they just happen. Yet when faced with truly frightening\nprospects, the mind is geared to actively distort.\n\nSimilarly, the sense of control must be continuously maintained so the Control Factor operates constantly.\nIn turn, the sum of this active and continuous undertaking makes these perceptions all the more familiar and\nthus seemingly all the more “real.” In one sense, the Control Factor is the mechanism of what Andy\nMcCarthy entitled one of his numerous excellent books- willful blindness. The Control Factor is cleverer\nthan we are aware; that is almost tautological as, if our minds are to create ways to keep us in denial, they\nmust out maneuver our conscious thinking.\n\nSince World War II, America has had limited experience with threats coming to the homeland. Most of\nAmerica’s history has been about “over there,” where we have always known that if things got too out of\nhand (e.g. Vietnam) we could always ret urn home. The current generations, for a wide array of reasons,\nhave had virtually no experience with a threat to this land. (The documentary, Generation Zero, is\ninteresting on this point).\n\nConsequently, the process of waking up to such a threat parallels the arc of a typical horror film. In such a\nfilm, there is typically a cast of characters surrounding one or two main characters. We in the audience\nknow there is a threat coming — be it a monster, a virus, a psycho killer, an alien, the blob that ate\nCincinnati etc. This threat is typically defined by its intent- the singular goal of destroying the characters.\nMuch of the initial exposition shows how the characters first are oblivious to the destruction the threat\nbrings about, then explain it in familiar terms only to finally open their eyes to see that something uniquely\nterrifying is happening. The next stage usually involves a series of failed attempts to deal with the threat- fr\nom trying to negotiate with it, to appease it, to coax it, to threaten it with ineffective weapons and so forth.\nMost of these failings are due to not adequately appreciating the threat for what it truly is and projecting\nonto it a host of other attributes instead. The final stage generally involves a back-up-against-the-wall\ndecision by whichever characters remain alive. I named this the “turnaround moment” when the character\nbecomes willing to be as ruthless as the threat. That change in mental state is necessary to ensure survival.\nUltimately, the storyline is a race for whichever characters remain to wake up fully and use whatever\nadvantages they may still have to beat the threat.\n\nThis is the same arc our minds go through in battling our own Control Factors, our own compulsions to\ndeny that which is staring us in the face. Ultimately, the question is whether we will be able to wake up\nwhile we still have advantages and give ourselves permis sion to fully fight the battle we are in.\n\nI said ear lier that there is a structure to the Control Factor. To oversimplify, I view it much as a pyramid\nwhere on the bottom are the many minute by minute thoughts that are manipulated. I call this level of\nmaneuvers the many ”D’s” as they include the psychological defenses such as distortion, denial,\ndemonization, deflection, deletion, detachment, delusion, displacement, discolorization and so forth.\nLayered upon these are moves such as projection, where we can assign to our Islamic Enemy traits we wish\nto see in them or introject traits from them into ourselves that we wish not to acknowledge. These\nmaneuvers involve a mixing of identities where we actually lose clarity about who we are and who the\nenemy is. Projection and introjection are active almost across the board. It is always helpful, for instance, to\nask how what the enemy accuses us of is more appropriately descriptive of it. When we add Western Guilt\nand Shame, our need to be liked, and o ther psychological dimensions, basic thoughts solidify into larger\nfantasies.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025030\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He\nblamed the lliad’s and Odyssey’s villainous immortal, Thanatos, the ever-\nthreatening spirit of death and destruction to contrast with the good, life giving Eros.\nThe Yiddish word for a personified Thanatos is Moloch ha-Moves. A range of\nfixations in self-excitatory, repetitious, self-mutilating behaviors is documented in\ndomesticated animals.

Her films give the viewer an\nexperience of materiality through the moving image. She uses collaging and layering of\nthe material to manipulate sound and image, and the editing process is perhaps the most\nimportant aspect of her work.\n\nShe also talks about the importance of decision making in her work. For her, the\nartistic process does not follow a rational pattern. In a converation we had, together with\nthe engineer Kenric McDowell, at the Google Cultural Institute, she explained this by\nciting a story from theater director Peter Brook’s 1968 book The Empty Space. When\nBrook designed the set for his production of 7he Tempest in the late 1960s, he started by\nmaking a Japanese garden, but then the design evolved, becoming a white box, a black\nbox, a realistic set, and so on. And in the end, he returned to his original idea. Brook\nwrites that he was shocked at having spent a month on his labors, only to end at the\nbeginning. But this shows that the creative artistic process is a succession whose every\nstep builds on the next and which eventually comes to an unpredictable conclusion. The\nprocess is not a logical or rational succession but has mostly to do with the artist’s\nfeelings in reaction to the preceding result. Rose said, of her own artistic decision\nmaking:\n\nIt, to me, is distinctively different from machine learning, because at each\ndecision there’s this core feeling that comes from a human being, which has to do\nwith empathy, which has to do with communication, which has to do with\nquestions about our own mortality that only a human could ask.\n\nThis point underlines the fundamental difference between any human artistic production\nand so-called computer creativity. Rose sees AI more as a possible way to create better\ntools for humans:\n\nA place I can imagine machine learning working for an artist would be not in\ndeveloping an independent subjectivity, like writing a poem or making an image,\nbut actually in filling in gaps that are to do with labor, like the way that\nPhotoshop works with different tools that you can use.\n\nAnd though such tools may not seem spectacular, she says, “they might have a larger\ninfluence on art,” because they provide artists with further possibilities in their creative\nwork.\n\nMcDowell added that he, too, believes there are false expectations around AI.\n“Tve observed,” he said, “that there’s a sort of magical quality to the idea of a computer\nthat does all the things that we do.” He continued: “There’s almost this kind of demonic\nmirror that we look into, and we want it to write a novel, we want it to make a film—we\nwant to give that away somehow.” He is instead working on projects wherein humans\ncollaborate with the machine. One of the current aims of AI research is to find new\nmeans of interaction between humans and software. And art, one could say, needs to\nplay a key role in that enterprise, since it focuses on our subjectivity and on essential\nhuman aspects like empathy and mortality.\n\n147\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016367\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I was earning $7.50 per hour at the time. I didn't go.\n\nI got up my nerve and talked to my mother, who had been extremely helpful and caring\nwhen I came out to her about BDSM. During the BDSM conversation, I'd been scared --\nthen I felt immense relief as Mom told me that there was nothing wrong with me, and\nreassured me that I wasn't \"giving up my liberation.\" When it came to orgasms, though,\nshe seemed unsure of what to say. She did at least tell me that she, too, couldn't come\neasily, which made me feel a little better.\n\nMost helpful was the therapist I found on the Kink Aware Professionals list -- an online\nlist of doctors, lawyers, and other professionals who believe they understand alternative\nsexualities such as BDSM. I tried one therapist who didn't seem to get it, but the second\ntherapist I saw was wonderful. He helped me through an enormous amount of my BDSM\nanxiety. The orgasm problem was thornier, but he didn't make any assumptions, and he\ndid listen carefully, which was more than most people did.\n\nMy therapist gently encouraged me to get a second opinion about my how my body\nworked, from a new gynecologist. Irrationally, I didn't. I suppose I still felt crushed by\nhow the first gynecologist had reacted. I also hoped I'd learn to come as I explored\nBDSM more -- which turned out to be true.\n\nKK ok\n\nVIL. Figuring It Out\n\nIn retrospect, I recognize that I went through a brief period where I had orgasms\nsometimes -- weak ones. But the orgasms were hard to hang on to because they happened\nduring sex with my boyfriend. This would be the same boyfriend I described at the\nbeginning of this piece, when I wrote: now I have the best boyfriend I've ever had. but\njust like every other one, he can't get me off. big dick? oral sex? tons of foreplay? kink?\nit's all there.\n\nNow I see, in retrospect, that not everything was there: neither of us had questioned our\nsexual assumptions, our societally-determined sexual scripts. And one of the biggest\nsexual scripts is that sex ends with the man's orgasm. That the man's orgasm is the goal.\n\nIt's very hard to think around these scripts. It's very hard to even be aware of them. So,\nsince my paramount goal during sex was obviously \"satisfying my man,” I often pushed\nmy orgasm away due to my focus on him. I knew that if I came then I'd feel tired and less\ninterested in sex (at least for a while). And obviously, if he were to have his all-important\nmanly orgasm, I couldn't go falling asleep on him could I? I couldn't even pause to\nmentally process my sensations if he seemed to be enjoying himself, now could I? Plus,\nonce he'd come, I certainly couldn't expect him to stimulate me any more than he already\nhad, because he was tired; he'd just had an orgasm!\n\n(These days, one of my #1 judgments of whether a new partner could be good for me is\nthis: if I didn't come before he did, then does he take a moment post-orgasm to catch his\nbreath, and then turn to me and smile and offer to do what it takes?)\n\nIn the end, figuring it out was almost anticlimactic.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018505\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I had established\nThe Reality Club, an informal gathering of intellectuals who met in New York City to\npresent their work before peers in other disciplines. (Note: In 1996, The Reality Club\nwent online as Edge.org). Our first speaker? Stephen Wolfram, a “wunderkind” who\nhad arrived in Princeton at the Institute for Advanced Study. I distinctly recall his\nfocused manner as he sat down on a couch in my living room and spoke uninterrupted for\nabout an hour before the assembled group.\n\nSince that time, Stephen has become intent making the world’s knowledge easily\ncomputable and accessible. His program Mathematica is the definitive system for\nmodern technical computing. Wolfram|Alpha computes expert-level answers using AI\ntechnology. He considers his Wolfram Language to be the first true computational\ncommunication language for humans and AIs.\n\nI caught up with him again four years ago, when we arranged to meet in\nCambridge, Massachusetts, for a freewheeling conversation about Al. Stephen walked\nin, said hello, sat down, and, looking at the video camera set up to record the\nconversation for Edge, began to talk and didn’t stop for two and a half hours.\n\nThe essay that follows is an edited version of that session, which was a Wolfram\nmaster class of sorts and is an appropriate way to end this volume—just as Stephen’s\nReality Club talk in the ’80s was a great way to initiate the ongoing intellectual\nenterprise whose result is the rich community of thinkers presenting their work to one\nanother and to the public in this book.\n\n181\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016401\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

However, achieving this cognitive stage does not mean one automatically\nchanges their belief systems, but rather that the mental machinery is in place to consider\nthe possibilities. Because many people do not reach this level of cognitive development in the\narea of moral and ethical thinking, it is associated with negative traits (“moral relativism”\nand “flip-flopping”). However, this cognitive flexibility generally leads to more sophisticated and\napplicable moral codes, which in turn leads to morality which is actually more stable because\nit is built upon extensive and deep consideration rather than simple adherence to reflexive or\nrationalized ideologies.\n\n12.4.2 Stages of Development of Empathic Ethics\n\nComplementing Kohlberg’s logic-and-justice-focused approach, Carol Gilligan’s [Gil82] “ethics\nof care” model is a moral development theory which posits that empathetic understanding\nplays the central role in moral progression from an initial self-centered modality to a socially\nresponsible one. The ethics of care model is concerned with the ways in which an individual\ncares (responds to dilemmas using empathetic responses) about self and others. As shown in\nTable 12.3, the ethics of care is broken into the same three primary stage as Kohlberg, but with\na focus on empathetic, emotional caring rather than rationalized, logical principles of justice.\n\nStage Principle of Care\n\nPre-Conventional Individual Survival\n\nConventional Self Sacrifice for the Greater Good\n\nPost-Conventional Principle of Nonviolence (do not hurt others, or oneself)\n\nTable 12.3: Gilligan’s Stages of the Ethics of Care\n\nFor an “ethics of care” approach to be applied in an AGI, the AGI must be capable of internal\nsimulation of other minds it encounters, in a similar manner to how humans regularly simulate\none another internally. Without any mechanism for internal simulation, it is unlikely that an\nAGI can develop any sort of empathy toward other minds, as opposed to merely logically\nor probabilistically modeling other agents’ behavior or other minds’ internal contents. In a\nCogPrime context, this ties in closely with how CogPrime handles episodic knowledge — partly\nvia use of an internal simulation world, which is able to play “mental movies” of prior and\nhypothesized scenarios within the AGI system’s mind.\n\nHowever, in humans empathy involves more than just simulation, it also involves sensorimotor\nresponses, and of course emotional responses — a topic we will discuss in more depth in Appendix\n?? where we review the functionality of mirror neurons and mirror systems in the human brains.\nWhen we see or hear someone suffering, this sensory input causes motor responses in us similar\nto if we were suffering ourselves, which initiates emotional empathy and corresponding cognitive\nprocesses.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013130\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It facilitated a secondary market to\ntrade stocks and gave rise to trading clubs during the mid-\n17: century where speculators would congregate.\nMessengers would rush to and from the exchange to\nupdate pricing to customers.\n\nIn 1867, the invention of the stock-\nticker machine, also known as the\nticker tape, obviated the need for\nmessengers. Stock transaction data\nwas transmitted by telegraph to a\nticker tape that would continuously\nprint out abbreviated company\nnames (ticker symbols) followed by the price and volume\ndata. Thomas Edison later upgraded the system to reach\na printing speed of one character per second. Ticker tape\neliminated the need for messengers and allowed people to\ntrade in “real time” from long distance.\n\nIn 1900, 14 year-old Jesse Lauriston Livermore started\nworking as a quotation board boy in the Boston office of\nPaine Webber. His job was to update the board with\ninformation coming off the ticker tape. He became\ninterested in the behavior of stock prices and began\nrecording price movements that enabled him to spot\npatterns prior to sizeable advances and declines. A fellow\noffice boy later talked him into speculating on a stock on\nmargin at a bucket shop. Two days later, Jesse sold the\nposition with a $3.12 profit. He soon quit his job and\nstarted trading for a living.\n\nJesse made his first $1,000 (around $27,600 in today’s\ndollars) at the age of 15. He was later banned by most\nbucket shops in Boston as he had outfoxed many of the\nshady operators. By the age of 20, he had accumulated\n$10,000. Then came the big payday — the Panic of 1907 —\nduring which Jesse shorted the market and made $1\nmillion ($25 million in today’s dollars). He would top this\nfeat and live up to the reputation as “The Great Bear of\nWall Street” by shorting the market in 1929 for an\nastounding $100 million profit ($1.43 billion in 2017!),\nmaking him one of the richest men in the world.\n\nThe combination of elevated\ninvestor complacency and a\n\ntightening Fed makes the\n\nmarket vulnerable to a pullback.\n\nUnfortunately, the concept of diversification probably\nnever crossed Jesse’s mind. He somehow managed to lose\nall his money and was bankrupt by 1934. The bankruptcy\nresulted in an automatic suspension of his membership\non the Chicago Board of Trade. In 1940, the legendary\ntrader, suffering from depression, shot himself in the\ncloak room of Manhattan’s Sherry-Netherland Hotel.\n\nRise of the Machines\n\nHow things have changed from\nthose simpler days when humans\nwere doing the trading. Today,\nwith the advent of technology,\nmarket activity is dominated by\npassive and various quantitative\nstrategies. It is estimated that\nfundamental discretionary investors now account for only\n10% of the trading volume. Big inflow into major ETFs\nprompted buying across the board regardless of company\nspecific issues and valuations. Big data and machine\nlearning are the new buzz words. Forbes recently featured\na quant fund run by three twenty-somethings. Their\nassets under management was in the low tens of millions\nof dollars, yet they averaged $1 billion in transactions, or\n10,000 to 40,000 trades each day. Since there are only\n86,400 seconds in a day, this fund would generate a trade\nevery 2.16 to 8.64 seconds if it worked around the clock.\nMuch of the decision making and trade execution, of\ncourse, has been taken over by software algorithms. These\nwhiz kids employed statistical arbitrage trading strategies\nin stocks and currencies, and closed out all trading\npositions at the end of each day.\n\nThe allure of sophisticated computer models trouncing\ntheir human competitors has continued to attract inflow\nto quant funds. It is estimated that quantitative hedge\nfunds now manage more than $1 trillion, about one-third\nof the $3 trillion hedge fund industry. While there are\nindeed brilliant quant managers who have delivered\nstrong returns over a long period of time, the sheer size of\nthe industry means there are likely more pretenders than\ncontenders. Given that many funds employ similar\nstrategies (e.g., trend following), a reversal in trend could\ncreate disruptive market movements, not to mention the\nthreat of rogue algorithms wreaking havoc on the market.\n\nMONTHLY MARKET REVIEW NOVEMBER 2017 2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012096\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Rajoub, 634 F.3d 604, 607-08 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (holding that TVPA liability\ndoes not extend to non-natural persons), and Aziz v. Alcolac, Inc., 658 F.3d 388, 392 (4th Cir. 2011) (same), and Bowoto v.\nChevron Corp., 621 F.3d 1116, 1126-27 (9th Cir. 2010) (same). In the interest of judicial economy, plaintiffs respectfully\nrequest that this Court defer deciding their appeal of the dismissal of ther TVPA claims until the Supreme Court has decided\nMohamad and the Court can obtain the benefit thereafter of the parties’ views of the implications of that decision for this\ncase.\n\nAlternatively, should Mohamad not result in an opinion or if this Court is inclined to reach a decision on the TVPA claims\nindependently of Mohamad, it should vacate the district court’s dismissals. The TVPA *138 creates an action in tort and,\ntherefore, should be interpreted in light of the well-established common law (and international law) presumption that\norganizations are liable in tort for the acts of their agents. See Balt. & Potomac R.R. v. Fifth Baptist Church, 108 U.S. 317,\n330 (1883); Br. for Petitioners at 12-17, Mohamad v. Palestinian Authority, No. 11-88 (Sup. Ct. Dec. 14, 2011) (“Mohamad\nBr.”). Moreover, the TVPA’s use of the term “individual” comports with this presumption because this term has often been\nconstrued as synonymous with the term “person,” which has a broad legal meaning that includes organizational entities, such\nas corporations. See, e.g., Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 428 & n.13 (1998); Mohamad Br. at 19-20 (citing cases\nfrom federals courts of appeals); see also id. at 17-18 (noting that dictionary definitions of the word “individual” often\ninclude non-natural entities).\n\nFurthermore, such a broad interpretation is consistent with the structure of the TVPA, which incorporates agency principles\nby imposing liability on individuals who “subject[]” a victim to torture or extrajudicial killing. /d. at 25-26. This construction\nalso is consistent with the fact that organizational liability exists under other federal statutes that provide civil remedies to\nvictims of torture and extrajudicial killing. See, e.g., *139 Brentwood Acad. v. Term. Secondary Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 531 U.S.\n288 (2001) (permitting a section 1983 suit against an association); Ungar v. Palestine Liberation Org., 402 F.3d 274, 276 (1st\nCir. 2005) (affirming ATA judgment against terrorist organizations); Murphy v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 740 F. Supp. 2d 51,\n72 (D.D.C. 2010) (finding terrorist organization liable under 28 U.S.C. § 1605A(c)); see also Mohamad Br. at 30-34. Finally,\nthe legislative history of the TVPA reveals that Congress’s use of the term “individual” in the TVPA was only to “make\ncrystal clear that foreign states or their entities cannot be sued ....” S. Rep. No. 102-249, at 6 (1991), and that Congress\nrepeatedly assumed that organizations would be proper defendants in TVPA lawsuits. Mohamad Br. at 43-49. For these and\nother reasons elaborated in the briefs before the Supreme Court in Mohamad, Congress clearly intended the TVPA to provide\na remedy against a broader set of defendants that includes entities other than natural persons.\n\nIV. The District Court Improperly Dismissed the Negligence And Intentional Tort Claims\n\nPlaintiffs pleaded a number of state law tort claims against defendants subject to this appeal, including negligence, negligent\ninfliction of emotional distress (“NIED”), intentional infliction of emotional distress (“LIED”), assault and battery, trespass,\nand recovery under New York’s *140 wrongful death and survival statutes. The district court wrongly dismissed claims\nagainst defendants under each of these theories of tort liability.\n\nA. The District Court Wrongly Dismissed the Negligence Claims\n\nThe district court dismissed plaintiffs’ claims for negligence and NIED based on its conclusion that the plaintiffs failed to\n“allege or identify a duty owed to Plaintiffs” by the defendants. SPA55 (Terrorist Attacks 1; cf’ SPA232 n.6 (Terrorist\nAttacks V); SPA88 (Terrorist Attacks IT). The court was simply wrong about this: plaintiffs expressly alleged a duty owed and\nviolated by the defendants. See R.3916 (“By virtue of their participation in the conspiracy to commit acts of international\nterrorism against the United States, its nationals and allies, including the September 11th Attack, the defendants negligently,\nintentionally, recklessly, willfully and wantonly breached duties of care owed to plaintiffs and the employees of plaintiffs’\ninsureds.””) (emphasis added).\n\nBecause the district court overlooked the plain language of the pleadings, it did not conduct an analysis of whether\ndefendants did, in fact, owe plaintiffs a duty of care. Had it done so, it would have found the duty to be manifest.

As with other Chinese\nimmigrants who rely on traditional Chinese-language media for information, the anti-\nAmerican hothouse created by WeChat’s “news channels” leads to a type of resentful pro-\n\nChinese nationalism that is ripe for exploitation by the Chinese government.\n\nWeChat may be no more slanted in its treatment of information than American media\nthat serve domestic political extremes, but there is no precedent for the situation\nWeChat has created: A vast and vital community of Americans gets most of its “news”\nfrom, and does most of its communicating via, a platform known to be censored by a\nforeign government that opposes free speech and has been named by the US National\n\nSecurity Strategy as the greatest long-term security challenge the nation faces.\n\nWestern Media\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has always recognized the usefulness of the overseas\nmedia (both in local languages and Chinese) as a means to get its message out. Foreign-\nand Chinese-language media have always served the cause of China’s revolution. For\nexample, in the 1930s, foreign journalist Edgar Snow sang the praises of the Chinese\nCommunist Party and specifically its chairman, Mao Zedong. The Party conducted a\ncampaign in the United States in the 1940s to turn the American public against the\nregime of Chiang Kai-shek and to soften criticism of China’s Communists. Organizations\nsuch as the Institute of Pacific Relations, which provided Americans with in-depth\ncoverage of Asia, were staffed by Communist agents and played an important role in\nfashioning public opinion on America’s relations with China.

Or should it be developed out in the\nopen, in the manner of open-source software projects like Linux? (an \"open approach\").\nThe open approach allows the collective intelligence of the world to more fully participate\n— but also potentially allows the more unsavory elements of the human race to take some\nof the publicly-developed AGI concepts and tools private, and develop them into AGIs\nwith selfish or evil purposes in mind. Is there some meaningful intermediary between these\nextremes?\n\ne Should governments regulate AGI, with Friendliness in mind (as advocated carefully by e.g\nBill Hibbard [Hib02])? Or will this just cause AGI development to move to the handful of\ncountries with more liberal policies? ... or cause it to move underground, where nobody can\nsee the dangers developing? As a rough analogue, it’s worth noting that the US government’s\nimposition of restrictions on stem cell research, under President George W. Bush, appears\nto have directly stimulated the provision of additional funding for stem cell research in other\nnations like Korea, Singapore and China.\n\nThe former issue is, obviously, highly relevant to CogPrime (which is currently being devel-\noped via the open source CogPrime project); and so the various dimensions of this issues are\nworth briefly sketching here.\n\nWe have a strong skepticism of selfappointed elite groups that claim (even if they genuinely\nbelieve) that they know what’s best for everyone, and a healthy respect for the power of collective\nintelligence and the Global Brain, which the open approach is ideal for tapping. On the other\nhand, we also understand the risk of terrorist groups or other malevolent agents forking an open\nsource AGI project and creating something terribly dangerous and destructive. Balancing these\nfactors against each other rigorously, seems beyond the scope of current human science.\n\nNobody really understands the social dynamics by which open technological knowledge plays\nout in our current world, let alone hypothetical future scenarios. Right now there exists open\nknowledge about many very dangerous technologies, and there exist many terrorist groups, yet\nthese groups fortunately make scant use of these technologies. The reasons why appear to be\nessentially sociological — the people involved in these terrorist groups tend not to be the ones\nwho have mastered the skills of turning public knowledge on cutting-edge technologies into real\nengineered systems. But while it’s easy to observe this sociological phenomenon, we certainly\nhave no way to estimate its quantitative extent from first principles. We don’t really have a\nstrong understanding of how safe we are right now, given the technology knowledge available\nright now via the Internet, textbooks, and so forth. Even relatively straightforward issues such\nas nuclear proliferation remain confusing, even to the experts.\n\nIt’s also quite clear that keeping powerful AGI locked up by an elite group doesn’t really\nprovide reliable protection against malevolent human agents. History is rife with such situations\ngoing awry, e.g. by the leadership of the group being subverted, or via brute force inflicted by\nsome outside party, or via a member of the elite group defecting to some outside group in the\ninterest of personal power or reward or due to group-internal disagreements, etc. There are\nmany things that can go wrong in such situations, and the confidence of any particular group\nthat they are immune to such issues, cannot be taken very seriously. Clearly, neither the open\nnor closed approach qualifies as a panacea.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013124\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

(That's one of the things feminism has\nalways worked towards: giving people many sources of support and safety nets, so people\ncan leave abusive partners if necessary.) But.

I think the feelings I outline in this piece are shared by a lot of people, and that\nthey're one of the reasons people often get angry about porn. But as I said in \"BDSM\nCan Be 'Love Sex' Too,\" I don't think restricting porn is the answer to these feelings. I\nthink the answer is encouraging people to be honest, yet respectful and flexible about\ntheir desires. For many people, mainstream porn seems to function as sex education --\nand that can be a real problem, because mainstream porn shows a very specific\nstereotype of sexuality. But if more people had better and more complete sex education,\nthen more people would recognize that mainstream porn is a very limited and particular\nproduct, and they'd also recognize that most people aren't interested in actually enacting\nthat style of sexuality. I also think porn probably receives an unfair portion of the blame\nin these debates. It's possible that the current ubiquity of porn is partly to blame for \"sex-\ncrazy nympho dreamgirl\" anxieties, but there are plenty of other stereotype sources in\nour culture -- I wish that all the people who talk about banning porn would also talk\nabout banning romantic comedies!\n\nte Kk ok\n\nI'm Not Your Sex-Crazy Nympho Dreamgirl\n\nThere's this cultural image of what it means to be female, and good in bed.

S. Mill and later by behavioral psychologists, like Pavlov and B. F. Skinner. On\nthis view, the abstractness and hierarchical structure of representations is something of an\nillusion, or at least an epiphenomenon. All the work can be done by association and\npattern detection—especially if there are enough data.\n\nOver time, there has been a seesaw between this bottom-up approach to the\nmystery of learning and Plato’s alternative, top-down one. Maybe we get abstract\nknowledge from concrete data because we already know a lot, and especially because we\nalready have an array of basic abstract concepts, thanks to evolution. Like scientists, we\ncan use those concepts to formulate hypotheses about the world. Then, instead of trying\nto extract patterns from the raw data, we can make predictions about what the data should\nlook like if those hypotheses are right. Along with Plato, such “rationalist” philosophers\nand psychologists as Descartes and Noam Chomsky took this approach.\n\nHere’s an everyday example that illustrates the difference between the two\nmethods: solving the spam plague. The data consist of a long unsorted list of messages in\nyour in-box. The reality is that some of these messages are genuine and some are spam.\nHow can you use the data to discriminate between them?\n\nConsider the bottom-up technique first. You notice that the spam messages tend\nto have particular features: a long list of addressees, origins in Nigeria, references to\nmillion-dollar prizes or Viagra. The trouble is that perfectly useful messages might have\nthese features, too. If you looked at enough examples of spam and non-spam emails, you\nmight see not only that spam emails tend to have those features but that the features tend\nto go together in particular ways (Nigeria plus a million dollars spells trouble). In fact,\nthere might be some subtle higher-level correlations that discriminate the spam messages\nfrom the useful ones—a particular pattern of misspellings and IP addresses, say. If you\ndetect those patterns, you can filter out the spam.\n\nThe bottom-up machine-learning techniques do just this. The learner gets\nmillions of examples, each with some set of features and each labeled as spam (or some\nother category) or not. The computer can extract the pattern of features that distinguishes\nthe two, even if it’s quite subtle.\n\nHow about the top-down approach? I get an email from the editor of the Journal\nof Clinical Biology. It refers to one of my papers and says that they would like to publish\nan article by me. No Nigeria, no Viagra, no million dollars; the email doesn’t have any\nof the features of spam. But by using what I already know, and thinking in an abstract\nway about the process that produces spam, I can figure out that this email is suspicious.\n\n(1) I know that spammers try to extract money from people by appealing to\nhuman greed.\n\n(2) I also know that legitimate “open access” journals have started covering their\ncosts by charging authors instead of subscribers, and that I don’t practice anything like\nclinical biology.\n\nPut all that together and I can produce a good new hypothesis about where that\nemail came from. It’s designed to sucker academics into paying to “publish” an article in\na fake journal. The email was a result of the same dubious process as the other spam\nemails, even though it looked nothing like them. I can draw this conclusion from just one\nexample, and I can go on to test my hypothesis further, beyond anything in the email\nitself, by googling the “editor.”\n\n153\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016373\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The Court also granted particular defendants’ motions *21 to\ndismiss claims predicated on the Torture Victims’ Protection Act, the Alien Tort Statute, RICO, and common law causes of\naction.\n\nOn October 7, 2010, the parties jointly requested that the district court enter Rule 54(b) final judgments in favor of all\ndefendants dismissed through Terrorist Attacks IV and Terrorist Attacks V, as well as with respect to dismissals effectuated\nthrough the Terrorist Attacks I and Terrorist Attacks IT decisions, to the extent not within the scope of the January 10, 2006\nRule 54(b) judgment. Seventy-five defendants fell within the scope of that joint request.\n\nThe district court granted the parties’ joint request for entry of Rule 54(b) judgments on July 13, 2011, and the clerk of court\nentered final judgment in favor of the seventy-five defendants pursuant to Rule 54(b) on July 14, 2011. Plaintiffs in all\nactions filed timely Notices of Appeal as to all Rule 54(b) defendants within the scope of their respective actions.\n\nFollowing the filing of plaintiffs’ Notices of Appeal, this Court issued its decision in Doe v. Bin Laden, 663 F.3d 64, 2011\nU.S. App. Lexis 22516 (2d Cir. 2011) (per curiam), another of the cases comprising the September 11th MDL. In Doe, the\nCourt held that the FSIA’s “terrorism exception, rather than limiting the jurisdiction conferred by the noncommercial tort *22\nexception, provides an additional basis for jurisdiction.” Jd. at *19 (emphasis added). Therefore, the Court concluded, “the\nnoncommercial tort exception [§ 1605(a)(5)] can be a basis for a suit arising from the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001.”\nId. The Court remanded the case against Afghanistan for jurisdictional discovery. Jd. at *20-21.\n\nThe Court recognized that its holding conflicted with and abrogated the prior panel’s decision in Terrorist Attacks HT, and\nnoted that the Circuit had employed its mini-en banc procedure, whereby the new decision had been circulated to all active\njudges and had received no objections, including from members of the panel that decided Terrorist Attacks III. Id. at *19-20\nn.10. Doe, therefore, is now the law of this Circuit, and Terrorist Attacks Iil’s holding regarding § 1605(a)(5) has been\noverruled. See Frontera, 582 F.3d at 400 (applying the mini-en banc process and holding that “to the extent that” an earlier\nopinion “conflicts with our holding today ... it is overruled’).\n\nIn light of Doe, plaintiffs moved this Court to summarily vacate the dismissals in favor of defendants’ SRC, SJRC and NCB,\nand remand those claims for discovery, on the grounds that Doe abrogates and overrules the legal basis for those dismissals.\nAppellants’ Motion to Summarily Vacate *23 and Remand, Case No. 11-3294, Docket # 243, at p. 7. Those defendants\nsought and received an extension of time until January 23, 2012 to respond to that Motion, which remains pending as of the\ndate of the filing of this brief.\n\nIn an effort to narrow the scope of these appeals, plaintiffs in all cases agreed voluntarily to withdrew the appeals as to\ntwenty-two defendants.° Several additional non-dispositive stipulations of dismissal were filed in individual cases as to other\nAppellees. As a result, these appeals now focus on the dismissals for failure to state a claim of defendants Al Rajhi Bank,\nSaudi American Bank (SAMBA), DMI Trust, Kamel, and Dallah al Baraka, and the dismissals for lack of personal\njurisdiction of defendants Abdullah bin Laden, Bakr bin Laden, Omar bin Laden, Tariq bin Laden, Yeslam bin Laden, Dallah\nAvco, DMI Administrative Services, Faisal Islamic Bank, Saleh al Hussayen, Yousef Jameel, Abdulrahman bin Mahfouz,\nKhaled bin Mahfouz, NCB, Obeid, Abdullah al Rajhi, Saleh al Rajhi, Suleiman al Rajhi, Schreiber & Zindel Treuhand\nAnstalt, Frank Zindel, Engelbert Schreiber, Sr., Engelbert Schreiber, Jr., Shamal, Swailem, Tadamon, Turki, Martin *24\nWachter, Erwin Wachter, Sercor Treuhand Anstalt, Asat, Naseef, Ali, Basha, Khalifa, Aqeel, al Kadi, and al-Buthe.\nDisposition Below\n\nAs noted above, in Jerrorist Attacks I, Terrorist Attacks Il, SAMBA I, DMI-Kamel, Terrorist Attacks IV, and Terrorist\nAttacks V, the district court dismissed all claims against the defendant-appellees.

I warned Bibi, both in the Knesset and in\na series of speeches, about the alternative on the Palestinian side if those who\nwanted a negotiated peace had nothing but stalemate to show for it. And lives, I\ninsisted, were at stake. Both through closed-door sessions of the Knesset’s security\nand foreign affairs committee, and my own contacts in military intelligence, I was\nconvinced that the result would be a second, much more deadly, intifada.

In fact, I announced that if Bibi did go ahead and finalize the terms for\nour Oslo redeployment, Labor would once again provide the extra Knesset votes\nneeded for him to get it approved.\n\nEarly in 1998, he sent word that he wanted to talk. The message came through\nYaakov Ne’eman, his Finance Minister and a prominent lawyer whom I knew and\nliked. He and I held an exploratory meeting at which he proposed talks with Bibi\non the prospect of a unity government that would help move the peace process\nforward. I said I’d talk, with one proviso: the discussions would be genuinely\nsecret, with no leaks. I was not prepared to engage in political gamesmanship. In\nMay, Bibi sent an assurance of confidentiality through Ne’eman. The first of about\na half-dozen meetings came a few days later at the Prime Minister’s residence in\nJerusalem. Then, we shifted venue, meeting at a Mossad-owned villa north of Tel\nAviv. I brought along Bougie Herzog, a bright young lawyer, and Labor Party\nmember, who was working in the same law firm and Ne’eman. It was by no means\nclear we’d agree on a unity government. To my amusement, if not altogether to my\nsurprise, I got word that Bibi was putting out separate political feelers to Shimon\nPeres. But before long, it became clear there was a specific political motivation\nbehind his approaching me. It was indeed the peace process.

During a stint as a Senate staffer, the married Porter\nhad an affair with an intern, costing him his job. His girlfriend Samantha\nDravis had moved in with Porter in the summer of 2017, while, quite\nunbeknownst to her, he was seeing Hicks. “I cheated on you because you're\nnot attractive enough,” he later told Dravis.\n\nIn a potentially criminal break of protocol, Porter had gained access\nto his raw FBI clearance reports and seen the statements of his ex-wives.\nHis most recent ex-wife had also written a blog about his alleged abuse,\nwhich, while it did not name him, clearly fingered him. Concerned about\nthe damaging impact his former wives could have on his security review,\nhe recruited Dravis to help him smooth his relationship with both women.\n\nLewandowski, Hicks’s former boyfriend, caught wind of the Hicks-\nPorter relationship and began working to expose it; by some reports,\nhe got paparazzi to follow Hicks. Though Porter’s history of abuse was\nslowly making its way to the surface as a result of the FBI investigation,\nthe Lewandowski campaign against Hicks cut through many other efforts\nto cover up Porter’s transgressions.\n\nDravis, in the autumn of 2017, heard the Lewandowski-pushed\nrumors of the Hicks-Porter relationship. After finding Hicks’s number\nlisted under a man’s name in Porter's contacts, Dravis confronted Porter,\nwho promptly threw her out. Moving back in with her parents, she began\nher own revenge campaign, openly talking about Porter's security clear-\nance issues, including to people inside the White House counsel's office,\nsaying he had protection at the highest levels in the White House. Then,\nalong with Lewandowski, Dravis helped leak the details of the Hicks-\nPorter romance to the Daily Mail, which published a story about it on\nFebruary 1.\n\nBut Dravis, joined by Porter's former wives, decided that, outra-\ngeously, he had come out looking good in the Daily Mail account—he\nwas part of a glam power couple! Porter called Dravis to taunt her: “You\nthought you could get me!” Dravis and his former wives all then publicly\nrevealed their abuse at his hand. His first wife said he kicked and punched\nher; she even produced a photograph of her black eye. His second wife\n\nSIEGE -\n\ninformed the media that she had filed an emergency protective orc\nagainst him.\n\nThe White House, or at least Kelly—and likely Hicks—had been aw:\nof many of these claims and, effectively, covered them up. (“You usua\nhave enough competent people for White House positions to weed out t\nwife beaters, but you couldn't be so choosy in the Trump White House,’ sz\none Republican acquaintance of Porter's.) The furor that erupted arou\nPorter and his troubling gross-guy history not only annoyed Trump\n“He stinks of bad press”—it further weakened Kelly. On February 7, af\nboth of his former wives gave interviews to CNN, Porter resigned.\n\nA publicity-shy Hicks—Donald Trump put a high value on associa’\nwho did not steal his press opportunities—suddenly found her love |\nin the glare of intense international press scrutiny. Her affair with the d\ncredited Porter highlighted her own odd relationship with the preside\nand his family, as well as the haphazard management, interpersonal d:\nfunctions, and general lack of political savvy in the Trump court.\n\n+ +\n\nThe affair was, curiously, among the least of Hicks’s problems. Indeed, 1\nHicks the Porter scandal became perhaps a better cloud under which\nleave the administration than what almost everybody in the West Wi\nassumed was the real cloud.\n\nOn February 27, a reporter at the Washington insider newsletter Axi\nJonathan Swan, a favorite conduit for White House leaks, reported tl\nJosh Raffel was leaving the White House. In a novel arrangement, Rai\nhad come into the White House in April 2017 as the exclusive spokespers\nfor the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and his wife, Ivanka, bypa\ning the White House communications team. Raffel, who, like Kushn\nwas a Democrat, had worked for Hiltzik Strategies, the New York pub\nrelations firm that represented Ivanka’s clothing line.\n\nHope Hicks, who had also worked for the Hiltzik firm—perhaps b.\nknown for having long represented the film producer Harvey Weinste\ncaught, in the fall of 2017, in an epochal harassment and abuse scanc\nand cover-up—had originally had the same role as Raffel but at a higt\nlevel: she was the personal spokesperson for the president.

Thanks to the\ntechnological revolution brought about by the combined use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, the US is now\nexploiting its huge and virtually untouched shale and tight oil fields, whose production — although still in its infancy — is\nalready skyrocketing in North Dakota and Texas.”\n\nRegarding the Bakken shale, Maugeri’s estimate of 300 billion barrels of oil in place are exceeded by larger mean estimates\nfrom USGS geochemist Leigh Price and Continental Resources.\n\nReduced consumption due to higher CAFE standards and Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards\nthe automobile replacement cycle: this is a topic that Miles per gallon, passenger cars\n\ngenerates a lot of debate and technical discussion about\ndriving patterns, but this much is clear: CAFE standards\n\nand the ongoing replacement of older cars will improve the\nfuel efficiency of the future fleet. The Union for Concerned\nScientists has estimated the benefit of CAFE at 3 million\nbarrels of oil per day by 2030, while the Administration’s\nestimate is 2.2 million by 2025. The average 11-year age of\nUS cars is at the highest level on record, up from 8.5 years\nin 1995. While some of this increase reflects cars with\nimproved lifespans, it also reflects the impact of the\nrecession and pent-up demand to replace older cars. Asa ” ove 4983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 2013 2018 2023\nresult, our estimate of 1.5 mm bpd in oil consumption\nsavings seems reasonable in context.\n\nSource: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nImpact of rising penetration of natural gas vehicles: The rationale for natural gas vehicles (NGV) stems from a price per\nmillion BTUs for oil that’s 5x higher than natural gas. The US NGV penetration rate is low, in part due to the chicken/egg\nproblem of the lack of natural gas refueling stations, and a more limited driving range (natural gas tanks generally hold less\nenergy than diesel tanks). But the economics of NGVs are becoming more compelling for taxis, vans and buses that are\ncentrally fueled with limited ranges, and for trucks with established routes where refueling stations can be built every 300-400\nmiles. Such heavy-duty vehicles account for 17% of all petroleum usage in the US. An example: a heavy duty 18-wheeler\nmight travel 60,000 miles per year and get 5 mpg (using 12,000 gallons of diesel fuel). Assuming a $1.5 difference between\ndiesel and liquid natural gas prices, a trucking company could save ~ $18,000 in annual fuel costs. The conversion cost to\nLNG (liquid natural gas) of $70,000 would imply a 4-year payback period, which is short in the scheme of energy trade-offs.\nWe assume a very modest NGV penetration rate of 3%, which translates into reduced oil consumption of 0.3 mm bpd.\n\nOil imported for export purposes: in 2011, the US exported 0.5 mm bpd in refined petroleum products. As a result, part of the\ncurrent crude oil import tab is simply for re-export, and is not part of the country’s domestic consumption requirement.\n\n* “The Unprecedented Upsurge of Oil Production Capacity and What It Means for the World”, Leonardo Maugeri, Belfer Center for Science\nand International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School, June 2012. See sections 5-9 for a discussion of how shale and tight oil are gradually\nreplacing conventional sources, how hydraulic fracking works, a detailed examination of the Bakken Shale, how EIA and USGS data are\nbackward-looking and underestimate potential growth, the challenges for the US refining industry which has invested in the ability to process\nheavy-sour imports rather than light-sweet oil from shale, pipeline needs and a range of environmental issues.

I knew what I wanted to say. I’d talked it over\nwith the small group of campaign experts Peres had asked me to assemble\nalongside Ramon’s main team. Rather than ignore Bibi, I was going to use my\nposition as his former commander in Sayeret Matkal, someone who knew him\nwell, to explain why Peres should lead Israel.\n\n“How many of us can really understand what it means to be a Prime Minister?”\nI began. “As head of intelligence, and chief of staff, I have seen, close-up, what it\ntakes to be a Prime Minister. It is not a game. We’ve had good Prime Ministers:\nBen-Gurion, Peres, Rabin, Begin... Bibi, we know each other well, from the days\nwhen you were an officer under my command. A young officer, and a good one.\nPrime Minister is the most important and serious role in this country. Bibi, it’s not\nyet you. We need an experienced leader, who will know how to guide us with\nwisdom, strength and sensitivity. Shimon Peres is that man.”\n\nYet we were never going to be able to avoid engaging with Bibi altogether. The\nface-to-face television debate between the two candidates was set for May 27, two\ndays before the election. By American standards, the format was fairly tame. No\ndirect exchanges were permitted, only a series of questions directed at each\ncandidate by a leading political journalist, Dan Margalit. Still, it would place\nShimon and Bibi side by side. We spent two days prepping Peres, with Avraham\nBurg — an early Peace Now supporter, former Peres aide and Knesset member —\nstanding in for Bibi. Avraham played the role well, anticipating the lines of attack\nShimon would face. But as I watched, I worried that even he couldn’t replicate one\nof Bibi’s key advantages. During his time at the embassy in Washington, and\nespecially as UN ambassador, Bibi had become a frequent presence on American\ntelevision interview shows. Always articulate, he was now also an experienced,\nand completely comfortable, television performer. In our debate rehearsals, Peres\nsounded well versed on all the issues. Yet I sensed his problem wasn’t going to be\nthe message, but the medium. He sounded a bit distant, unengaged, almost as if the\nTV debate was something he knew he had to go through, but which he thought\nslightly sullied the proper purpose of politics.\n\nIn the real debate, Shimon seemed to convey the sense that merely being in the\nsame studio with a pretender as raw and untested as Bibi was offensive. When each\nof the candidates was given the opportunity at the end to ask a single question of\nthe other, Peres didn’t even bother. He did come over as the man with much more\n\n291\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011762\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Police\nofficials also wanted to: charge Rob-\nson, the selfdescribed H.idi Fleiss,\nwith lewd and lascivious acts.\n\nBy then, the department was\nfrustrated with the way the state\nattorney's office had handled the\ncase. On the same day the warrants\nwere requested, Palm Beach Police\n.

For the moment,\nthe company seems keen to squeeze what it can out of\nthe shale gale. With the help of more than $50 million\nin Israeli money, Primus is building a demonstration\nplant the size of a house near its headquarters in New\nJersey, due to open this year. The location is off the\nmap—even Google won’t guide you there, as if it were\nsome secretive skunk works facility, which is how the\ncompany likes to think of rt. The plant will take natural\ngas from the local utility, run it through its proprietary\nset of chemical reactions and, on the far end, out of a\nspigot, will come gasoline—12.7 gallons per hour at full\ncapacity. The company’s first commercial plant, due to\nstart construction next year, will likely be located near\na source of natural gas.\n\nScaling up the technology this way will reduce the\noverhead costs per unit of gasoline—that is, the cost\nof fabricating the reactors and buying the zeolites and\nfeedstocks. Plus, Primus’ technology may prove eco-\nnomical enough at a scale small to allow its plants to\nbe distributed close to remote natural gas wells or even\nsources of biomass. It is no coincidence that the com-\npany based itself in verdant New Jersey, “the Garden\nState”; proximity to biomass is crucial for producers,\nbecause transporting heavy and unwieldy wood or\ncorn stalks across large distances tends makes the end\nproduct too costly and undercuts the greenhouse-gas\nsavings that are a large part of its appeal.\n\nAs I prepare to drive off, Fang carts out one of his\ncollection of red plastic gas cans and dumps a liter or\nso of Primus-made, natural gas-to-gasoline fuel into\nmy tank. A test car tooled around on it last summer,\nwith no problems. The hope is to be able to charge\na premium for the higher-octane premium product.\n“People pay twice as much for organic food,” Boyayian\nsays. “So why not pay more for green gasoline?” My\nfuel sensor can tell the difference: it registers an anom-\nalously high miles-per-gallon number.\n\nFang gives me two thumbs up as I pull away, watch-\ning me drive off on his preferred solution to the ener-\ngy crisis. It’s unclear whether Primus will ever find\nthe occasion to turn back towards biogasoline—and\nwhether that’s a long-term fix for the world’s ener-\ngy and environmental conundrum. Striving to make\n\n27\n\ncleaner fuel for standard, dirty combustion engines\nmay reinforce drivers’ loyalty to today’s technology.\nSuch lock-in makes a true revolution difficult until\nsome alternative energy source—whether battery-\ndriven electric cars or engines modified to burn car-\nbon-neutral, as-yet-unmade biofuels—offers the kind\nof convenience and low cost that justifies replacement.\nAt present, Primus appears set to become part of a\nsprawling infrastructure that reinforces the incentives\nto use greenhouse gas-producing, gasoline-like fuels.\nAnd for all those concentrated octanes in my tank, I\nstill have to pull into a Shell station to fill up on con-\nventional gasoline, blended with corm ethanol, in order\nto drivehome. ©\n\ndavid biello is the Environment and Energy Editor for\nScientific American.

Their exposure to culture was limited to things Jewish—cantorial recitations, Yiddish\ntheater, lectures by Orthodox rabbis, Jewish museums, Catskill Mountain and Miami Beach\nentertainment.\n\nMy adult life has been dramatically different. I travel the globe, meet with world leaders, own a\nnice art collection, am deeply involved in the world of music, theater and other forms of culture,\nand lead a largely secular life (though I too enjoy cantorial music “borsht belt” humor, and a good\npastrami sandwich).\n\nYet I am their son and grandson. Although my life has taken a very different course—both\npersonally and professionally—I could not begin to explain who I am, how I got to be who I am,\nand where I am heading, without exploring my family background and heritage. It is this history\nthat helped to form me, that caused me to react against parts of it, and—most important—that\ngave me the tools necessary to choose which aspects of my traditions to accept and which to\nreject.”\n\nI had a very powerful upbringing, having been born to a family with strong views on religion,\nmorality, politics and community service. My neighborhood was tight knit. Everyone had a place\nand knew their place. Status was important, especially for our parents and grandparents, as was\n“yichus” (the Yiddish term for ancestry). But I grew up at a time of change, growth, excitement\nand opportunity.\n\nDespite the reality of pervasive anti-Jewish discrimination—in college admission, employment,\nresidency and social clubs—my generation believed there were no limits to what we could\naccomplish. If Jackie Robinson could play second base for the Brooklyn Dodgers, we could do\nanything. Maybe that was the reason so many successful people grew up in Brooklyn in the\nimmediate post-war period. (In 1971, I was selected among 40 young scholars from around the\ncountry for a distinguished fellowship. When we met in Palo Alto, California, we discovered\nclose to half the group had Brooklyn roots!) We were the breakout generation, standing on the\nbroad shoulders and backbreaking work of our immigrant grandparents and our working class\nparents.\n\nI cannot explain, indeed understand, my own world views, without describing those on whose\nshoulders I stand, that from which I have broken out, and the experiences that have shaped my\nlife. So I will begin at the beginning, with my earliest memories and the stories I have been told\nabout my upbringing.\n\nBut formative experiences do not end at childhood or adolescence. They continue throughout a\nlifetime. Learning never ends, at least for those with open minds and hearts, and, though\nideologies may remain relatively fixed over time, they adapt to changing realities and perceptions.\nWinston Churchill famously quipped, “Show me a young conservative and I’ll show you someone\nwith no heart. Show me an old liberal and I’ll show you someone with no brain.” It is surely true\nthat some people become less idealistic with age, with economic security and family\nresponsibilities. But it is equally true that some young conservatives become more liberal as they\n\n° My dear friend and teaching colleague Steven Pinker believes that parental influence may be overvalued [CITE].\nI’m certain that it varies among individuals and families.\n\n9\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017096\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

However, NARS is more than just an uncertain logic, it is also an\noverall cognitive architecture (which is centered on NARS logic, but also includes other aspects).\nCogPrime bears little relation to NARS except in the specific similarities between PLN logic\nand NARS logic, but, the other aspects of NARS are worth briefly recounting here.\n\nNARS is formulated as a system for processing tasks, where a task consists of a question or a\npiece of new knowledge. The architecture is focused on declarative knowledge, but some pieces\nof knowledge may be associated with executable procedures, which allows NARS to carry out\ncontrol activities (in roughly the same way that a Prolog program can).\n\nAt any given time a NARS system contains\n\ne working memory: a small set of tasks which are active, kept for a short time, and closely\nrelated to new questions and new knowledge\n\ne long-term memory: a huge set of knowledge which is passive, kept for a long time, and not\nnecessarily related to current questions and knowledge\n\nThe working and long term memory spaces of NARS may each be thought of as a set of\nchunks, where each chunk consists of a set of tasks and a set of knowledge.

This precaution was taken to guard against an EMP,\nor Electro-Magnetic Pulse, attack by an enemy. If so, the only way Snowden could intercept key\nstrokes was to attach a cable from his key logger to each of his fellow workers’ computers. In\nthis scenario, he would have to surreptitiously build his own wired network connecting his hidden\nkey logger to 24 separated computers. Moreover, he would have to do this wiring in an open-plan\noffice where he could not count on these additional wires, even if rigged one by one, not being\nnoticed by either other analysts on the room or the geek squad of system administrators who\nregularly checked connections. Making the task even more risky, according to my Booz Allen\nsource, there were closed-circuit cameras. The only way he could mitigate the risk of detection\nwas by having someone help him build this network.\n\nThere was a further security barrier he had to get by. Even after he managed to obtain all the\nnecessary passwords from colleagues, he had to transfer the files to an external storage device.\nThis was not a matter of simply using a thumb drive because, unlike in caper movies such as\nMission Impossible, the ports on the computers at the NSA were ordinarily sealed shut. This\nmeasure was done specifically to prevent any unauthorized downloading by NSA workers. The\nonly people at the Center who had the authorization, and the means, to open these ports and\ntransfer data were system administrators, according to the former Booz Allen executive. System\nadministrators needed to have this privilege to deal with glitches in the computers. So they were\nallowed to open up the sealed ports. But Snowden was no longer a system administrator and did\nnot have these privileges. So again, he needed some help. He either would need to borrow\nanother system administrator’s credential or forge his own. The credential he would need is\ncalled a public key infrastructure card with its authentication code embedded in a magnetic stripe.\nWhen I asked the former Booz Allen executive if Snowden possessed the skill set to forge such a\ncard, he said that he strongly doubted any NSA employee would be capable of such a forgery\nwithout special equipment. He could have, however, borrowed this credential from a system\nadministrator who was willing to help him. But just asking such a favor could “set off alarms.”\n\nThe unwitting accomplice scenario had another stumbling block: time. We know from Poitras\nthat Snowden told her in early April 2013 that he planned to deliver documents to her in six to\neight weeks (which he in fact did.) But he had not yet started working for Booz Allen at the\nCenter until that same month. It does not seem plausible (to me) that in making such a\ncommitment he was merely counting on the kindness of strangers to fulfill it The only way he\ncould have known for certain that he would be able to borrow a public key infrastructure card and\nobtain the passwords, whether by trickery or by a key router, before he had begun working at the\nCenter was that he already knew someone at the Center who would help him. But such a contact\nleads to a witting accomplice scenario.\n\nThe Witting Accomplice Possibility\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020273\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He was worried. Not about the vote,\nbut about what would come after. “Ehud, I’m sure we can topple the government,”\nhe told me. “But only you know whether we’re ready — whether you ’re ready — to\ndefeat Bibi in an election.”\n\n“I’m ready,” I said. “We are going to win.”\n\nFew agreed. In fact, there had been times during my first year-and-a-half as\nLabor leader when I wondered if I’d be able to hang on to the job. I was in charge\nof a party whose grassroots were on the left. I was, by intellect and instinct, a\npragmatist and a centrist. I did share Labor’s vision of a socially just and\ndemocratic Israel. Especially after seeing far-right rabbis egg on the fanaticism that\nultimately killed Yitzhak Rabin, I felt strongly that we needed to separate\norganized religion from our day-to-day politics. But I’d been raised with a deeper\nrespect for our Jewish traditions than many on the left. Right after Yitzhak’s\nmurder, I’d gone to see Zevulun Hammer, the leader of the National Religious\nParty. It had been part of both Labor and Likud governments ever since 1948,\nthough not Rabin’s. The NRP, too, had been drifting steadily rightward. But it still\nbasically subscribed the idea of a strong, democratic Israel under the rule of law. I\nwanted to bring the NRP back into the government under Peres, as part of the\nwidest possible political alliance against the assassination and the campaign of\nhatred that had fostered it. Sadly that didn’t happen, in part because of the anger\nagainst all Orthodox politicians after Rabin’s murder. Yet in my readiness to\nengage politically with Orthodox leaders who did not reject the very idea of peace\nnegotiations — whether in the NRP, or the increasingly influential Sephardi\nreligious party, Shas — I was outside Labor’s mainstream, and its comfort zone.\n\nOn my approach to peace as well, I differed from many on the left. Though I\nwas determined to pursue any realistic avenue to negotiations, I was convinced that\nsecurity considerations had to be paramount in what we were prepared to give up\nor accept in negotiations. I was cautious about ceding too much too soon, in case\nthe Palestinians or the Syrians proved either unequal to, or uninterested in, making\nthe hard decisions required for peace. That was an approach with, like Yitzhak\n\n305\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011776\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Success Foundation\"\n341 The Burnett Plaintiffs claim that Success Foundation\nis a sister company to Defendant ITRO and that it “sends\nmoney back and forth with the RO and IRO” and other\nsponsors of terror. (Burnett Compl. § 235.) If given the\nopportunity to replead its allegations against Success, the\nPlaintiffs would allege that, in 1998, Success Foundation\nentered into a contract to act as an agent for Defendant\nTaibah, which has since been designated a global terrorist.\n\nThe complaint does not allege that Success Foundation\nknew the money it was transferring between ITRO and\nIRO would somehow assist al Qaeda, nor does it allege\nfacts showing that Success Foundation knew the other\nunnamed organizations to which it transferred money\nwere in the business of supporting terrorism. See Boim IT,\n291 F.3d at 1012 (“To hold the defendants liable for\ndonating money without knowledge of the donee’s\nintended criminal use of the funds would impose strict\nliability.

See 18 U.S.C. § 2339(A) (including *569\n“currency or other financial securities, financial services,\n\n. weapons, [and] personnel” in definition of material\nsupport). The Federal complaint does not allege that\nJalaidan directed an enterprise and the RICO claim is\ndismissed. Wa‘el Jalaidan’s motions to dismiss the\nAshton, Burnett, and Federal complaints are denied\n\nE. IIRO\n361 Similarly, for the reasons the Court found that\nPlaintiffs made a prima facie demonstration that ITRO has\npurposefully directed its activities at the United States, the\nCourt finds they have stated a claim under the ATA in\nthat ITRO has allegedly funded al Qaeda training camps in\nAfghanistan, supported al Qaeda guest houses, and been\ninvolved in other terrorist attacks and plots. See 18 U.S.C.\n\nWESTLAW\n\n§ 2339(A) (including “currency or other financial\nsecurities, financial services, weapons, [and]\npersonnel” in definition of material support). IIRO’s\nmotions to dismiss the Ashton, Burnett, and Federal\ncomplaints are denied.\n\nF. Rabita Trust\n371 Rabita Trust moves to dismiss the complaints against\nit for failure to state a claim. These motions are denied\nwithout prejudice until this Court determines whether it\nhas personal jurisdiction over Rabita Trust.\n\nG. SAAR Network Defendants\"\n\n1. Entities\nThe Burnett and Ashton complaints’ allegations against\nthe SAAR Network entities are substantially similar to\none another.’ Paragraph 267 of the Burnett complaint and\nparagraph 339 of the Ashton complaint both state:\n\nCo-conspirators, material sponsors, and/or aiders and\nabettors of the SAAR Network include Defendants ...\nAfrican Muslim Agency, ...

J 333-39.) The SAAR\nFoundation, allegedly a financial sponsor of terror, was\nformed in the 1970s by a group of Muslim scholars and\nscientists. (Burnett Compl. J 261; Ashton Compl. ¥ 333.)\nIt was incorporated in Virginia in 1983 and dissolved in\nDecember 2000. (Burnett Compl. § 261; Ashton Compl. J\n333.)

She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she\nwas attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic.\n\n° During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student\nand volunteers for Dawkins’ foundation.\n\n° Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink.\n\n° You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a\nmale friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go.\n° You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, lowa, in April 2011.\n\n° You pulled over a chair for her in the bar, and then started running your hand up her leg under the\ntable.\n\n° She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She\n\ncrossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away.\n\nIncident 5:\n\n° This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were\ninformed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your\nfemale companion for sex in your cabin.\n\n° At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged\nCFI’s president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galapagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise,\nhowever.\n\nIncident 6:\n\n° During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once\nagain.\n\n° The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics\nNational Convention, where you were a featured speaker.\n\n° With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie.\n\n° As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her\nright breast.\n\n° She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. “Don’t do that,” she said.\n\n° BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College\n\nof the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your\nhand in motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses\nhave confirmed the complainant’s account of what happened.\n\n° In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your\nreputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016\nincident.\n\n° On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National\nUniversity in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting\nappointments.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031439\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But a wise man finds a smart man\n\nand learns from him how to avoid the mistake altogether.\n—Roy H. Williams\n\nHow do we put all this into practice? First, let’s make sure we avoid\ncreating departments around each of the 12 cognitive processes. The\norganization around subjects, which is the basis of how our schools\nare organized, is the source of the problem in both universities and\nhigh schools.\n\nSubjects create departments. Departments in universities are a se-\nrious problem for students and administrators. They represent silos\nwhere decisions are made that will help the department prosper. De-\npartments lobby for their courses to be required so they can hire more\nfaculty. They make sure majors in their departments follow certain\nrules for graduation that are intended to make students scholars in\ntheir field rather than practitioners. Departments are the reason stu-\ndents graduate without job skills. Faculty are almost always against\npractical training. English departments have to be forced to teach stu-\ndents to write. Computer science departments have to be forced to\nteach students to program in a way that would make them hirable by\nindustry. Psychology departments avoid teaching clinical psychology,\nwhich is really what students what to learn more about.\n\nFor about 10 years I have been building new online story-centered\ncurricula. The idea behind a story-centered curriculum (SCC) is that a\ngood curriculum should tell a story. That story should be one in which\nthe student plays one or more roles. Those roles should be those that\nnormally come up in such a story. These curricula are intended to\nteach students how to actually do something. The roles students play\n\n&g\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023835\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Still, there were well-established rules for setting up a defensible\nposition when an armored force halts for the night. As Eitan briefed his officers,\nI stood a few feet off to the side and listened. Suddenly, the commander of his\nAMX company interrupted. “Sir,” he said, ‘““why are we staying here — right on\nthe main road? There are Egyptians still out there. Behind us, for sure. And any\nforce ahead of us will run straight into us. Why not a few hundred yards off to\nthe side, in a place that gives us a view of any enemy movement, or allows us to\nambush an approaching force?” I could see that he was right. I expected Eitan to\nagree and alter the arrangements. But he didn’t. I think that, having ordered his\nmen to encamp on the road 20 minutes earlier, he was reluctant to get his tanks\nand halftracks moving again. No doubt, some of the exhausted crews were\nalready asleep.\n\nI parked our Jeep a few yards off the road. We organized a series of watches:\nAvraham, then Rafi and Danny, with me taking the pre-dawn stretch. A few\nhours later, Rafi nudged me awake. “I heard something,” he said, pointing west\ntoward the Suez Canal. “It was faint. But I think so.” I told him to keep\nlistening. For a while, everything seemed fine. Then, Danny woke me up. He\nsaid he was sure he heard a faint tremor, as if from tanks or APCs. I put my ear\nto the ground. I heard it too. I told him to go to Eitan’s command halftrack,\ninsist he be woken up, and tell him. When he got back, Danny said: “I told\nhim.”\n\n“And?”\n\n“Don’t know,” he replied. “He said I could go.” I tried to grab a bit more\nsleep before my watch. But barely 15 minutes later, Danny jostled me awake\nagain. “I’m sure now,” he said. “Whatever it is, it’s closer.” I went off to find\nEitan. But before I got there, a column of Egyptian T-55 tanks suddenly\nappeared on the road, 50 yards from the front of our column. I’m sure they were\nevery bit as surprised as we were to be face-to-face with enemy armor. But they\nknew what to do. They opened fire.\n\nHad we been deployed a few hundred yards off the road, we’d have seen\nthem coming. If the battalion commander had acted on Danny’s warning, we’d\nhave had an extra 20 minutes to prepare. But the shells jolted our crews awake.\nWithin 30 seconds, they were returning fire. But our tanks barely dented the\nheavily armored T- 55s. Nearly every one of theirs seemed to score a direct hit.\nWithin minutes, a number of our halftracks, and one of our tanks, were in\nflames.\n\n91\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027939\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We don't find this surprising given\nthe high demand for and strong expected growth potential of CBD products, as well as\nthe differentiation it affords independents relative to larger chain pharmacies.\nIndependent pharmacies also likely find the high-margin profile of CBD oils attractive,\nwhich we suspect is similar to those of more traditional over-the-counter drugs. OTC\ndrugs are a substantial profit driver for independent pharmacies. The greater\nacceptance of and improving sentiment towards CBD products as a viable business for\nindependent pharmacies is evidenced by a panel held by the National Community\nPharmacists Association (NCPA) at its annual convention in October 2018, which served\nto educate independent pharmacy owners of the legality, clinical uses, potential risks\nand marketing tactics of CBD oils. For those independent pharmacies that have decided\nto sell CBD oils, ensuring that they provide high-quality products is paramount, witha\nfocus on looking at the bioavailability of CBD. Additionally, independent pharmacies\nemphasize the importance of patient education, in regards to treatment and potential\nside effects.

A regular review to distinguish\nbetween systems that pose a real threat and ones that don’t would be a help, as would better intelligence. Tight\nrestrictions on new technologies will not work, and will damage America’s interests: exciting new ventures like nanosats\nwill simply move to countries from which they can be launched with greater ease.\n\nBack to top\n\nNanosatellites: Nanosats are go!\nThe Economist\n\nALTHOUGH widely used, satellites are expensive to build and to launch. That began to change last year. On November\n19th Orbital Sciences, an American company, launched a rocket from the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. It carried 29\nsatellites aloft and released them into low-Earth orbit, a record for a single mission. Thirty hours later, Kosmotras, a\nRussian joint-venture, carried 32 satellites into a similar orbit. Then, in January 2014, Orbital Sciences carried 33\nsatellites up to the International Space Station (ISS), where they were cast off a month later.\n\nMany of these 94 satellites were built in a standard format known as a CubeSat, a 10cm (4 inch) cube weighing 1.3kg\n(2.9lb) or less. Some comprised units of two or three cubes. After a decade of fits and starts, during which some 75\nCubeSats were launched, satellites of this scale and other small satellites are moving from being experimental kit to\ndelivering useful scientific data and commercial services.\n\nIn the next five years or so some 1,000 nanosats, as small satellites of 1-10kg are called, are expected to be launched.\nSome will be smaller than a CubeSat; others bigger and heavier. Some are like a matryoshka doll: the Russian launch\nincluded a satellite that launched eight smaller ones, including four PocketQubes (a 5cm cube format). One of these\nsmaller satellites, developed in Peru, released its own tiny bird.\n\nThere will be upsets along the way. In April, as part of a mission by SpaceX, an American company, to resupply the\nISS, a small mothership was placed in orbit carrying 104 “sprites” (pictured below). Not much larger than a postage\nstamp, these contain all the basic elements of a satellite, such as a radio, aerials, a solar cell and instruments.\nDeveloped as part of a crowd-funded project called KickSat at Cornell University, each sprite cost just $25 in parts.\nTheir launch was free, courtesy of NASA, the American space agency. The sprites were designed to remain in orbit for\na few weeks collecting data before burning up on re-entry. Unfortunately, due to a fault with a timer, the mothership\nfailed to release them before it burned up on re-entry. A second mission is now being planned.\n\nNo going back\n\nDespite that setback, the way ahead for satellite technology is clear. “You can now, with a single chip, create most of\nthe capabilities that you would have found in Sputnik, but, of course, orders of magnitude faster,” says Mason Peck, a\nformer chief technologist at NASA and now a professor at Cornell University.\n\nThe most ambitious project to date is a flock of 28 nanosats, each one three CubeSats in size (ie, 30cm long). These\nwere carried to the ISS in January and released in batches (pictured at the beginning of this article) through a sort of\nsatellite shooter developed by NanoRacks, an American company. These nanosats came from Planet Labs, a firm\nbased in San Francisco. The satellites now take pictures as they scan the Earth more frequently than traditional ones\nand at a fraction of the cost, albeit at a lower resolution.\n\nPlanet Labs, funded modestly with $65m of private investment, says its nanosats provide much of the performance of a\nconventional satellite for a fraction of the cost. That reflects a lot of antiquated technology in the space business, much\nof which can be bettered by the latest off-the-shelf equipment, says Will Marshall, Planet Labs’ boss. There are other\ncost-saving measures. Satellites are usually built in elaborate clean rooms, but Planet Labs assembles its nanosats in\n“clean-enough’” rooms in its downtown offices. The company expects to put another 100 nanosats into orbit in the next\n12 to 18 months.\n\nA few miles away, in another modest San Francisco office, Nanosatisfi is working on its ArduSats. These are open-\nsource platforms and two have already gone up. They will contain an array of sensors and can carry out various\nmissions, such as locating things. More than 250,000 ships, for instance, now broadcast an automatic identification\nsignal than carries about 50 nautical miles. A fleet of small satellites in low orbit could pick up these signals and provide\nfrequent updates about the ships’ positions without the vessels having to use costly dedicated satellite uplinks. Such a\nsystem might have been able to track Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, which went missing in March.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028509\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

And we strongly feel this practical perspective is important: Without this concreteness, it’s\ntoo easy for AGI research to get distracted by appealing (or frightening) abstractions of various\nsorts. However, it’s also important to look at the nature of mind and intelligence from a more\ngeneral and conceptual perspective, to avoid falling into an approach that follows the particulars\nof human capability but ignores the deeper structures and dynamics of mind that ultimately\nallow human minds to be so capable. In this chapter we very briefly review some ideas from the\npatternist philosophy of mind, a general conceptual framework on intelligence which has\nbeen inspirational for many key aspects of the CogPrime design, and which has been ongoingly\ndeveloped by one of the authors (Ben Goertzel) during the last two decades (in a series of\npublications beginning in 1991, most recently The Hidden Pattern |[Goe06al). Some of the ideas\ndescribed are quite broad and conceptual, and are related to CogPrime only via serving as\ngeneral inspirations; others are more concrete and technical, and are actually utilized within\nthe design itself.\n\nCogPrime is an integrative design formed via the combination of a number of different\nphilosophical, scientific and engineering ideas. The success or failure of the design doesn’t depend\non any particular philosophical understanding of intelligence. In that sense, the more abstract\nnotions presented in this chapter should be considered “optional” rather than critical in a\nCogPrime context. However, due to the core role patternism has played in the development of\nCogPrime, understanding a few things about general patternist philosophy will be helpful for\nunderstanding CogPrime, even for those readers who are not philosophically inclined. Those\nreaders who are philosophically inclined, on the other hand, are urged to read The Hidden\nPattern and then interpret the particulars of CogPrime in this light.\n\n3.2 Some Patternist Principles\n\nThe patternist philosophy of mind is a general approach to thinking about intelligent systems.\nIt is based on the very simple premise that mind is made of pattern — and that a mind is a\n\n35\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012951\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

That\nwould shut down the whole operation—the Special Counsel staff and\ngrand juries. There might, however, according to research the team has\nprepared, be enough time between the order and the shuttering for the\nSpecial Counsel to share the grand jury evidence with other federal\nprosecutors.\n\nThe President's constitutional pardon powers appear to be some\nof the most troubling and threatening issues for the Special Counsel.

The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I’ve just been. You will never\nthink the same way about anything again.”\n\nSo spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up everywhere at the moment\nas the alleged “procurer” of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEpstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of another\ninvestigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with allegations that he molested\nthem when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British newspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein’s\nfriendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to publicly disassociate himself from his old pal.\n\nI wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called “The Talented Mr. Epstein.” It was largely a business piece that focused on his\nmysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les Wexner, the chairman of Limited\nBrands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail\nsentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of $450 million.\n\nThe piece alluded to Epstein’s great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women with whom he had\nsexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn’t really go there, focusing instead on the issue that remains a mystery—how\nJeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers.\n\nThis is not to say I didn’t hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on the intriguing\nfinancial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same ones, different ones. And their stories are bone-\nchilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one case, flown—to ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he?\nAnd the British, especially, want to know: Who is she? At this point, Iam so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all,\nmy 2003 Vanity Fairstory that really brought him into the limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030420\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Though\nviolence accounts for between 40-55% of all deaths in these two groups, attackers appeared immune to\ninjury, with no more than 5% dying in battle, and often no deaths at all. Chimpanzee attackers are\nlikewise immune to injury, due in large part to the strategic use of imbalances of power.\n\nThe parallels between chimpanzees and humans living in small scale societies supports the idea\nthat similar pressures favored the capacity for coalitionary killing in both species. Does this mean that\neach of these species should always kill in this way, and thus, as argued by Ferguson, the archaeological\nrecord should be chock full of deaths by coalitionary attackers? To argue for this position is to\nmisunderstand the nature of an adaptation, and the arguments put forth by Wrangham as well as the\nevolutionary psychologists Martin Daly, Margo Wilson, and David Buss. As I discussed earlier on in this\nchapter, adaptations are contingent upon particular environmental circumstances. What is adaptive today\nneed not be tomorrow. This is why it is not only unsurprising to see variation in the frequency of\ncoalitionary killing among chimpanzee sites, among humans living in small scale societies, and among\nmodern day humans who sometimes kill their spouses, stepchildren, and rivals, but predicted by\nevolutionary theory. Adaptations are economically efficient solutions to particular social or ecological\nproblems. If those problems or pressures change, the original adaptation may have no impact on survival\nor a negative impact. A hiatus in the archaeological record — assuming this is the last word — is\ninteresting with respect to the conditions that might favor or select against coalitionary killing, but in no\nway undermines the logic of an evolutionary adaptation, one shared by chimpanzees and humans.\n\nThe second camp arguing against the parallels between humans and chimpanzees is defended by\nthe economist Samuel Bowles and his colleagues. Unlike the anthropologists, Bowles is entirely\nsympathetic to biology but sees fundamental differences in the pattern of human killing and warfare. To\nexplain these differences he invokes two important attributes of human societies that have only weak\nparallels in other species: large scale cooperation with unrelated others from the same group, together\nwith hatred, symbolic labeling, and the motivation to hurt all others outside the group. These two factors,\nwhat Bowles calls parechial altruism, may have paradoxically generated both greater levels of\ncooperation within groups and higher rates of warfare between groups. Those groups with the best\ncooperators acquired the greatest resources and experienced the fewest losses due to cheaters and other\nmorally corrosive rogues. This power and inward-looking favoritism led to self-defensive emotions and\nbehaviors, ultimately leading to lethal aggression toward those with different beliefs and values. Thus\nparochialism and altruism co-evolved, hand in hand, breeding prejudice as a result of group safety. This\nevolutionary handshake resulted in warfare and our unique capacity as killers.\n\nBowles’ analysis is interesting and consistent with my explanation of how we evolved the\n\nHauser Chapter 1.

A grant of $10.1 million was\nawarded to ViaCyte Inc. to continue preclinical research and initiate clinical testing of an embryonic stem cell-based therapy for patients\nwith insulin-dependent diabetes.\n\nMeanwhile, Bluebird Bio Inc. will use a $9.3 million grant to support a Phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LentiGlobin,\nthe company’s programme for the treatment of the inherited blood disorder beta-thalassemia, which will be initiated in the US in 2013.\nStemCells Inc. has been awarded up to $20 million to fund preclinical development of its product consisting of purified human neural\nstem cells for treating Alzheimer's disease, with the goal of filing for permission to carry out a clinical trial in that time. In July, CIRM\napproved a separate award to the company for up to $20 million to fund preclinical development of a cell therapy for spinal cord injury.\nPublic Markets\n\nIt has been a good year for stem cell companies on the public markets, with the thirteen publicly-listed stem cell companies showing an\naverage increase in share price of 11.6 percent in the year-to-date.\n\nThis boost came from a regulatory approval and positive clinical trials results. It was a big breakthrough for the field as a whole when\nthe Canadian regulator Health Canada approved Prochymal, Osiris Therapeutics Inc.'s allogeneic stem cell treatment for graft-vs.-host\ndisease (GvHD) in children.\n\nThe decision marked the world's first regulatory approval of a manufactured stem cell product and the first therapy approved for GVHD\n— a devastating complication of bone marrow transplantation that kills up to 80 percent of children affected, many within just weeks of\ndiagnosis. The company’s stock value has almost doubled in the course of this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Newark, California-based StemCells, Inc. has seen its shares rise 148 per cent in the year to date. In addition to its CIRM\ngrants, the company recently reported clinical and preclinical data demonstrating the therapeutic potential of a cell therapy for treating\nmyelination disorders.\n\nPluristem Therapeutics Inc.’s stock value also has jumped 44 per cent, on the strength of reporting a single case study in which a\npatient with aplastic bone marrow who received an intramuscular injection of its PLacental expanded cells under compassionate use\nsaw an improvement. The company was also able to successfully complete a public offering which netted about US$30 million.\n\nPositive clinical trials will begin to encourage investment\n\nWhile still in their early stages of development - and with clinical trials having only involved a limited number of patients - reports to date\nhave been very promising, and provide further validation for encouraging investment in stem cell therapeutics. For example, data from a\nhuman embryonic stem cell trial conducted by Advanced Cell Technology and published in medical journal The Lancet, showed that\ntwo patients with Stargardt’s disease, a degenerative eye condition, had regained some vision.\n\nIn addition, positive early data from a spinal cord injury trial involving StemCells’ neural stem cells indicated that two patients with no\nfeeling below the site of injury were able to regain sensation, while in another study from the company, patients with a rare myelination\ndisorder were able to create myelin, an advance that holds promise for treating multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy.\n\nThis scientific progress has helped breath a new sense of optimism into the US stem cell sector.

One example we will use fairly frequently is\ndrawn from the preschool context: the somewhat open-ended task of Build me something\nout of blocks, that you haven’t built for me before, and then tell me what it is. This\nis a relatively simple task that combines multiple aspects of cognition in a richly interconnected\nway, and is the sort of thing that young children will naturally do in a preschool setting.\n\n2.5 Integrative and Synergetic Approaches to Artificial General\nIntelligence\n\nIn Chapter 1 we characterized CogPrime as an integrative approach. And we suggest that the\nnaturalness of integrative approaches to AGI follows directly from comparing above lists of\ncapabilities and criteria to the array of available AI technologies. No single known algorithm\nor data structure appears easily capable of carrying out all these functions, so if one wants\nto proceed now with creating a general intelligence that is even vaguely humanlike, one must\nintegrate various AI technologies within some sort of unifying architecture.\n\nFor this reason and others, an increasing amount of work in the AI community these days\nis integrative in one sense or another. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms integrate proba-\nbilistic reasoning with evolutionary learning [Pel05]. Markov Logic Networks [RD06] integrate\nformal logic and probabilistic inference, as does the Probabilistic Logic Networks framework\n[GIGHO08] utilized in CogPrime and explained further in the book, and other works in the\n“Progic” area such as [WW06]. Leslie Pack Kaelbling has synthesized low-level robotics methods\n(particle filtering) with logical inference [ZPIX07|. Dozens of further examples could be given.\nThe construction of practical robotic systems like the Stanley system that won the DARPA\nGrand Challenge [Tea06] involve the integration of numerous components based on different\nprinciples. These algorithmic and pragmatic innovations provide ample raw materials for the\nconstruction of integrative cognitive architectures and are part of the reason why childlike AGI\nis more approachable now than it was 50 or even 10 years ago.\n\nFurther, many of the cognitive architectures described in the current AI literature are “inte-\ngrative” in the sense of combining multiple, qualitatively different, interoperating algorithms.\nChapter 4 gives a high-level overview of existing cognitive architectures, dividing them into\nsymbolic, emergentist (e.g. neural network) and Aybrid architectures. The hybrid architectures\ngenerally integrate symbolic and neural components, often with multiple subcomponents within\neach of these broad categories. However, we believe that even these excellent architectures are\nnot integrative enough, in the sense that they lack sufficiently rich and nuanced interactions\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012945\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But in the course of conversations\nI've had recently, as al research a new book on President Trump and\nthe forces arrayed against him, what has become clear is that Robert\nMueller and his office are preparing for a life or death confrontation\nwith the President and the mother of all constitutional crises.\n\nMy discussions have been with both White House advisors and\npeople close to the investigation. No source involved in this story would\nspeak on the record. But one source allowed me to review some of the\ndocuments related to the Special Counsel's strategy. Aspects of the\nSpecial Counsel's strategy have been confirmed by both White House\nsources and lawyers closely involved with the Justice Department.\n\nSince at least April the Special Counsel has had in place proposed\ncharges, a bill of particulars, and an aggressive legal theory for the\nindictment of the president for obstruction of Justice. In the last few\nweeks, as the President has indulged his pardon authority, the Mueller\nteam has also developed a legal strategy to oppose what the Special\nCounsel believes will be a likely pardon of former National Security\nAdvisor, Michael Flynn, who had previously struck a plea bargain which\ncould include his testimony against the President.\n\nRobert Mueller, according to one person familiar with the Special\nCounsel's thinking, could hardly contain his disgust when Rudy Giuliani,\nthe President's new lawyer—hired to makes a television case for the\nPresident and to push back against the Mueller team—in May airily\ndismissed the notion that a president can be indicted. Adding insult to\ninjury, Giuliani—who a White House source said had likely learned of\naspects of the pending indictment—said Mueller agreed with that\nassessment. White House sources believe Giuliani was daring the\nSpecial Counsel to tip his hand. Mueller, in character, contained his\noutrage and continued to hold his cards close as his team finished\npreparing the obstruction case and refined the legal theories under\nwhich it would claim the right to haul the president into court.\n\nAt this point, the case for indictment has, in effect, a judge of one.\nThe Mueller team, according to sources both near the investigation and\nthe White House, has prepared the case, but it requires the approval of\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who—with the recusal of\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions from the Russia-related investigation—\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029165\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The streets are unusually clean; the\nsurveillance cameras unusually - even for Beijing - dense. The neighborhood is\nhome to many of the last of the generation of Communist Party cadres who joined\nand supported its rise decades ago. Several years ago, I found myself settled into one\nof them for an afternoon tea with Huang Hua, one of the great modern Chinese\nforeign policy figures - and a member of that early revolutionary generation. Huang\nwas, in a sense, heir to the Warring States diplomat Su Qin, whom Master Nan had\nencouraged me to study. Huang had penetrated the madness of Mao’s revolutionary\nera to see the possibility of a different order, one he’d brought to vivid life after\nDeng Xiaoping ascended to the Chinese leadership in 1976. Huang had been the\ncountry’s Foreign Minister and later a Vice Premier. He was always calm, with an\neasy and relaxed temperament. One of my favorite images of him was from the mid-\n1970s when, while sitting on a flight to the US from Paris to take China’s seat at the\nUnited Nations, he was ambushed by Walter Cronkite. Huang is completely\nunflustered in the scratchy video of that encounter. He sits quietly in a cloud of\nsmoke. Cronkite pesters him. Huang smiles, offers a cigarette to the news crew, and\nthough he is in the midst of a transit from the poverty, chaos and smashed politics of\nChina he is nothing but serene, a statesman - not the nervous representative ofa\ntwitchy power.\n\n“Do you know the difference between Western and Chinese thinking?” Huang asked\nthat afternoon as we sat inside his courtyard house. Leaves were turning outside. He\nwas in his early 90s then, still tack-sharp. “You see, when Chinese want to do\nsomething, we begin with the question: What is the nature of the age? Westerners\nbegin with the goal. What do they aim to achieve?” Deng’s foreign policy, one Huang\nshaped and executed, had been an excellent example. Mao, who ruled China from\n1949 until 1976, had a darting, paranoid, murderously strategic temperament. The\nnature of his age, he was convinced in his Marx-addled mind, was one of zhanzheng\nyu geming - war and revolution. From this first principle, everything followed: He\nhoneycombed Beijing with bomb-proof tunnels, relocated Chinese industry to\nisolated and gaspingly poor mountain strongholds, reacted to foreign ideas or\ninfluence with a snapping electricity - and was bent on protective isolation as he\ndragged the country through one impossible and failed isolationist development\ninitiative after another.\n\nDeng, when he came to power in 1977, read the nature of his age too. He read it\ndifferently. “There is no possibility of a great war. Don’t be afraid of it, there is no\n\nrisk of it,” he assured a group of Chinese cadres during a chat in 1983. The cadres\nwere having a hard time replacing their Maoist paranoia with confidence that China\n\n167\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018399\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Saudi High Commission‘\n\nIn 1993, then-King Fahad bin Abdulaziz Al—-Saud, the\nPresident of the Council of *548 Ministers of Saudi\nArabia, decreed the formation of SHC, also known as the\nSaudi High Relief Commission, by High Order 17419.\n(Ashton Compl. J 446; Burnett Compl. J 392; Federal\nCompl. § 180; see also SHC Mem. in Sup. Mot. to\nDismiss at 3.) The same High Order named Defendant\nPrince Salman the President of SHC. (Ashton Compl. J\n446; Burnett Compl. J 392; SHC Mem. in Sup. Mot. to\nDismiss at 3.)\n\nSHC allegedly has contributed $600 million to aid\n“Bosnian Muslims impoverished by the country’s recent\ncivil war.” (Ashton Compl. J 446; Burnett Compl. J 392.)\nPlaintiffs claim, however, that SHC does not provide\nsupport to the needy but actually diverts funds for terrorist\nactivities. (Ashton Compl. 7 454; Burnett Compl. § 404.)\nIn support, Plaintiffs allege that Prince Salman received a\nletter in September 2000 from a Bosnian association\nclaiming SHC did not provide charitable assistance, and\nthat none of the money collected after the fall of\nSrebrenica in July 1995 actually reached the Srebrenican\npeople. (Ashton Compl. J§ 454-55; Burnett Com pl. TF\n404-05; Federal Compl. JJ 185, 457.) Plaintiffs claim\n\nWESTLAW\n\nSHC’s financial records fail to account for $41 million.\n(Ashton Compl. J 456; Burnett Compl. § 407; Federal\nCompl. J 460.) SHC allegedly made donations to charity\nDefendant Taibah and the bin Laden Establishment.\n(Ashton Compl. JJ 376, 462 (relying on 1995 bin Laden\ninterview); Burnett Compl. J 298.) Plaintiffs also claim\nthat SHC is responsible for “importing the extreme form\nof Saudi Islam, Wahhabism” to Bosnia. (Ashton Compl. J\n447; Burnett Compl. § 393.)\n\nThe Federal Plaintiffs allege that al Qaeda fighters began\nentering Bosnia—Herzegovina in 1992 disguised as SHC\nrelief workers. (Federal Compl. J 183.) On October 21,\n2001, a group of Algerians who were supposedly part of\nthe al Qaeda network were arrested in Bosnia\nHerzegovina on charges of terrorism directed at the\nUnited States embassy. (Ashton Compl. Jf 448-49;\nBurnett Compl. J§ 394-95.) One of the arrested, Sabir\nLamar, apparently worked for SHC as an Arabic language\nteacher. (Ashton Compl. J 450; Burnett Compl. J 396.)\nAlso in October 2001, Plaintiffs claim that United States\nforces raided the Sarajevo branch of SHC and “found\ncomputer hard drives with photographs of the World\nTrade Center before and after its collapse as well as\nphotos of United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania\nand the U.S.S. Cole.” (Ashton Compl. J 451; Burnett\nCompl. J 397; Federal Compl. J § 186, 458.) The U.S.\nforces also apparently found files on pesticides and crop\ndusters, the locations of Washington government\nbuildings, fake State Department badges, and cash.\n(Ashton Compl. Ff 451, 453; Burnett Compl. FF 397, 399;\nFederal Compl. §§ 186, 459.) After the raid, the Financial\nPolice of the Federation of Bosnia Herzegovina Ministry\nof Finance analyzed the seized documents and stated that\nsome did “not belong in the scope of work of a\nhumanitarian organization.” (Federal Compl. Ff 187, 459;\nsee also Ashton Compl. § 452; Burnett Compl. J 398.)\nThe Federal Plaintiffs claim that the SHC “has long acted\nas a fully integrated component of al Qaida’s logistical\nand financial support infrastructure ... [and that the attacks\nof September 11 were] a direct, intended and foreseeable\nproduct of [its] participation in al Qaida’s jihadist\ncampaign.” (Federal Compl. Jf 182, 189.)\n\n*549 2. Prince Salman’\nPrince Salman is a member of the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia’s Council of Ministers, the governor of the\nprovince of Riyadh, and the President of Defendant SHC.\n(Prince Salman Mem. in Sup. Mot. to Dismiss at 2.)\nPlaintiffs allege that Prince Salman provided material\nsupport to Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. (Ashton\nCompl.

But in talking with his wartime friends, he realized this kind of\nlow-level intelligence could never address the real need for Israel: to ensure we\nhad early warning if Syria or Lebanon, Jordan or Egypt, were preparing to go to\nwar against us.\n\nHe began toying with the idea of training a small force of Israeli soldiers to\ngo on cross-border intelligence missions. The initial response from the kirya —\nmilitary headquarters in Tel Aviv — was so frustrating that anyone else would\nhave given up. None of the generals saw any reason to believe his scheme\nwould work. But the real obstacle was their continuing trauma over what had\nhappened the last time Israeli soldiers crossed the border on an intelligence\nmission. It had happened in 1954, and it ended in a failure even more serious\nthan Rotem. The target was the Golan Heights, inside Syria. The special\ntechnology unit attached to military intelligence had developed a bugging\ndevice designed to be placed on a telephone pole on the Golan. The task of\ninstalling it was given to the most decorated, and respected, commando unit in\nthe army: Company A in Sharon’s paratroop battalion, led by its commander,\nMeir Har-Zion.\n\nOn a spring night in 1954, Har-Zion led his team onto the Golan. They\nrigged the bugging unit to the telephone pole, buried the bulky transmitter and\nmade their way back. And it worked. Israeli intelligence could listen in to\nmilitary communications on the Heights. The hitch as that the batteries had to\nbe replaced every few weeks. Several more times, Meir and his men sneaked\nback into Syria to keep the bug working. But as commander of Company A,\nMeir was a key part of Israel’s anti-fedayeen operations. The last thing Moshe\nDayan wanted to risk was seeing him captured while trying to replace a few\nbatteries. So he shifted the task to a regular unit from the Golani Brigade.\n\nIn December 1954, a handover mission was organized. Three men from\nCompany A, including one of Meir’s sergeants, joined three from the Golani\nBrigade. But they didn’t even hold a joint exercise before setting off. There was\nalso a lack of clarity about who was in charge. Though the Golani commander\nwas nominally the senior officer, only the Company A men had any first-hand\nexperience of this kind of mission. A half-mile onto the Heights, they were\nintercepted by a Syrian soldiers. If this had been a Company A operation, the\nresponse would have been automatic. They would have wheeled, opened fire\nand attacked. But when the Syrians ordered the Golanis to drop their weapons,\none of them did, and the Company A men followed suit. They were all taken to\nDamascus, held in solitary confinement, beaten and tortured.\n\no/7\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027905\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Recovery (we look a\nmodest acceleration in both growth and inflation) and Rotation go hand in hand. On the\nbasis of our central forecasts for growth, inflation and rates and given the moves in the\nmarket already we think that the pace of the rotation has to moderate. (In-line with that\nwe recently downgraded of banks and miners).\n\nReversal refers to the ECB. Our economists are not yet convinced that the ECB will\nstart to unwind loose policy 2017 but the probability is increasing. An ECB that tapers\nbecause growth and inflation are improving would be supportive for markets, notably\nbanks. But tapering because the ability or willingness to do QE fades would likely cause\na setback. Relief or Revolt relates to European politics. Will Europe follow the route to\npopulism (revolt from the voters) or will we find relief for the markets by the end of\n2017 from a Fillon/Merkel duo being in charge of the Euro area’s two largest\neconomies. We think investors will demand a higher risk premium until the French\nElections in May 2017\n\nValuation are reasonable at 14x PE but Europe is cheap on a relative basis and the\nvaluation overhang remains evident in the region’s equity risk premium, which\nimplies 11% upside to get back to 5-year average levels. We see a return to positive\nEPS growth (+7%) in Europe for the first time since 2014, as 3.5% global GDP growth\nshould deliver positive earnings growth (supported by Resources recovery, capex\ndiscipline and FX. +7% growth implies less downgrades than usual (10% is the average).\n\nBond yields and equities — stable/higher inflation breakevens are key. Equities can\ncontinue to perform in an environment of higher rates — the key is that inflation\nbreakevens are not falling. However, a more aggressive bond sell-off taking Treasury\nyields to 3% or higher would undermine EM, the growth outlook and risky assets.\n\nThe rotation out of bond proxies and Defensives into Financials and Cyclicals has\nmoved to extreme levels: relative performance of Financials / Cyclicals versus\nDefensives rose over 6SD in 10-14 months. Technical metrics are at historical extremes,\narguing for a moderation in relative returns and a more balanced approach to sector\nallocation is justified right now. Look for another leg to cyclical trades in the New Year.\n\nSectors have also moved a long way already from a valuation perspective.\nFinancials are now trading around median relative valuation levels. Healthcare PE\nrelative is at the bottom of the historical range and Utilities relative PE is also close to\nthe prior low hit in 2013. Food & Beverage still commands a large premium and PE-\nrelative is 6-10% above the 2010 / 2014 lows.\n\nWe remain cautious on domestic UK exposure. The full impact of sterling weakness\non the UK consumer environment is yet to be felt and Brexit negotiations are likely to\ndrive further uncertainty and FX volatility in our view. Structural issues add to our\nconcerns in Retail and Travel & Leisure (both underweight).\n\nOverweight Oil, Healthcare, Utilities, Media; underweight Food & Beverage. If OPEC\ncuts production and oil recovers up to the high $50s per barrel, Oil sector EPS and cash\nflows can recover significantly and make the highest DY in market (6%) look sustainable.\nHealthcare we believe is too cheap relative to an improving sector growth outlook. 2017\nwill be an important year for newsflow on key pipeline drugs. Evidence of success can\ndrive a re-rating independent of macro. Despite the recent sell-off, among defensives\nand bond proxies Food & Beverage still seems the least attractive. Valuations are among\nthe most expensive in the market and overweight positioning has not corrected\nmaterially yet. We move overweight Media, a wuality cyclical that has lagged badly and\nseen valuations de-rate.\n\nBankofAmerica <2”\n\n2 European Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014461\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Thought it would amuse you. Tell me what you \nthink of it. \nxoxo Peggy \nHD: Wall Street, Take Two \nDEK: In the upcoming sequel to Oliver Stone's groundbreaking film, Gordon Gekko gets out of jail and back \nto business. Peggy Siegal takes us behind the scenes where she got herself on camera along with a few of her \nfamous friends. Nice work if you can get it. \nIn 1987, right after director Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for \"Platoon,\" he immediately turned to a \ndomestic arena and began working on \"Wall Street\" in New York City where his father had been a \nstockbroker. Although the film was widely seen as a scathing critique of the culture of Wall Street, Stone has \nsaid that part of the film is a defense of capitalism, his father's vision of finance (as seen through the Hal \nHolbrook character) and an homage to his father. \nAt the time Oliver was also fascinated with the connection between the psyche of Latino Miami drug dealers \nfrom his earlier \"Scarface\" script and the American-born 28- to 35-year-old, white collar stockbrokers. Both \ngroups had an animalistic need to obtain big and fast money. They shared an obsession with corruption and \ngreed. \nOliver sent his actors to Bear Stearns for research, including then-newcomer Charlie Sheen, who played Bud \nFox, a kid from nowhere. When he learns to cold call, and lands one big client, Gordon Gekko, Fox is thrust \ninto the fast lane with a rock star financial mentor who teaches him corruption. \nOliver needed an old-fashioned villain to create drama, and he cast Michael Douglas as Gekko against type. \nMichael was not known as a heavy at the time, but as a charming, handsome, sensitive leading man. Oliver \nalso saw the anger, confidence, salesmanship and style that Michael brought to the role. Michael's Gekko \nlooked a bit like Laker's coach Pat Riley with his slicked back hair and well-cut suits, and it became Michael's \nmost important role, winning him the Academy Award for the villain no one could ever forget. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021235 \nWhen Gekko delivers his speech, \"Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works,\" \ncinematic history was made. \n\"Wall Street\" was set in 1985, a time before ten financial news networks broadcasting 24/7 existed. The entire \nfinancial services industry was largely unknown and Oliver Stone nailed it. \nFour years ago, Wall Street's producer Ed Pressman decided it was time for a sequel and met with Fox Film \nEntertainment co-chairmen Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos. Michael Douglas was immediately on-board \npending script approval. Steven Schiff wrote the first script before the global economic crash of 2008 rendered \nit obsolete. \nAlan Loeb was brought in for a rewrite. Pressman asked me to meet Loeb at the Carlyle Hotel to explain the \nsocial rhythms of New York's financial high society. Whereas Gekko's character was modeled after '70s junk \nbond kings (Michael Milken) and '80s mergers and acquisitions killers (Henry Kravis), Loeb bases the new \nvillain on hedge fund billionaires like John Paulson and Mike Novogratz, geniuses who have created \nstratospheric wealth beyond Gordon Gekko's wildest dreams. When Oliver Stone agreed to direct, he rewrote a \nportion of the script to focus on bankers as well as hedge funders, taking no screen credit. \nThis past September, Oliver yelled, \"action\" as Gordon Gekko, with long grey hair, comes back to life as he \nemerges from a lengthy prison stint shot outside of Sing Sing in Ossining, New York. Gekko is desperate to \nredefine himself in a different era. The New York Post runs a full-page photo of Gekko and New Yorkers \nimmediately become obsessed with the filming of Wall Street 2. \nA week into shooting, a glorious fall day. Ed Pressman invites me on the set at the Central Park Zoo. Oliver \ndesigns an elaborate tracking shot around the seal pool where Gekko, fresh from jail, walks and talks to Jake \nMoore, a young idealistic investment banker played by Shia LaBoeuf. They discuss Gekko's daughter Winnie, \nMoore's fiancée, played by Carrie Mulligan, who is also having an off-screen romance with LaBoeuf. Oliver \nplayed Cupid. Moore invites Gekko to the Alzheimer's Ball at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Gekko, who \nused to be a sponsor or honoree of such events, cannot even afford a ticket. \nThe shot starts with a barking seal jumping for fish, then pans down to the actors. Extras weave in and out. In \none take Michael makes a wrong turn and ends up at the monkey house. Everyone laughs. The atmosphere on \nthe set is courteous but quick and tense. There is pressure when you are making a sequel to a hit. \nI watch the action on monitors while sitting on the producers' canvas chairs with Pressman, Eric Kopeloff \n(\"Monsters Ball\") and Celia Costas, who was a location manager on the first \"Wall Street.\" They have asked \nme to be an extra in the Alzheimer's Ball scene and bring some friends to play rich Upper East Side socialites. \nOliver wants over the top glam, go-to-the-vault jewels and couture gowns. \"Give me the night before the \nTitanic goes down,\" were his exact words. Not a problem. \nI pay a quick visit to Michael in his trailer on Fifth Avenue where he is resting. We go way back. I was his \npersonal publicist when he won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Actor for \"Wall Street\" and we have \nremained great friends. Gekko is just as challenging for him the second time because of endless pages of \ntechnical financial dialogue. We discuss Catherine Zeta-Jones' Broadway debut in a \"Little Night Music.\" \nMichael has a stack of partially finished handwritten thank you notes next to him for gifts received for \ntheir shared birthday party on September 25th at the St. Regis. Her 40th and his 65th. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021236 \nI tell him I have been cast as an extra in two scenes and he laughs knowing I am desperate to hang around him \nand the production. \n8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 21st, another warm, stunning fall day. I report to the wardrobe trailer on \n65th Street and Madison Avenue. I carry four elaborate cocktail dresses and bags of matching accessories. My \nhair is in rollers. Statuesque Julia Koch walks over from her Park Avenue apartment carrying her white \nValentino and long diamond earrings. Her real-life financial titan husband David is unaware where she is this \nmorning. \nVanity Fair's keeper of the Best Dressed List, Amy Fine Collins, arrives totally organized in turquoise vintage \nGeoffrey Beene, and Vogue's fashion editor Hamish Bowles wears a riot of plaids, patterns and a large yellow \nfake flower on his lapel. Costume Designer Ellen Mirojnick, who created Gordon Gekko's rich slick look in the \nfirst film, is ecstatic with the extras I invited. \nOliver is shooting a scene with Josh Brolin (the star of Stone's \"W\"). His character Bretton (never Bret) \nJames, a ruthless Wall Street kingpin, and his perfect wife Samantha (Noelle Beck) are hosting a benefit piano \nrecital for a 13-year-old child prodigy in their huge, art-filled townhouse at 41 East 65th Street. The building \nactually belongs to Baby Jane Holzer, a wealthy art collector still famous for hanging with Andy Warhol in the \n'60s. The production designer had Jane's fabulous Warhols moved to storage and replaced with matching \nphotographic copies. Very expensive contemporary art is again an important production element of Oliver's \nvision. \nAt 10:30 a.m., all the extras are placed around the living room set. Oliver's French mother, Jacqueline Stone, \nand her friend Monique Van Vooren, both in their 80s, are seated in front of the fireplace chatting in French. \nProduction assistants fuss over them. Debonair macho man Chuck Pfieffer, who appeared in the original film, \nand I immediately invent a back story—I am his corporate wife—and we position ourselves on a couch next to \nthe director's mother. Julia gets the best spot close to the piano and Amy, Hamish and decorator Geoffrey \nBradfield are right behind her. Josh is brought in and the kibitzing stops. \nOliver appears on the set with eagle eyes and a sly grin and quickly re-positions everyone. He explains the \nscene, gives out lines to his favored extras, and on his way out to the monitors in the next room mentions that \nmy earrings are too small. Wardrobe jumps. Josh rehearses and Oliver finally yells, \"Action.\" The kid plays \nthe piano, Josh explains why we are in his home, asks for money, the camera dollies as extras say their lines \nand Shia appears at the door uninvited for a confrontation with Josh. Three hours later a PA yells, \"Lunch\". \nIn costume, Amy, Hamish and I run to The Monkey Bar. I am late to meet \"The Harpies,\" including Liz \nSmith, Barbara Walters, Cynthia McFadden, Nora Ephron, Jennifer Isham, Maury Perl and Beth Kseniak. \nGraydon Carter is at the next table. I tell him Oliver Stone wants him in \"Wall Street 2\" as an extra. (I make \nthis up.) Graydon jokes that he only works with lines. I say, \"Not a problem.\" (This will be news to Oliver.) \nBack on the set I tell Oliver that Graydon is willing to be in the film with lines. Oliver finds that intriguing. \nOliver shoots the piano recital scene over and over again from different angles all afternoon. Financial wizard \nDon Marron saunters on the set to visit and Oliver spontaneously puts him in a scene chatting with Josh. Carrie \nMulligan hangs out watching boyfriend Shia work. \nAt sundown Julia Koch has to race from reel to real life and explain to her husband where she has been all day. \n(He loves it.) \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021237 \nChuck Pfieffer plants a \"Page Six\" item and the next day socialites begin calling me to get into the film. \nThursday, November 5, Shun Lee Restaurant, West 65th Street \nOliver shoots a crowded tight interior scene with Michael, Carrie and Shia, who are having an intimate \nChinese dinner. Spontaneously, Oliver decides this is the perfect scene for Graydon Carter. After a flurry of \ncalls, Graydon arrives on set, and playing himself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and \nGraydon brushes him off with a few dismissive lines. \nMonday, November 9, 25 Broadway \nOne hundred swells show up at the former Canard Shipping building, a massive Italianate hall, at the crack of \ndawn for the Alzheimer's Ball, a grand charity event. \nSusan Hess and I are chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding \narea where we join Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason, \nsongstress Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly Klein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in \nsee-through Rodarte, beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille, producer Lawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld \nDrake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN's Felicia Taylor and Italian \nnewsman Mario Calvo-Platero. \nEllen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer \ngowns and work at break neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area. \nEllen pours me into a black tulle Marchesa with a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-\nup artists systematically work on 250 extras. A mile of tables are alternately filled with steaming coffee, \nfattening breakfast foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It's a madhouse of excitement. \nWe are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie \nSheen stand-ins. Charlie has been flown in from LA for half a day's work to reprise his original character. He \nis now the highest paid television actor commanding two million dollars an episode of \"Two and a Half Men.\" \nOliver arrives on the set greeting, examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to \nthe camera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight \nlines challenging their concentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells, \"Action\" as the extras aggressively \njockey for face time. Charlie is not having an easy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband \nChuck Pfieffer has gotten his real girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and my marriage has become a threesome. \nSensing our concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to seat a \ndinner table with Susan Hess, Jill Fairchild, Prince Dimitri, Chuck Pfieffer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-\nPlatero. He directs us to chat with each other turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces. \nElsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old \nEli Wallach and Natalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langella, as Shia's boss, who \nthrows himself in front of a train early in the film, Susan Sarandon as Shia's real-estate broker mother, Sylvia \nMiles, who reprises her hilarious cameo as another real-estate agent and Jean Pigozzi as an international \nbanker. \nLunch is called at 4 p.m. and Michael Douglas takes seven heavily made-up and bejeweled women including \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021238 \nSusan, Jill and me to a restaurant around the corner. Gordon Gekko hosts a hen party talking about children, \nschools, country houses and vacations. \nBack on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live \nmusic. Prince Dimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza, \nwatches from a table with scattered champagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old \nfather, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and Shia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his \nhero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between takes. \nThe final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is \nclose to 9 p.m. and Lord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner \nfor artists uptown. \nOliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of \nthe shot and instructs him to tell Eli Wallach, \"We must do lunch\". Ever the proper English gentleman, \nWilliam advises Oliver that Lords do not use American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot \ncontinues for numerous takes following Josh and NoeIle as every VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom \nwith one-line greetings. \nAt last, \"It's a wrap\" is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, \"a day of \nelectrifying glamour,\" and \"the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours.\" \nNovember 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting \nDonald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet \nfrom Teterboro with wife Melania and son Baron for Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Beach. Back in \nSeptember, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to dinner at \"21\" to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they \ncould observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural environment. \nThe scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial \ncomeback. The scene opens on the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV. \nThe camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is finally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite \nsuit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the shop for a cut and the banter begins about \nthe money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a \"comb over\" like his famous \ndo. Gekko, with a slight grin, says, \"No thanks Donald, I am a gel man.\" \nThe crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across \nthe street. The unit publicist is helpless to keep this under wraps. Donald emerges, poses and gives interviews. \nMichael comes out, and the press think they have a scoop on the ending. Gekko is back in all his lovable titan \nsplendor. Full-page photos of Michael and Donald run the next day in the tabloids. Never underestimate Oliver \nStone's surprise endings. \nTwentieth Century Fox releases \"Wall Street 2: The Money Never Sleeps\" on April 23rd and it's got hit written \nall over it. \n--\n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021239 \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

For\nconvenience, this Article discusses the proposed changes sequentially, beginning with Rule 1.\n\nRule 1 - Definition of \"Victim\"\nThe Proposal:\nRule 1 should be amended to include the following definition of a victim:\n\n\"Victim\" means a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a federal offense or an offense in the\nDistrict of Columbia. In the case of a crime victim who is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the\nlegal guardians of the crime victim or the representatives of the crime victim's estate, family members, or any other persons\nappointed as [*857] suitable by the court, may assume the crime victim's rights under these rules, but in no event shall the\ndefendant be named as such guardian or representative.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nThe CVRA directly defines \"victim\" using this language, !2° which ought to be folded into the rules for convenience. The\nrules currently define such terms as \"attorney for the government,\" \"federal judge,\" and \"petty offense.\" !*! \"Victim\" should\nlikewise be defined.\n\nA definition is required for a second reason: Rule 32 currently contains a differing definition of \"victim\" as \"an individual\nagainst whom the defendant committed an offense for which the court will impose sentence.\" !2? Because that definition varies\nfrom that mandated by the CVRA, it must be changed. Furthermore, the CVRA's definition comes with an interpretative\nhistory. '?? The CVRA's definition of \"victim\" is taken almost verbatim from the 1996 Mandatory Victims Restitution Act\n(MVRA). !?4 In tum, the MVRA drew on the 1982 Victim Witness Protection Act (VWPA). !?> As a result, the CVRA uses a\ndefinition of \"victim\" that is more than twenty-two years old and that has not produced major administrative or definitional\n\nproblems. Courts will be able to draw from that history to determine who qualifies as a \"victim.\" 17°\n\n20 18 U.S.C.A. 3771(e) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).\n\n21 See Fed. R. Crim.

United States, 495 U.S. 411 (1990) (holding that VWPA limited \"victim\" to victims of the actual offense of\nconviction so that district court could not order restitution on basis of charges that were dropped as part of plea agreement); United States v.\nFollet, 269 F.3d 996 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that a free clinic was not a \"victim\" of the defendant's rape of his niece); Moore v. United\nStates, 178 F.3d 994 (Sth Cir. 1999) (holding that a bank customer was \"victim\" of attempted bank robbery under MVRA where defendant\npointed a sawed-off shotgun at the customer and the teller, who were standing only two feet apart, while demanding money), cert. denied,\n528 U.S. 943 (1999); United States v. Sanga, 967 F.2d 1332 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that foreign national who conspired to be brought into\nUnited States illegally was still a \"victim\" of the conspiracy where her smuggler threatened her life and forced her to work as live-in maid\nonce she had arrived); United States v. Bedonie, 317 F. Supp. 2d 1285 (D. Utah 2004) (holding that \"victim\" in manslaughter case under\nMVRA was murdered person himself and not the estate), rev'd on other grounds, United States v.

We then\ndivide that implied value by future performance fee earn-\nings, to determine the implied multiple that the market is\npaying for this earings stream. This is the groundwork for\nour upside and downside scenarios if the alts were to\nconvert to C-corps.\n\nWe simplify our the SOTP and standardize it across the group to\nlook at &4 main components. 1) after-tax core fee-related earnings,\n2) balance sheet value of investments plus net cash/debt, 3) net\naccrued carry balance, and &) future value of performance fees. The\nvalues of the balance sheet and net accrued carry receivable are\nstatic items with balances as of 3Q17. We then adjust the multiple on\nour core FRE to determine a value for what we believe the street is\nusing. To be conservative, we use 15x as a starting point for what we\nbelieve is currently priced in. We then take the current share price\nand subtract out the value of the FRE, net accrued carry performance\nfees and the balance sheet and we are left with an implied value of\nwhat the marketis pricing in for future carry. Once we have the future\ncarry value, we divide by the net performance fee earnings per share\nfor each company and get an implied multiple on the future perform-\nance fees. Using this approach and a 15x multiple on FRE, we see the\n\nmarket is valuing future performance fees at 7.5x on average anda\n\nWe make several key adjustments in the SOTP valuations: First,\nwe use our own Morgan Stanley definition of \"core fee-related earn-\nings\" in our calculation. We use our core approach as we attempt to\nnormalize the various definitions of FRE across the companies. The\nmain difference vs. company-reported FRE is that we fully burden all\nexpenses, including equity-based compensation. KKR differs the\nmost on company-reported vs. MS Core FRE. For more information\n\non our core FRE methodology, please see our note Alternative Asset\n\nManagers: Who@Got Swimsuits? (19 May 2016).\n\nWe also make adjustments for ARES an OAK. For Ares: a signifi-\ncant portion of the fee related earnings come from Part 1 BDC fees.\nThese are investment income sharing fees from their management\nagreement with ARCC. In the MS approach, we value these sepa-\nrately from more traditional management fees. However, we do not\nbelieve that the market looks at the fees this way, and so we include\nthem in the total FRE by using the same multiple as we are using for\nFRE (15x). For presentation purposes in the table below, we break out\nthe BDC Part 1 fees separately for ARES to show the value. OAK: We\nadjust the balance of OAK@investments on balance sheet to account\nfor OAK© 20% ownership stake in DoubleLine which it currently\nholds at cost of $21m as adjusted under the equity method of\naccounting. With the benefit of lower corporate taxes we currently\nvalue OAK@ownership stake at $1B. We do not believe the market\n\ngives full value for this 20% ownership and haircut our MSe value by\n\nmedian 6.5x. 50% to $500m. We then add this value to the balance of investments\nand net cash for OAK@total balance sheet value.\nExhibit 27:\n\nMarket Implied Value of Future Carry at current share price and 15x FRE multiple\n= B+C+D =A-E-F =E+F+G Son |\nA B (a D E F G H I J |\nI I I l\nvena ne After-Tax SOTP _ Pre-Tax Net | vere Total | Pre-Tax Avg.

The\nbiologists John Maynard Smith and Eors Szathmary, in their masterwork The Major\nTransitions in Evolution, chronicle the miraculous march of life towards ever-greater\ncomplexity — from cells to humans to societies - as a story of ceaseless, successful\nco-evolution. “Complexity is hard to define or to measure,” they write. “But there is\nsurely some sense in which elephants and oak trees are more complex than bacteria,\nand bacteria than the first replicating molecules.” The essential, facilitating feature\nof our biological hop-scotch from mitochondrial snot to Beethoven sonatas has been\nan ability to change together, not merely to compete. While we humans tend to\nconsider evolution in murderous you win/I lose Darwinian terms, the biological\nworld around us seethes with a more nuanced logic: Cooperation is every bit as\nimportant to survival.\n\nSmith and Szathmary identified eight major transitions in their work - the evolution\nfrom single cell to multiple cell organisms, for instance. And in each case they find a\nkind of cooperative, co-evolving logic serving a catalyst to survival. “The\napplicability of the concept,” Smith and Szathmary conclude, “extends across the\nwhole of social and natural sciences.” Inside cells.

Hong Kong should benefit\nfrom China's gradual recovery in 2H 2012, while Singapore's economy is rebounding and corporate\nbalance sheets and earnings remain solid. After the rate cut early June, we expect China to have more\npolicies to support growth in 2H 2012. China is our most preferred market, while Indonesia is least\npreferred in the region. We are more concerned about Indonesia's fiscal deficit, since the fuel price hike\ndid not happen. Domestic problems for Indonesia include current account deficits, potential capital\noutflows, bottomed-out inflation and hiccups in economic and market reforms, in our view.\n¢ We expect 10% earnings-per-share growth over 12 months for the MSCI Asia ex-Japan, which trades on\n11.6x 12-month trailing earnings. We expect this multiple to expand slightly in the next six months, as the\ncurrent earnings downgrade cycle is approaching its end. Nevertheless, MSCI Asia ex-Japan is likely to see\nfurther volatility in the near term due to global macro risk factors.\n\n@ Positive scenario MSCI Asia ex-Japan (6-month target): 610\n\n¢ More supportive monetary and fiscal policy, stable inflation, sustained domestic demand growth, and an\nimproved global growth outlook should lead to a better earnings outlook. We would expect earnings\ngrowth of 15% and a P/E based on realized earnings of 14x.\n\n4 Negative scenario MSCI APAC ex-Japan (6-month target): 380\ne Ahard landing in China with a global recession leads to negative earnings revisions for 2012. In this\n\nscenario, earnings could fall 20% over 12 months and the P/E could fall to about 10.5x.\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nGrowth Both HK and Singapore's GDP growth disappointed, raising concerns about the\ngrowth momentum in the region.

In the near term, we expect that cultivators will con-\ntinue to raise capital for facilities across multiple jurisdictions, and well-managed and well-financed\ncultivators will differentiate themselves by creating consistent, high-quality strains, developing strong\ndistribution relationships, vertically integrating other supply-chain functions and offering branded\nproducts and competitive pricing. We also expect production services companies will benefit from\nincreasing demand for specialized extraction and manufacturing services that cultivators and other\nproduction intermediaries cannot efficiently perform themselves, and providers of testing services will\nbenefit from increasingly robust testing and safety regulations. In the long run, we expect more per-\nmissive domestic and foreign laws will result in increased competition from large enterprises that are\nable to realize economies of scale or have operations in regions best suited for efficient, sustainable\nproduction.\n\n= Distribution\n\nWe divide the distribution segment of the cannabis industry into three subsegments: dispensaries,\ne-commerce and distribution services. Dispensaries are retail outlets where consumers purchase can-\nnabis products for medical or recreational purposes. E-commerce includes digital applications used to\nenhance the cannabis shopping experience. Distribution services include wholesale and related trans-\nportation and logistics services. Participants in the distribution segment generally “touch the plant”\nand therefore must comply with state and local regulations—which often require licenses or permits—\nand must accept legal risks related to federal cannabis restrictions.\n\nDispensaries\n\nCannabis dispensaries are “point of sale” retail establishments where consumers may purchase medical\nor recreational cannabis products. Cannabis dispensaries are the face of the cannabis industry in many\ncommunities and, consequently, they occupy one of the most heavily regulated and scrutinized posi-\ntions in the cannabis supply chain.\n\nDispensaries in established state-legal markets provide consumers with a typical retail shopping\nexperience. Dispensaries typically range in size from 1,000 to 10,000 square feet of retail space. A dis-\npensary may offer between 10 to 50 strains of cannabis flower and a variety of concentrates, edibles,\ntopicals and accessories. Inventory is either acquired from cultivators and other wholesale product\nsuppliers, or cultivated and produced internally. Products may be illustrated in menus or displayed on\nshelves and may also be available for customers to touch, smell or otherwise examine. Trained customer\nservice staff, often known as “budtenders,” are typically available to educate customers about product\nofferings.\n\n40 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024676\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

A nuclear weapon three hours\nfrom landing and one that is three months away are, nearly, a different object\nentirely. Adam Smiths’s famous remark in his Theory of Moral Sentiments that most\npeople would be more perturbed by the loss of half a finger than the news that a\nmillion Chinese had perished, begins to take on a different color in an age when a\nbillion and a half Chinese are nanoseconds away.2°? When we say that connection\nchanges the nature of an object, we mean this; Networks change the “locational\nutility” of anything they touch. When connection makes an object instantly, clearly\nvisible, it revolutionizes its potential. Little wonder so many great fortunes are being\nmade in applying this trick of plugging goods into compression engines like apps or\nmatching services. It’s hard to know if firms like Airbnb or Uber will be around ina\ndecade, but the economic energy they release emerges right out of Janelle’s theories:\nConnect a car seat or an empty room and you change its nature. You give it value.\nPart of our unease now - and part of the problem we have in strategizing about the\nworld or our businesses - is that stability on our topological maps is some time off\nyet. There is so much yet to be connected. So many new topologies to be built.\n\n“Time is a ride,” Danny Hillis once remarked in an early meditation about his rock-\nsunk clock, “and you are on it.”2°4 He was right. That ride takes place, in a connected\nage, on topological rails. And just how “instant” you are will be a mark of what sort\nof ride you're on. In the same way that rivers and oceans and mountains define\ndifferent landscapes in real geographies, topological neighborhoods too will each\nbounce with funny quirks. Some will be super fast. Others yoked by politics. Citizens\nof Santa Fe or Mumbai may choose to compress time in different ways. But they will\nall share a common desire. To do more with less. The German philosopher Peter\nSloterdjik, writing about the way in which some people breeze through airports and\nborders (with first class tickets and pre-approved immigration) while others\nstruggle to move at all out of refugee camps or poverty traps, has labeled the\nwinners of this new order as a kind of “kinetic elite”2°5. They are a kind of temporal\nelite, in possession of golden keys to a special, frictionless topology. The technology\nto eliminate space and capture time.\n\n202 He labeled it: Donald G.

What changed since we split off from our ape\ncousins is both the overall geometry of the brain in terms of the relative size of different components, as\nwell as the connections both within and between these components. Some of the most spectacular\nchanges evolved within the frontal and temporal lobes, as well as their connections to other areas of the\nbrain involved in the control of emotion and stress. These circuits play a critical role in decision making,\nself control, short-term memory, social relationships, tool use and language.\n\nFor detail, and further evidence of the importance of connectivity in promiscuous thinking, we\nturn to brain imaging studies of healthy adults, developing children, and patient populations that lack the\nsignature of promiscuity. Consider tool use. Though a wide variety of nonhuman animals use tools, only\nhumans create tools that combine different materials, have multiple functioning parts, can be used for\nfunctions other than the one originally designed, and function in the context of survival, reproduction, and\nleisure. These properties are the signature of a promiscuous brain. When we look at the material culture of\nthe most sophisticated animal tool user — the chimpanzee — we see tools that use a single material, have\nonly a single functional part, are only designed for one function, and the function set is strictly limited to\nsurvival or reproduction. Something as simple as a pencil, beyond the chimpanzees’ wildest imagination,\nconsists of multiple materials (rubber, wood, lead, metal), was designed for writing but can be used for\npoking or keeping hair up in a bun, and has two functional parts (lead for writing, rubber for erasing).\nWhen you put a human subject in a brain scanner and record activity during observations of tool use,\nwhat you see is an orchestrated coordination between different and connected brain regions. There is\nactivity in regions carrying out spatial analyses, motor behavior, goal directed assessments, and object\nrecognition, and much of this activity is fed forward to the frontal areas for storage in working memory as\nwell as judgment and evaluation. A healthy adult brain is a heavily connected brain. Promiscuity results\nfrom a network of interconnected brain regions.\n\nEven resting brains show signs of promiscuity. When you lie down in bed and close your eyes,\nbut before you drift off to sleep, your brain — assuming you are an adult and healthy — shows activity in\na family of inter-connected brain regions called the default network. This is your brain at rest, but it is\nanything but at rest. Some of the most active areas involve those that are engaged when we evaluate\nsocial relationships, consider what others believe and desire, who they are, and how we might interact in\nthe future. This same default network looks very different in children, as well as in the elderly: it is much\nless connected. Growing up is connecting up. Growing old is disconnecting. We gain promiscuous\nthinking as we mature and lose it as we age.\n\nIf connection is key, then disorders of the mind or physical insult should result in predictable loss\nof promiscuity.

As such, we believe the private\nsector (Zain KSA, Mobily and STC) will be key contributors to the financing of the\nexpansion plan.\n\n..intensifying the case for creation of a Saudi tower company\n\nThe Saudi telecom service providers have invested heavily in rolling out high speed\nwireless networks and, in the case of Mobily and STC, FTTH networks (not to mention\nlicense costs). This has seen the balance sheets of both Mobily and Zain KSA reaching\nrelatively high gearing levels; thereby limiting their ability to step up capital expenditure\nfor a sustained period. Consequently, we believe the focus on raising capital (to fund the\nexpansion programmes) from the spin out of their Tower portfolios will only increase.\nWe see Zain KSA as the key beneficiary of this given they have the most highly geared\nbalance sheet amongst Saudi Telco peers.\n\nMobile market share gains for Zain KSA and Mobily increasingly important\n\nWhilst the Saudi government has taken steps to introduce competition in the\ntelecommunications industry, its moves to open the market have thus fallen short of\nthis objective. Specifically, government-owned STC retains more than 60% revenue\nmarket share in Saudi Arabia, giving it a dominant position in the market, whilst Mobily\nand Zain KSA have only managed to achieve c25% and 15% revenue market share\nrespectively.\n\nThis, in our view, has likely been driven by a number of factors including: (1) the\nrelatively high cost of market entry (ie licenses) for both Mobily and Zain KSA, which has\nlumbered both with high operating costs; (2) high royalty costs, which amount to c16%\nof revenues generated in Saudi Arabia (with some exceptions, including data), arguably\ninhibiting requisite marketing and infrastructure spend. We note both Mobily and Zain\nKSA remain loss making; and, (3) the relatively high mobile termination rates, which\narguably afford an advantage to STC and prevent Zain or Mobily from competing more\naggressively on price.\n\nFor the realisation of the NTP, we believe it is important that all private sector players\nare realising sufficient rates of return and FCF generation to be able to finance the\n\nrequisite growth in infrastructure. We note both Mobily and Zain KSA were loss making\nin 2015 and are expected to return sub 5% ROE’s in both 2016 and 2017 (according to\n\nOS merrill Lynch GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 49\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016159\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Flynn may have leaked information that shows Pence and the Trump transition team knew \nthat foreign governments were paying him. \nIf this information turns out to be true, it would be a devastating blow to the Vice President's reputation. So far, Pence is \nuntouched by the Russia scandal. \nThe prevailing opinion is that Pence didn't know anything about Flynn's calls to the Russian ambassador to the U.S. And \nthe administration's story is that Flynn lied about his Russian contacts to Pence. \nRelated \nWATCH: In a Shocking Turn of Events, Flynn Moves To Take Down Pence. \nALERT: House Democrats Made The PERFECT Trap For Pence, and He Fell Right Into It. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031740 \nIT'S HAPPENING: Trump Insider TURNS On Trump, Asks For Plea Deal to Expose Trump. \nBut these new leaks fly in the face of all this. They suggest that Pence knew about all of Flynn's dealingswith foreign \ngovernments and chose to ignore them. \nAdditionally, Pence was the head of the Trump transition team and was supposed to vet all of Trump's appointees. So he \nshould have known about Flynn's work with Turkey and Russia. \nSo either Pence is incompetent, or he's an outright liar. Neither is a good quality for a Vice President. \nWashington Post reporter Karen Tumulty also stated that Pence was in the Oval Office right before President Trump asked \nComey to drop the Flynn investigation. So Pence may also have been involved in Trump's efforts to obstruct the \ninvestigation into Flynn and the Russia scandal. \nFlynn may not have finished with Pence, either. Bloomberg Politics editor John Heilemann showed how Flynn can keep the \npressure on Pence. \nHeilemann said, \"Either he [Pence] knew and is lying or he did not know and was wildly incompetent. Either way, not a \ngreat story for him.\" \n\"By the way, it seems to me the import of this story is that Michael Flynn's lawyer came out a couple of months ago and \nsaid that Mike Flynn had a story to tell,\" continued Heilemann. \"He's now starting to tell that story.\" \nPOLL: Is the whole Trump administration going down? \nThe Trump administration claims that Vice President Mike Pence didn't know anything about Michael Flynn's work with \nthe Russian or Turkish governments. \nBut Flynn has allegedly released information contradicting these claims. \nIs Flynn trying to take down the whole Trump administration? Share your opinion in the poll below. \nHeilemann suggested that Flynn might be leaking these stories in \norder to get immunity. Flynn's hoping that he can prove his story is \nworth enough to gain immunity from prosecution. \n\"If this is the thing that he's leaking, and there are other things that he's still holding to offer in exchange for immunity, that \nmeans this isn't even the worst of it___that means he's got more things to say,\" said Heilemann. \nIf that's true, that means there's more bad news coming for Pence and Trump. Flynn could help take down both men. \nIt looking more and more like Pence is also guilty of treason. So Congress should impeach Pence as well as Trump. \nUnfortunately, that would put House Speaker Paul Ryan in charge. But at least he's not in the Russian President's pocket. \nFlynn's trying to get his revenge and take down the Vice President.

This is a good thing\nas it motivates us to take care of our self-interests and strive for bigger and better. But a desire system\nthat never sleeps is a system that 1s motivated to accrue ever larger coffers or power. To satisfy this\ninflationary need is often not possible without harming others, either directly or indirectly. To offset the\ncosts of harming another, desire recruits denial. This is a recipe for evil and the creation of excessive\nharms. It is a recipe that takes two, often benign and highly adaptive ingredients that are essential for\nmotivating action and promoting survival, and combines them into an explosive outcome. Seen in this\nway, our capacity for evil is as great as our capacity for love and compassion. Evil is part of human\nnature, a capacity that can’t be denied. What I will show is both how this capacity works, and how some\nof us, due to biological inheritance and environmental influence, are more likely to end up as evildoers.\n\nHistorical material on the lives of Franz Stangl and Adolf Eichmann, leaders in the Nazi\nannihilation of Jews, illustrates how desire and denial combine within individual minds to create\nexcessive harms. Although this is a historical example, focused on the lives of only two men, stories like\ntheirs have been recounted hundreds of times, all over the globe and across time. This pattern points to\ncommon mechanisms, identified in detail by the sciences of human nature.\n\nStangl was a politically motivated man with a burning desire to climb to the top of the Nazi\nhierarchy. A clear path opened when he was appointed commander of the Polish prison Treblinka.\nUnbeknownst to Stangl, Treblinka was one of the Nazi’s concentration death camps. To fulfill his desire\nfor power therefore required harming thousands of others, or more accurately, commanding Nazi soldiers\nto harm others on his behalf. But since Stangl had no burning desire to harm the Jews, he dehumanized\nthem, transforming living, breathing, feeling, and thinking people into lifeless “cargo” — his own\nexpression. Stang] was dry-eyed as officers under his command killed close to one million Jews, one\nthird of them children. The reward? Power and status within the Nazi hierarchy. The death of innocent\nJews was a foreseen consequence of Stangl’s desire for power, not his direct goal.\n\nEichmann, Lieutenant Colonel in the Nazi regime, was considered one of the central architects of\nthe Final Solution, the master plan for the extermination of Jews. Eichmann denied Jews their humanity\nby championing the pamphlets and posters that portrayed them as vermin and parasites. This\ndehumanizing transformation empowered Eichmann’s belief that cleansing was the only solution to\nGerman integrity and power. Eichmann’s reward? Elimination of the Jews. Unlike Stangl, killing Jews\nwas rewarding. As the historian Yaacov Lozowick stated “Eichmann and his ilk did not come to murder\nJews by accident or in a fit of absent-mindedness, nor by blindly obeying orders or by being small cogs in\na big machine. They worked hard, thought hard, took the lead over many years. They were the alpinists of\n\nevil.”\n\nHauser Prologue.

Only 34 percent of the\nhighest-achieving high-school seniors whose families fell in the bottom quarter of income distribution — versus 78 percent\nin the top quarter — attended one of the country’s most selective colleges, based ona list of nearly 250 schools compiled by\nBarron’s.\n\nIn New York City, where a neighborhood like Bushwick, in Brooklyn, can seem like a satellite campus of Wesleyan and a\nprewar apartment building on the Upper East Side can feel like an lvy League dormitory for 46-year-olds, there has been\nconsiderable philanthropic attention, of the kind other cities ought to envy, paid to finding the most gifted low-income\nstudents and putting them ona similar path.\n\nIn 1978, Gary Simons, a Bronx teacher, founded Prep for Prep with the goal of identifying talented students of color in the\ncity and readying them for attendance at private schools like Dalton and Groton and so on. Hundreds of the program’s\nalumni have gone on to law, medical and business schools, and employment at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and\nTime Warner.\n\nAdecade ago, hoping also to advance the best students attending public high schools, Mr. Simons and others founded\nanother organization, Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America, or LEDA, which draws exceptional children from around\nthe country, regardless of race, almost entirely from families who make less than $55,000 a year. Applicants are required to\nbe in the top 10 percent of their class, having taken the most difficult courses their schools offer. The 60 who gain entry to the\nprogram each year spend the summer before 12th grade at Princeton, studying ethics, political theory and public policy, and\npreparing for standardized college entrance exams.\n\nIn awondrous righting of the current disequilibrium, however small its scale, they are tutored for those tests by the same\ninstructors who work with some of Manhattan’s wealthiest teenagers: the staff of Advantage Testing, whose services cost\nparents up to $795 an hour.

They’ve run up a lot this week but we’re getting\nendless calls from generalists asking which banks to buy — there is still more upside to the sector. Banks also\nprovide some offset to your bonds if interest rates continue to move. Our financials sector specialist thinks XLF\ncould have another 20-25% upside given its many levers to the Trump trade: less regulation, higher interest\nrates/steeper yield curve, higher vol, economic growth, etc. The regional banks are asset sensitive and more of a\npure play on a rates move but we view the larger cap banks as having even more upside to the Trump Trade\ngiven the above points.\n\nBuy an XLF 17March2017 call spread:\n° Buy the 105% call / sell a 110% call with a 115% at-expiry knock-in\n° Total premium: 1.75%\n\nAll eyes are on Sunday’s 60 Minutes interview with Trump. Market is pricing that all regulations will be rolled\nback (very optimistic). Any hint that this is not true could lead to pullback on Monday.\n\nNote on tech: we’re seeing FANG used as a source of funds with the rotation from growth into value. There’s\nalso the tax read-through: tech is already relatively tax advantaged @ 22%; Industrials are at 30%, Financials at\n29%. Next year, tech could benefit from a repatriation tax holiday but that is viewed as more of a Q1/Q? trade.\n\nMore thoughts on financials:\n\nWith respect to the economy, the market is certainly indicating that there will be a large fiscal stimulus which\nmay send US growth higher and that’s a good thing for financials for a wide variety of reasons, from\nemployment to wages to loan growth and credit quality (even if somewhat offset by higher rates). It does\nremain to be seen exactly how much of this expected policy actually gets done, but at the moment, investors are\nwilling to take a certain amount of growth on faith.\n\nSo those are positives for financials before we even discuss regulation. The move in the financials since the\nelection would seem to indicate that investors have concluded that nearly every piece of financial regulation\nwill get put into a shredder on day one of the new administration. The incoming administration has fueled that\nwith comments about rolling back pieces (or more) of Dodd-Frank in particular. I can see making the case for\nthat to the American public by saying that banks need less regulation in order to get more capital flowing into\nthe economy to drive growth. Not only does that mean that the E is likely too low (meaning that the P/E is not\nas high as it seems) but it could help improve ROE’s as well which could increase the multiple of that higher E\ninvestors are willing to pay. Note that while ROEs could go higher, it’s unlikely that they can get back to the\npeaks...\n\nRegards,\nAmanda\n\nAmanda Ens\n\nDirector\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated\nOne Bryant Park, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10036\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014313\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Another way to say this\nis that there is a resonant response in an\nobserver’s motor system to observing a\nbehavior and this may potentiate a\ndegree of social coordination and\nconnection, as discussed in Semin’s\nchapter. This kind of neural resonance\nhas been shown to play a role in\nunderstanding speech when seeing a\ntalker’s mouth move, even if the listener\ndoes not actually make any mouth\nmovements.\n\nMirror neurons demonstrate that\nobserved action can produce a resonant\nresponse in an observer’s brain. Seeing\na talker’s mouth move creates a motor-\nresonant response that aids in\nunderstanding speech sounds. However,\nthese two observations are very different\nfrom the idea that the meaning of\nsentences can create a resonant response\nin the listener’s brain. In the case of\nspeech, mouth movements are the\nactions that create speech. This might\nseem like a very special case. The\ntraditional linguistic view of language is\nthat words and sentences are symbolic:\nLanguage describing action is not action\nitself. Language describing emotion is\nnot the emotion itself. The entire\nconcept of a symbol is that a symbol\ndenotes something, stands for\nsomething, but the symbol is not the\nthing itself. But it now appears that this\nlong-held notion may be wrong.\n\nThe idea that seeing an object or\nevent gives rise to brain states that\nresonate with previous experiences of\nthat thing suggests a mechanism for\nlanguage understanding to go beyond\nsymbolic interpretation. Given that there\nis a brain mechanism for re-experiencing\nactions or sensations, this same\nmechanism may operate even when\nthere is just a symbolic linguistic\n\nPage |70\n\ndescription. Understanding language\nmay take place by invoking such\nresonant past experiences in the brain.\n\nFor example, when listening to\nsentences about hockey action, hockey\nplayers show neural activity in their\nmotor system which is not seen for\npeople who are naive to hockey.’\nExperience playing hockey recruits the\nmotor system in service of\nunderstanding hockey sentences as if\none were watching or playing hockey\nwhen only listening to speech. This\nsuggests one way in which language can\nhave a direct impact on a listener.\nRather than making inferences about\nactions based on the meanings of\nsentences, understanding a sentence may\nbe a resonant motor system response in\nthe listener to a description of an action.\nIf this idea is extended more broadly,\nlanguage impact may come from such\nresonant responses. Language\nunderstanding and the impact of\nlanguage may result from processes\nmore similar to the effects of hearing\nlaughter. Hearing a sentence may create\nin a listener a set of resonant responses\nvery similar to the patterns that\ncorrespond to the actual situations being\ndescribed.\n\nSuch resonant responses need not\nbe confined to the motor system and\nactions. Emotions such as fear or joy\nmay be empathically evoked in listeners\nby speech just as a scream or laughter\nmight. Verbal expression of attitudes\nmay produce similar attitudinal\nresponses in listeners. Moreover, if a\nlistener’s resonant response is strong,\nthere may be increased empathic overlap\nwith the speaker, which may serve to\nincrease social connection. To the\nextent that people speak together and\nshare feelings, social connection may\nincrease as well.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021316\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

'°4 After hearing from the victim about the plea, the court can determine what weight to give to the victim's views.\nTo mplement the victim's right to be heard regarding a plea, the proposed rule change requires the court to directly address any\nvictim present in court. This is consistent with the CVRA's legislative history that explains that \"this provision is intended to\nallow crime victims to directly address the court in person.\" !°° The language of the proposed rule is lifted from an earlier\nparagraph in Rule 11, which requires the court to \"address the defendant personally in open court\" “before accepting a plea of\nguilty.\" '°7 Victims should be treated even-handedly. It may be important for the judge to address victims directly because\nmany victims will lack the assistance of counsel.

This requirement is taken essentially verbatim from the Attorney General\nGuidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance, which direct prosecutors to \"make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims\n\n153 See, e.g., Conn.

Terrible, nation-demolishing wars\nwould not soon victimize China, Deng thought. Nation building was the nature of the\nage. Its tools would be science, finance, and trade. If the Chinese people worked\nhard, he promised his incredulous listeners, they might by the year 2000 grow their\nthin $250 per capita income to the nearly unimaginable target of $1000. “I don’t\ncare if the cat is white or black,” he famously observed, “as long as it catches mice.”\nSocialism?

That they will\nbe built atop the sharp-edged shards of a collapsing older system heightens the\nurgency at which they must emerge.

We have examined the dynamics of the global market and\nthe various components of the gas value chain, and identified the areas\nwe see as the most significant beneficiaries currently.

Additionally,\nthe parent's legal department approved the retention of the\nthird-party agent through whom the bribes were arranged\ndespite a lack of documented due diligence and an agency\nagreement that violated corporate policy; also, an official of\nthe parent approved one of the payments to the third-party\nagent.'*! Under these circumstances, the parent company\nhad sufficient knowledge and control of its subsidiary’s\nactions to be liable under the FCPA.\n\nSuccessor Liability\n\nCompanies acquire a host of liabilities when they\nmerge with or acquire another company, including those aris-\ning out of contracts, torts, regulations, and statutes. As a gen-\neral legal matter, when a company merges with or acquires\nanother company, the successor company assumes the prede-\ncessor company’s liabilities.’* Successor liability is an integral\ncomponent of corporate law and, among other things, pre-\nvents companies from avoiding liability by reorganizing.'”\nSuccessor liability applies to all kinds of civil and criminal\nliabilities,!** and FCPA violations are no exception. Whether\nsuccessor liability applies to a particular corporate transac-\ntion depends on the facts and the applicable state, federal,\nand foreign law. Successor liability does not, however, create\nliability where none existed before. For example, if an issuer\nwere to acquire a foreign company that was not previously\nsubject to the FCPA’s jurisdiction, the mere acquisition of\nthat foreign company would not retroactively create FCPA\nliability for the acquiring issuer.\n\nDOJ and SEC encourage companies to conduct pre-\nacquisition due diligence and improve compliance pro-\ngrams and internal controls after acquisition for a variety\nof reasons. First, due diligence helps an acquiring company\nto accurately value the target company. Contracts obtained\nthrough bribes may be legally unenforceable, business\nobtained illegally may be lost when bribe payments are\nstopped, there may be liability for prior illegal conduct, and\nthe prior corrupt acts may harm the acquiring company’s\nreputation and future business prospects. Identifying these\n\nissues before an acquisition allows companies to better\n\nThe FCPA:\n\nAnti-Bribery Provisions\n\nevaluate any potential post-acquisition liability and thus\nproperly assess the target's value.'® Second, due diligence\nreduces the risk that the acquired company will continue to\npay bribes. Proper pre-acquisition due diligence can iden-\ntify business and regional risks and can also lay the founda-\ntion for a swift and successful post-acquisition integration\ninto the acquiring company’s corporate control and com-\npliance environment. Third, the consequences of potential\nviolations uncovered through due diligence can be handled\nby the parties in an orderly and efficient manner through\nnegotiation of the costs and responsibilities for the inves-\ntigation and remediation. Finally, comprehensive due dili-\ngence demonstrates a genuine commitment to uncovering\nand preventing FCPA violations.\n\nIn a significant number of instances, DOJ and\nSEC have declined to take action against companies\nthat voluntarily disclosed and remediated conduct\nand cooperated with DOJ and SEC in the merger and\nacquisition context.\" And DOJ and SEC have only\ntaken action against successor companies in limited cir-\ncumstances, generally in cases involving egregious and\nsustained violations or where the successor company\ndirectly participated in the violations or failed to stop the\nmisconduct from continuing after the acquisition. In one\ncase, a U.S.-based issuer was charged with books and records\nand internal controls violations for continuing a kickback\nscheme originated by its predecessor.’ Another recent case\ninvolved a merger between two tobacco leaf merchants,\nwhere prior to the merger each company committed\nFCPA violations through its foreign subsidiaries, involving\nmultiple countries over the course of many years. At each\ncompany, the bribes were directed by the parent company’s\nsenior management. The two issuers then merged to form\na new public company.

As Michael\nHartnett argues, the rise of populism can be linked to what he refers to as Peak\nInequality and Peak Globalisation. Trump and the Brexit campaign tapped into deep\napathy with the socio-economic order that for them remains unreformed post-GFC.\nThat’s why the poster boy for this dislocation is often the blue collar voter whose\nstandards of living have not been rising in the increasingly globalised world. The crucial\nquestion for investors as we enter a busy year for European politics (see table opposite}\nis whether the populism train will gather pace or terminate at the Eurozone.\n\nItaly risks elevated, but risks two way and banks the bigger issue\n\nAlthough Italy goes to the polls this year, it is worthwhile starting with this Sunday’s\nvote. In Strategy Insights: Italy risks elevated we argue that our base case is a narrow\nrejection of the proposed constitutional reform, which is another vote against governing\nparty on Dec 4. But unlike UK/ US, this would be expected and Renzi is likely to stay on\nso the outcome should not carry the same surprise or uncertainty factor for markets.\nThe tail risk are also two way. A large “No” vote could perceived as supportive of the 5\nstar movement but a “Yes” vote would be bullish Italy and risk assets more generally.\nThe bigger issue is likely recapitalisation of the Italian banks. This remains a significant\ntail risk for banks and was part of why we downgraded the sector.\n\nA Le Pen victory could prove the biggest risk to European markets in 2017\nProbably the most natural fit for the populism theme in 2017 is the French presidential\nelection. Although polls have been somewhat discredited by events this year they\nremain useful as an indication of where the public mood lies. With that caveat in mind,\ncurrent voting intentions suggests Front National leader Marine Le Pen will receive\nenough votes to progress to the second round and is likely to be joined by Republican\ncandidate Francois Fillon. Although when Fillon and Le Pen are polled together in a\nsecond round runoff Fillon is ahead by ~65%-35%, Le Pen is seen as capable of\nappealing to the same anti-establishment / blue collar voters as Trump/ Brexit.\n\nChart 37: Vol already picking up around the French primaries next year Chart 38: Yet Fillon still well ahead of Le Pen in polls of a potential run-\n6 off\n25.5 100\n25 90\n80\n24.5 70\n24 60\n23.5 50\n23 40\n30\n22.5 70\n22 10\n015 m—— VSTOXX 11/29/2016 ———VSTOXX -1m a\nv4 12-14 15-17 13-16 10-12 14-17 9-11 25-Nov 27-Nov\nKS) A A A A A A April April May June June Sept\no o o ° io Re NY\nfF SF SF KM KF KK KY\n\nm Francois Fillon (%) ™ Marine Le Pen (%)\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nSource: Ifop (12-14 Apr, 14-17 Jun), BVA (15-17 Apr, 13-16 Mar, 10-12 Jun, 9-11 Sept), Odoxa (25\nNov), Harris Interactive (27 Nov).

The leap from deciding liver allocations to shutting down liquor\nplants might seem pretty short to a rationalizing machine. And if such a machine\ncould really “think”, Vinge bet it would pretty quickly conclude that the restraints of\nits creators were limiting what it had been asked to do. At which point the AI would\nturn to thinking about how to escape those bounds. It would be like Deep Blue\nprogrammed to plan its own prison break. And as much as humans might try to\nstifle a smart machine, we’d be fighting to contain something more powerful than\nwe'd ever encountered.\n\nThis challenge, which sounds like something out of science fiction, is known by\ntechnologists by a name that does sound like a short story by Isaac Asimov: “The\nConfinement Problem”. The computer scientist Butler Lampson named this in 1973\nas a sort of task for computer security experts - possibly their last. The assignment:\nNot simply to keep malware out of a system, but to keep the mind of a malicious\nmachine inside. To gate it. Today computer science labs are filled with nervous,\napocalyptic research imagining the impossible troubles of confinement. The debate\ndivides those who think smart technology can be contained - “Boxers,” they are\ncalled - and those like Vinge who think the AI will always, eventually escape.\n“Imagine yourself confined to your house with only limited data access to the\noutside, to your master.” he wrote, putting the reader in the place of an AI machine.\n“If those masters thought ata rate -- say - one million times slower than you, there\nis little doubt that over a period of years (your time) you could come up with\n‘helpful advice’ that would incidentally set you free.”\n\nImagine you are in charge of containing that health-optimizing AI. What if it told you\nit had the power to cure all illness and hunger, to ameliorate the misery of the world,\nif only it could be permitted to really control access to all the world’s trading and\ntransport market? Let me out! Would you refuse?2°8 Would that be ethical?\nEventually, perhaps, the Al would study the physics of its own electrics, discover\nlaws no human knows, and then slip free from its box on a trail of bits we’d never\nimagined, using physical laws we'll never discover. Impossible? “It seems to me that\nhistorically ‘impossible’ has essentially always meant ‘I can’t figure out how to do it\nright now,” the computer scientist Michael Vassar has written about such a situation.\n“People proposing AI boxes are a bit like literature majors proposing to\n\nlock McGuyver in a ‘room full of discarded electronics components.’”26? The\ncomputers, built to solve problems, will do exactly that. This is perhaps why some of\nthe bleakest warnings about AI come from the very New Caste figures now\naccelerating their adoption.

The sideways move was visible across all commodity sectors, with gold (precious metals)\ndelivering a temporary price uptick after the May US nonfarm payroll release.\n\nDespite signs of price stabilization, diversified commodity indices are likely to decline in the\ncoming weeks. Sluggish economic activity should put upward pressure on most commodity\ninventories. To mitigate inventory buildups, lower prices are required, in our view. Production cuts for\ncyclical commodities need to be incentivized, while demand needs a push.\n\nThe starting point for gold (precious metals) remains challenging, with supply likely to outpace\ndemand this year. However, the chance of further monetary easing (QE3) by the Fed - which is not our\nbase case - is an upside risk to the gold price. Given the weak fundamental situation combined with\nthe substantial QE3 risk we maintain our neutral position.\n\nEasing geopolitical tensions related to Iran and further inventory builds in crude oil shifted the\nmarket's attention to sluggish demand growth. With muted incremental crude oil consumption, crude\noil prices are likely to remain under pressure. But as production cuts are likely to kick in, downward\nprice momentum should slow meaningfully. OPEC production cuts of up to 0.5 mbpd are needed in\nthe coming months, and should allow the Brent price to stabilize in the USD 80.5 - 90/bbl range (WTI\nwith a USD 12/bbl discount). But a sideways move in crude oil is not good enough to be long the\ncommodity. The Brent forward curve has joined WTI and moved into contango as well. Hence, we\nkeep our underweight position.\n\nWith regards to base metals, prices have room to soften in the very short run (4-6 weeks). Copper\nprices are likely to decline to USD 6,600/mt in order to weigh on scrap supply and compensate for\ndeteriorating Chinese import volumes. But the price decline in copper and other base metals should be\nshort lived. Fiscal and monetary easing in China provide the basis for an acceleration in base metal\ndemand and should keep prices largely flat on a 6-month horizon. Moreover, metals like aluminum\nand nickel are already trading deeply into the production cost curve, which we regard as\nunsustainable over the long run. We keep a neutral position on base metals until we see further\nconfirmation of a pickup in Chinese economic activity.\n\nThe outlook for ample supply in agricultural commodities, especially for corn, should still weigh on\nthe grain complex towards the end of the year. Some short-term price support from dry US Midwest\nweather conditions in recent weeks is not altering our negative stance. Soft commodities are also\nbattling with higher inventories, which will not bode well for prices in 3Q 2012.\n\nFor further information please contact CIO's asset class specialists Dominic Schnider, dominic.schnider@ubs.com or Giovanni Staunovo, giovanni.staunovo@ubs.com\n\nPreferences (6 months)\n\nunderweight neutral overweight\n\nCommodities Tid\n\ntotal\n\nPrecious\n\nMetals\n\nenergy |\n\nBase Metals\n\nAgricultural\n\nBnew old\n\nSource: UBS CIO, as of 22 June 2012\n\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\n34\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024169\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

CDPH also\ntechnically bans the sale of CBD oil outside of licensed cannabis retailers, though it isn’t\nalways enforced.\n\nSeparately, California Governor Jerry Brown signed a law in late September 2018\n(Assembly Bill 2914) that bans the addition of CBD or THC to any cocktail at a public\nestablishment.

The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I've just been. You will never \nthink the same way about anything again.\" \nSo spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up everywhere at the moment \nas the alleged \"procurer\" of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. \nEpstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of another \ninvestigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with allegations that he molested \nthem when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British newspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein's \nfriendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to publicly disassociate himself from his old pal. \nI wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called \"The Talented Mr. Epstein.\" It was largely a business piece that focused on his \nmysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les Wexner, the chairman of Limited \nBrands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail \nsentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of $450 million. \nThe piece alluded to Epstein's great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women with whom he had \nsexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the issue that remains a mystery—how \nJeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. \nThis is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on the intriguing \nfinancial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same ones, different ones. And their stories are bone-\nchilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one case, flown—to ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? \nAnd the British, especially, want to know: Who is she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, \nmy 2003 Vanity Fairstory that really brought him into the limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself. \nBizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept running into both of \nthem, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of young women with him who stand two \nfeet behind him, as if serving a monarch. \"Do they speak?\" I remember asking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He \nlaughed. \"Not like you, Vicky,\" was his riposte. \nI remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn't studied math \nsince I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at home via messenger. It was a \nbook: \"Math for idiots.\" \nSo he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. \n\"Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects,\" newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He was certainly \npreaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few moments in his company and \nyou know this to be true. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030462 \nWhen I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that \"Andy\"—as \nJeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange title is. Because if one \nthing's for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he's talking about far more than \"Andy\" does. \nWhich is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other financiers hang out with him. \nAnd Ghislaine? \nFull disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It's almost impossible not to. \nShe is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hours talking to her about \nthe third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious. She has spent weeks at the bottom \nof the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away \nalmost anyone else's I can think of—probably even Rupert Murdochs'. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for \nhours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is close friends. \nYet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-Platero, (known \nfondly to her close friends as \"the Tennis Goddess\") Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes down to things she \nreally cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability. \nAnd that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey. \n\"He saved her,\" I remember a close friend of mine telling me. \"When her father died, she was a wreck; inconsolable. And then \nJeffrey took her in. She's never forgotten that—and never will.\" \nIn many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect replacement for her \nfather, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine's \nfather was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving a massive \"black hole\" he'd fraudulently created. To \nGhislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that strange. \nIn fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful people in the end \neither have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and moved countries to avoid \npaying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don't tend to get to the top by being the world's most \nbalanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn't quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second \n\"wife\" for many years whose existence he has been open about. \nSo what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her loyalty to friends \nlike Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look at Waksal and Stewart. No one \nsees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for all sorts of blemishes. \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

In that case, a series of errors resulted in the loss of three transmission lines in Ohio over the course of about an\nhour. Once the third line went down, the outage cascaded towards the coast, cutting power to some 50 million people.\nHavlin says that this outage is an example of the inherent instability his study describes, but others question whether the\nteam’s conclusions can really be extrapolated to the real world.\n\n“| suppose | should be open-minded to new research, but I'm not convinced,” says Jeff Dagle, an electrical engineer at the\nPacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington, who served on the government task force that investigated\nthe 2003 outage. “The problem is that this doesn’t reflect the physics of how the power grid operates.”\n\nCritical order\n\nHavlin and his colleagues focused on idealized scenarios. They found that randomly structured networks — such as social\nnetworks — degrade slowly as nodes are removed, which in the real world might mean there is time to diagnose and\naddress a problem before a system collapses. By contrast, the connections of orderly lattice structures have more critical\nnodes, which increase the instability. The problem is that such orderly networks are always operating near an indefinable\nedge, Havlin says. To reduce that risk, he recommends adding a small number of longer transmission lines that provide\nshort cuts to different parts of the grid.\n\nBenjamin Carreras, a physicist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee who has conducted similar work2, says that\nnetwork theory can be useful for providing insight into electric grids but must be complemented with more complex models\nthat attempt to represent both the physical realities and the responsiveness of the modern electric grid. Although in some\ncases adding long lines can benefit the overall stability of an electric system, Carreras’ work suggests that in certain\ncircumstances such an approach allows problems to propagate even farther.\n\n“More connections may stabilize some processes, by, for instance, increasing the number of paths to generators, but also\nmay destabilize others,” Carreras says. “One cannot make generic statements on this topic.”\n\nAlthough local outages caused by falling trees knocking down distribution lines are common, large-scale failures within the\ncore ne transmission lines rarely occur ona modern electric grid. Before 2003, the last major blackout in the United States\nhad been on the west coast in 1996, and more recently an outage has struck in the San Diego area.\n\nDagle says that the 2003 blackout stemmed from a combination of bad vegetation management — the first three lines\ntripped after sagging into trees but were all within their load rating — and a series of monitoring and communications\nbreakdowns. Vegetation requirements have since been standardized, and a new generation of sensors is providing grid\noperators with more information about what is happening across the grid at any given moment.\n\n“Many more utilities have much more data,” Dagle says. “The next phase of our voyage is to make better use of that data.”\nBack to top\nTechnology — Full text articles\n\nBallmer Departure From Microsoft Was More Sudden Than Portrayed by the Company\nKara Swisher — All Things D\n\nAccording to sources close to the situation, the departure of CEO Steve Ballmer from Microsoft last week was more sudden\nthan was depicted by the company in its announcement that he would be retiring within the next year in a planned smooth\ntransition.\n\nIt was neither planned nor as smooth as portrayed.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019419\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

For more neutral\ncommodity exposure we like baskets of EUR, CAD, COP and CLP, AUD to fund RUB\nand PEN trades respectively.\n\nCarry is in the eye of the beholder\n\nTo focus on identifying best carry trades in the current environment of rising US\ninterest rates sounds counterintuitive at least. It is well know that carry trades perform\nnicely in risk-on periods as well as in a low volatility environment, which is the opposite\nof what we expect in the coming months. However, once proper factor exposure of\ncurrency returns is considered, smart carry reemerges as an interesting proposition. As\nwe have documented (Forecasting with Compass30), most of the variation in currency\nreturns can be explained by the first two principal components, which can be labeled as\ndollar and carry factor respectively, as they are highly correlated with USD and carry\nperformance.\n\nExpected returns of carry strategies are defined by interest rate differentials (ie, carry),\nassuming no change in spot exchange rates. Uncovered interest parity states that the\ncarry should be offset by a change in the spot of equal magnitude. However, empirical\nevidence (so called forward premium puzzle) clearly shows that carry trades are\nprofitable on average, which indicates the presence of currency risk premium. Since\nboth dollar and carry, are priced factors, any sensible carry strategy in an environment in\nwhich US rates are rising needs to hedge the USD exposure. This is just a necessary\nthough not a sufficient condition, since the carry factor is also correlated with global\nmeasures of risk. Interestingly, post-election currency losses is not as highly correlated\nwith carry, indicating that carry trades were not as a strong investment theme as it was\nthe case during the taper tantrum episode (Chart 62).\n\nChart 62: Carry didn’t drive currency reaction to US elections Chart 63: Asia and LatAm display the highest risk-adjusted carry\n\n25 m 1m carry (annualized) - 15 3\nCurrency depreciation since Nov8 (rhs)\n\nmw 1m carry (annualized) / 1m implied ATM vol\n\n@1m carry (annualized) / max 1m DD (5y, rhs)\n\nor\nB\n\noa\n=\no\n&\n5\na\n=\nca)\nPel\n\nobal Research, Bloomberg\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n\nBankofAmerica <2”\n\n36 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014766\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Mary thought it would be a good idea to share this with our clients given the events\nof the day.\n\n“Here is what I plan to say at our Aspen Insights conference tomorrow about today’s events. The last two weeks have\nbeen a severe setback for financial markets and the global recovery.\n\n[1] Today, Italian equity markets sold off sharply and were eventually shut down after the ECB (for now) rejected\nbeing the buyer of last resort for Italian government bonds, as the markets were hoping. The Bundesbank\napparently has objections to the idea. This is a problem: Italy has issued around as much public debt as Germany, but\nis a considerably smaller country with almost twice the debt load as a percentage of its GDP. Absent a decision by\nGermany to move to Federalism or a lot more debt monetization by the ECB, the European Monetary Union (as it is\ncurrently configured) could be facing its final stretch. Today’s reported move by Italian regulators to seize documents at\nMoody’s regarding declines in Italian bank stocks is an indication of the pressure the system is under, and the possible\nsearch for scapegoats. I don’t think you will find a firm that has written more often and more direly about the structural\ninconsistencies of the EMU than we have (I have a 2-year bibliography of what we said and when, if anyone wants\n\nit). The “Sick Men of Europe” paper from February 2010 and “Don Quixote Thanksgiving” from November 2010 go into\nthe greatest detail on why. Our concerns sky-rocketed upon Greece’s financial disclosures in November 2009, after\nwhich we took portfolio decisions to back that up, purging exposures to the GIPSI countries from our credit, government\nbond and equity portfolios. Since early 2010, our underweight positions in Europe represent the largest regional\nunderweights we have ever held.\n\n[2] Will there be another recession in the US? Our friend Marty Feldstein at Harvard puts the odds at 50-50. Sell\nside and buy side economists missed last month’s US economic rollover by a country mile, so I am not sure how much\nweight to put in their current forecasts. Most summarily dismissed our concerns that the recovery earlier this year had\nelements of a stimulus-driven mirage. Bridgewater Associates was the only firm we spoke to that consistently\nhighlighted the broader process of household deleveraging; and cautioned that when stimulus faded, so would the US\neconomy, given the weakness in household income. Their insights have been invaluable to us in terms of not stepping\ninto this and taking too much risk prematurely during the three market swoons this year. Our central scenario for the US\nin 2012 is not another recession, but low growth in the 2.0% range, which is enough of a problem given the low job\ncreation that entails. Note that the CBO assumes growth rates of 3.0% to 3.6% over the next few years in their analyses\nof future US federal debt levels.\n\n[3] Do not blame today’s events on the debt ceiling debate, US politicians or European regulators. If we get to the\npoint where economic and profit fundamentals in a given market or region are not sustainable on their own, then\nwe should be underweight that region (as in Europe). Owning an asset class under the assumption that there will\nalways be a “Lord of the Flies” type rescue from Central Banks and Treasuries is very risky, and historically, fraught with\nfailure. I remember similar logic in the summer of 1998, when the accepted mantra was that the US would bail out\nRussia and Boris Yeltsin, since President Clinton would not want to see a nuclear power like Russia slide back into Soviet\nrule, or anarchy (that view turned out to be wrong). Anyone market-weight European risk out of the expectation that\n“Trichet and Merkel will fix surely it” is taking a binary risk that impossible to handicap. Similarly, we should not start\nbuying anything just because we think Qe3 is coming in the US (in the form of securities purchases, a permanently\ncontrolled long bond, etc).\n\n[4] When we began this year, I made the following decision: we would risk underperforming if there was a strong\nequity rally, out of concerns about the macroeconomic landscape (weakness in the West, inflation in the East). As\na result, we have held less equity exposure than usual for a period of high margins, low P/E multiples and strong\nearnings. Instead, we’ve held larger exposures to investment grade and high yield credit, and hedge funds. Over the last\ncouple of years, our hedge funds (long-short funds with low net positions, macro hedge funds, distressed credit) have\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025226\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The regulations, which were first discussed\nlast year, allow foreign investors to own 100% of retail and wholesale businesses in\nthe country. Earlier, the ownership ceiling for foreigners was set at 75%. This\ninitiative is aimed at attracting more regional and international brands to Saudi\nArabia, creating more jobs, and boosting non-oil revenue. This has raised concerns\nregarding the sustainability of the business model of Saudi retailers.\n\ne Real estate is key to entering a market: unlike its peers, Al Hokair enjoys favourable\naccess to prime locations in well-located shopping malls owned by its parent\nshareholder, Al Hokair Group. Fashion retailers such as Inditex continue to compete\nfor good-quality real estate in shopping centres and on high streets.\n\ne — Jarir and Extra are more vulnerable to the entry of international retailers such as\nApple as barriers of entry are very low for consumer electronics and appliances.\nFurthermore, the government emphasis on developing tourism and family\nentertainments (Six Flags, Sea World) represents a potential threat to Jarir and\nExtra’s business models which still play an ‘entertaining’ role in Saudi Arabia.\n\ne — Such initiatives would result in (1) reducing the number of stores; (2) a rapid\nmodernization of the sector; and, (3) a significant increase in labor productivity by\nadopting merchandising best practices.\n\nRationale for liberalization\n\nThe rationale for permitting FDI in retail trading is (1) attracting investments in\nproduction and marketing; (2) improving the availability of such goods for the consumer;\n(3) encouraging increased sourcing of goods from Saudi Arabia; and, (4) enhancing\ncompetitiveness of Saudi enterprises through access to global designs, technologies and\nmanagement practices.\n\nTypically, global retailers follow a 100%-ownership business model, which explains their\nreluctance to establish their presence in Saudi Arabia because of the restrictive policy\nenvironment. This has been reflected in the little amount of FDI received in the Saudi\nretail sector.\n\nHowever, we do not believe that such decision will provide foreign investors more ability\nto have control of a company as the current ownership ceiling of 75% already allows\nthem to pass both ordinary and special resolutions.\n\nKey opportunities of 100% foreign ownership initiative:\nWe perceive several opportunities emerging from such an initiative:\n\n1) Capital infusion: FDI is one of the major sources of investments for a\ndeveloping country like Saudi Arabia wherein it expects investments from\nmultinational companies to improve economic activity, create jobs, share their\nexpertise, back-end infrastructure and research and development in the host\ncountry.\n\n2) Boost competition and dampen inflation: the entry of the many multinational\ncorporations will promise intense competition between the different\ncompanies offering their brands in a particular product market. This will result\nin availability of many varieties, reduced prices, and convenient distribution of\nthe marketing offers.\n\n3) Improvement of supply chain: Improvement of supply chain/distribution\nefficiencies, coupled with capacity building and introduction of modern\ntechnology will help arrest wastages, particularly in the food supply chain.\n\nOS Merrill Lynch GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 61\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016171\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Epstein alleged Edwards abused the court system by threatening to\ndepose Epstein’s powerful friends, which included Donald Trump and President Bill Clinton.\n\nOther claims included that Edwards tried to obtain records from an alleged sex therapist who had never treated Epstein\nand that Edwards used investigative tools that included trespassing on Epstein’s property.\n\nCrow gave Epstein’s attorneys 30 days to refile the lawsuit, which will be the second amended complaint and third\nevolution of the lawsuit.\n\nEpstein also named Edwards’ former boss, convicted Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein, in the lawsuit, alleging Rothstein\nmade “various representations to potential investors regarding the Epstein actions.”\n\nIn dismissing the lawsuit, Crow said he found “serious problems’ with the complaint. Crow called the lawsuit “vague.\n“You have to know, at this point in time, what he did or didn’t do that was an abuse of process,” Crow said.\n\nEpstein, 58, has confidentially settled more than two dozen lawsuits with young women who allege they were sexually\nabused by him when they were minors.\n\nEdwards filed a counterclaim, alleging Epstein filed the lawsuit to get Edwards to back down from representing the\nvictims.\n\n“Mr. Epstein had to pay more to settle these cases than he would have if Mr. Edwards wasn’t out there putting all this\npressure on him,” said attorney Jack Scarola, who represents Edwards. “That’s Mr. Edwards’ job ... to put as much\nlegitimate pressure on the defendant as he possibly could and he obviously did an extremely effective job.”\n\nEpstein pleaded guilty to two felony charges: soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor for prostitution. He served 13\nmonths in the county jail and has to register as a lifelong sex offender.\n\nRepresenting Epstein, attorney Joseph Ackerman argued unsuccessfully for a gag order. Ackerman said Scarola has\nrepeatedly made statements to several news organizations about the case.\n\n“Mr. Scarola has constantly referred to Mr. Epstein as a pedophile and there’s been no proof of that anywhere,”\nAckerman said. “Muzzling lawyers who may wish to make public statements has been long recognized as within the\ncourt’s inherent power ... We don’t believe it’s appropriate to wage a media campaign and taint the jury pool.”\nScarola said it would be unconstitutional to impose a gag order.\n\n“There is a complete and total absence of proof that we have engaged in any conduct whatsoever that could be\nprohibited,” Scarola said.\n\nScarola said he and Edwards have been asked to appear on national television as well as received interview requests\nfrom the foreign press. Scarola said he has been selective in his interviews.\n\nThere has been a frenzy in the British press ever since Virginia Roberts, an Epstein victim, spoke to the Sunday Daily\n\nMail earlier this year about being introduced to Prince Andrew and spending time with him at Epstein’s behest. Roberts\nalleged she served as a Sex slave to Epstein when she was a minor.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013440\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The belief state is a\nprobability mass function over the sequences of stimuli that the nodes learns to represent.\nConsequently, each node is allocated a predefined number of state variables each denoting a\ndynamic pattern, or sequence, that is autonomously learned.

Morgan View\nDo US elections change anything?\n� Asset allocation –– The equity market has priced out the Romney win scenario,\nbut from these levels, our economic and market outlook and risks are\nunchanged. These keep us medium-term overweight equities and credit, despite\nthe likely volatility as the fiscal cliff is negotiated. Within equities, we stay\nunderweight the US, and move most of the overweight into EM Asia. We have\nmoved some of our credit overweight from the US to Europe.\n� Economics –– The data flows continue to confirm that June/July was likely the\nbottom in global activity growth, and that we are gently lifting from those\nlevels, even as it will take well into next year before growth returns to trend.\n� Fixed Income –– Look for yields to head higher, but focus more risk on spread\ncompression trades.\n� Equities –– We focus our overweights on EM Asia, Cyclical stocks and US\nHome builders.\n� Credit –– We see the current dip as an opportunity to add risk.\n� Currencies –– Be long the dollar during the fiscal cliff negotiations.\n� Commodities –– A further set of better Chinese economic data keeps us long\nbase metals.\n� Equity markets are taking the Obama victory quite badly, with US stocks\ndown some 4% on Wednesday and Thursday. This has pushed up global bond\nmarkets, and credit spreads are wider, but commodities are largely ignoring this\nturmoil. We don’t think an Obama victory truly changes the economic outlook,\nor risks, but it does eliminate the Romney hope that appeared to have been in\nmarket pricing.\n� By definition, the Romney scenario is now priced out of the market. The US\nelections confirm the status quo in Washington, and to us, they do so also for\nthe broad economic and market outlook, from current levels. Hence, we do not\nsee much reason to change our investment allocations, and remain medium-term\noverweight both credit and equities against cash, government debt, and\ncommodities. We do so on the basis of value – still high risk premia – fading\nrisks on fiscal policy in the US into next year; an expected rebound in global\ngrowth; and super easy monetary policy, with more QE coming if growth were\nto disappoint.\n� In recent weeks, we have switched out of our long-standing US risk overweight,\ninto an underweight, on the argument that the US had the most committed\ncentral banker, its growth has been least disappointing, and its fiscal risks were\nfurther into the future. This relative risk has changed, with Chinese economic\ndata confirming that its economy is rebounding, while the ECB now creating a\nperiod a relative financial “peace”. The US, in contrast, is at the start of intense\nnegotiations on how to avoid a fiscal-cliff induced recession next year. Neither\nside of the aisle has an interest in being blamed for a recession. But markets will\nstill be buffeted by a steady news flow on wide gaps between each side’s\nposition.\nSee page 7 for analyst certification and important disclosures.\nGlobal Asset Allocation\nJan Loeys AC\n(1-212) 834-5874\njan.loeys@jpmorgan.com\nJPMorgan Chase Bank NA\nJohn Normand\n(44-20) 7134-1816\njohn.normand@jpmorgan.com\nJ.P.

Morgan View\n09 November 2012\n�\n�\nAs a result, we stay underweight US equities and have moved risk from our\nUS credit longs into Europe. Our initial US equity underweight was against\nEurope and EM Asia. Our recent downgrade of Q1 growth in the Euro area\nand better activity data in China made us move the lion’s share of the\noverweight versus the US into EM Asia (see Wednesday’s Global Market\nOutlook and Strategy).\nChinese activity data continue to surprise on the upside. October data for\nIP, retail sales and fixed investment each came above our expectations. This\ncreates upside risk, but no change yet, to our forecasts which already assume a\ngentle rise in quarterly growth rates from under 7% early this year to just\nabove 8% in Q1. Better data reduce the need for renewed fiscal and monetary\nstimulus. The 18th Party Congress started yesterday, will last a week, and will\nbe followed by the announcement of the next leadership. More important for\nthe economic outlook will be the Annual Central Economic Working\nConference that will be held in December. We expect it to support continued\nmoderate fiscal policy, a neutral monetary policy, and further economic\nrebalancing towards domestic consumption. It may also lower the 2013\ngrowth target to 7%. For more details, see Haibin Zhu in today’s GDW.\nFixed Income\n�\n�\n�\n�\nBonds rallied strongly, in the slipstream of the tumbling equity market.\nPresident Obama’s re-election perhaps also diminishes expectations of a\nchange in course at the Fed.\nThe ECB and the Bank of England stood pat at their policy meetings this\nweek, but the latter delivered a curveball today, announcing that its net\ncoupon income from QE would be transferred to the UK Treasury from next\nyear on. The near-term effect is a slight monetary easing, as the money will\nbe used to reduce the amount of gilts in issue, similar to QE itself.\nBeyond that, this is another small step towards perceptions that monetary\npolicy is no longer independent from fiscal policy, like the Bank of Japan’s\njoint statement with two government ministers last month. Nobody knows the\ntipping point at which these perceptions feed into much higher inflation\nexpectations, just that we’ll know it when we see it.\nCore euro bond yields are towards the low end of the range, and we expect\nthem to head higher. But we focus more risk on spread compression trades,\nvia overweights in Euro area peripherals, US MBS, and EM local bonds vs\nDM.\nEquities\n�\n�\n�\nEquity markets fell sharply post US elections, but we are not changing our\nstrategy.\nFrom a month ago, we avoided directional longs in our GMOS model equity\nportfolio due to elevated positions by spec investors (see Charts A10 and A12\nin today’s Flows & Liquidity). We preferred to focus instead on regional and\nsectoral trades. We stay with the same strategy focusing our\nrecommendations on EM Asia across regions, and Cyclical stocks and US\nHome builders across sectors.\nThe rebound in the October global manufacturing PMI is what keeps us long\nCyclical vs. Defensive equity sectors.

Morgan View\n09 November 2012\nnecessarily. Last summer, as equity markets rebounded in June and July,\nCyclical sectors actually underperformed. The thin grey line in the top chart\nshows that Cyclical sectors have recaptured only a quarter of the\nunderperformance seen between March and August and thus provide a better\nentry point. Position indicators suggest that investors are underweight\nCyclicals and overweight Defensives which is turn means that Defensive\nsectors are more vulnerable to position unwinding.\n�\nWe introduced an underweight in US equities in mid October to position for\nthe US fiscal cliff risk. Obama’s win makes it more likely that this risk will\nintensify into year-end. Across regions we favor EM Asia and Europe vs. the\nUS. While the US is facing fiscal cliff risks, Asian equities are benefiting\nfrom concrete signs that economic activity is rebounding in China. European\nequities are benefiting from greater improvement in financial conditions,\nalthough they are more vulnerable to noise around the Greek and Spanish\nissues.\nCredit\n�\n�\n�\nUS credit spreads edged wider in response to the fall in equity markets\nfollowing the US elections. US HG widened 7bp to 160bp, undoing around\nhalf of October’s peak-to-trough moves. Similar moves registered in other\nUSD credit markets. At 107bp, the CDX.IG is now back to early-August\nlevels, even as the CDS-Bond basis moved back into negative territory with\ncorporate bond spreads again moving above CDS.\nCredit spreads may be repricing the risk of a fiscal-cliff induced recession in\n2013. For context, we expect the eventual outcome of the negotiations to lead\nto about 2% of GDP in fiscal contraction, not enough to tip the economy back\ninto recession in itself, and considerably lower than the 4% drag under the full\nenactment of all revenue raising measures and spending cuts currently set to\nbecome law on Jan 1.\nFrom our point of view, the elections confirm the status quo both in\nWashington and in market conditions – i.e. we should expect more of the\nsame and it has been a great year for credit. Therefore, we see the current\ndip as an opportunity to add risk, and expect spreads to continue to tighten\ninto year end, albeit at a slower rate than in recent months. We stay down in\nquality and outline in GMOS this week some relative value arguments for\nEuro HY vs US HY. On that front, European credit shrugged off the election\noutcome, tightening marginally in the HG space and widening very slightly in\nthe HY space.\nForeign Exchange\n�\n�\nThe post-US election drama is unfolding as expected. Four more years with\nthe same cast is delivering a higher USD versus most currencies but JPY due\nto deleveraging ahead of the fiscal cliff, and lower USD/CNY forwards due to\navoidance of US-China trade conflict (see An FX guide to America’s toss-up\nelection, FX Markets Weekly, Nov 2). The only surprise has been that FX\nvolatility remains so subdued (VXY unchanged at 7.4%) in a week when the\ntrade-weighted dollar and equity volatility have rallied. Chalk it up to\npositioning, as most indicators suggest that institutions investors entered the\nUS polls with aggregate USD positions close to flat.\nNow, sausage-making season begins. US recession is guaranteed if the fiscal\ncliff is enacted on schedule, and neither Congress nor the President welcomes\nMore details in ...\nUS Credit Markets Outlook and Strategy, Eric Beinstein\net al.\nHigh Yield Credit Markets Weekly, Peter Acciavatti et al.\nEuropean Credit Outlook & Strategy, Steven Dulake et\nal.\nEmerging Markets Cross Product Strategy Weekly, Eric\nBeinstein et al.\n3\nJan Loeys\n(1-212) 834-5874\njan.loeys@jpmorgan.com\nGlobal Asset Allocation\nThe J.P. Morgan View\n09 November 2012\n�\n�\nthat outcome. But avoiding the worst case requires a short-term bargain plus a\nlong-term compromise on a scale not seen in Washington since the Clinton-\nCongressional budget showdown of 1995/96. As with sausage making, this\nprocess won’t be pleasant to watch. It would be easier to return in several\nweeks when the final product is ready, but for those who cannot avoid, ignore\nthe likely volatility, and add to defensive trades.\nWashington needs at least a month to broker deferral of a decent part of the\nfiscal cliff before it can assume the monumental task of comprehensive fiscal\nreform next year, and the currencies most vulnerable to an impasse are\nexpensive. If no grand bargain is reached before the end of the year, full\nimplementation of the cliff implies enough fiscal tightening to drive the dollar\nup 3%-5% versus commodity currencies, given typical patterns during global\ngrowth shocks. Even if these tax increases are reversed later in the year, the\nfirst response would be a higher USD versus all currencies but the yen, given\nhow long that investors are of cyclical currencies and how short they are the\nyen.\nStay short USD/JPY and buy USD vs high-beta (AUD, NZD, SEK and GBP)\nin cash and options for a move of a few percent in coming weeks. In options,\nsell a 1-mo NZD/USD call (0.8250 strike, 0.83 RKI), buy a bearish 2-mo\nAUD/USD seagull (buy 1.03-1.01 put spread, sell 1.05 call) and buy a bearish\n2-mo GBP/USD seagull (buy 1.57-1.55 put spread, sell 1.6250 call). Buy\nUSD/SEK in cash.\nCommodities\n�\n�\n�\nCommodities are up some 1% this week, led by precious metals, which\nrallied almost 4%. The strong gains in gold are probably due to the US\nelection result as Obama’s victory means no change to Fed policy and so\ncontinued QE and negative real yields. Gold also tends to gain when there is\nhigh fiscal uncertainty, just as it did last year during the acrimonious debt\nceiling debate which cost the US its AAA rating. We stay long gold.\nChinese economic data came out stronger than expected this week, providing\nsupport for our view that Chinese economic growth has bottomed and will\nrebound through next year. China’s slowing activity growth has been a major\ndrag on commodities over the last few years and the improving economy is\nwhat makes us long base metals.\nThe expected rebound in Chinese growth does not imply that we will go back\nto the double-digit growth rates that we saw before the crisis, and immediately\nafter. The periods when China’s economy grew at a pace above 8% coincided\nwith very strong price gains on commodities, as it boosted global demand.\nChina’s leadership is in the process of reorienting its economy towards\ndomestic consumption and to reduce reliance on exports and capital\ninvestments. As a result, Chinese growth will likely settle in a 7%-8% range\nover the medium term, a growth pace that in the past has not put upwards\npressure on commodity prices.\nFX weekly change in USD\n1.0%\n0.5%\n0.0%\n-0.5%\n-1.0%\nUSD\nTWI\nSource: J.P.

The 2018 contract implies a 4% decline in\ndividends paid from the 2016 level. In the absence of a recession, we think that is too\npessimistic — 2013 was the last year to see a material 2-year decline in dividends (in the\nwake of the sovereign crisis and recession). The 2018 contract also still trades at a\ndiscount to the level implied by our stock analysts’ DPS forecasts. Our derivative\nStrategists using BofAML forecasts for 2018 estimate 8% upside from current prices.\nAlthough the upside is now more limited the risk around this trade is also much lower\nnow. The pull to par effect will become the dominant driver over the coming months and\nthe full year results should provide clarity on where the 2018 contract will settle.\n\nBankofAmerica <2”\n\n18 Global Cross Asset Strategy - Year Ahead | 30 November 2016 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014449\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

My attorneys and PR people\nadvised me to just stay quiet, and it will all go away. I have received the same advice\nfor five years now. I realize my silence is now causing collateral damage to my\nfriends and other innocent bystanders. The time has come to let the hounds of\ninvestigative reporters loose on those that, driven by money, have made false\nclaims, concocted malicious fabrications, and have expanded their fictions now to\ninclude others in my orbit.\n\nI was investigated for soliciting underage prostitutes. To be precise, girls under the\nage of 18 who were brought to my house by their close friends who worked in local\nmassage parlors or strip clubs(West Palm Beach has scores of massage parlors and\nhappy ending places that routinely advertise in the same local papers that have\nchastised my behavior)| see Palm Beach Post classifieds]. 1 am and have always\nbeen a bachelor. eee massage parlor women, licensed massage therapists,\nand women with no massage experience. | have never ever used force, coercion, or\nin fact had intercourse with any of these women.\n\nWhen the police investigated me, went through my garbage, searched my house,\nthey found sex toys, but NO cameras or camera equipment; nothing in fact out of the\nordinary from many homes of single men. There were never any photos of\nunderage girls. Never. A careful reading of any law enforcement document makes\nthat clear. The camera that was referred to in the search warrant, was the camera\ninstalled in my house with the help of the local police to catch my houseman, John\nAllessi; the same houseman mentioned in many articles. He was breaking into my\nhouse and stealing money after being fired. The camera caught him in the act. These\ncameras were the only cameras at my house; security cameras.\n\nThe local state attorney, after conducting an extensive investigation and\ninterviewing the girls herself, a sex crimes prosecutor with over 13 years\nexperience, and who had herself authored the more tough legislations dealing with\nsex crimes, said in her own words, “There are no real victims here. The girls knew\nthey were going to a house in Palm Beach, they had their boyfriends or family\nmembers drive them to the house and wait outside, and then they encouraged their\nfriends to go.” Many of the girls interviewed were in their mid twenties, some in\ntheir early thirties, and some younger than 18. The girl that the newspapers have\nreferred to as a fourteen year old told the police that she had repeatedly told me\nthat she was 18 and a senior in high school, like many of the massage parlor girls\ntold me, and in her own words to the police, said the reason she said she was 18 was\nthat she was told if she didn’t, MR EPSTEIN would not let her in the house. These\nreports are available.\n\nThe state attorney offered me to take a plea to aggravated assault with only\nprobation. My attorneys told me that it would be forever a blight on my record, and |\nshould refuse the deal. I did so. The state attorney, Barry Krisher, took the unusual\nstep of bringing the facts before a state grand jury. In Florida, this happens most\noften in capital murder cases, not prostitution in someone’s own home. To be\ncertain that the public would not criticize the outcome, the state grand jury was\ngiven all the evidence and returned a verdict of Solicitation of Prostitution.\nSolicitation, a non-registrable offense which carries with it a sentence of mandatory\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025540\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We think there lies within this\nfervor potential for greater utilization of hemp derived textiles in apparel, footwear and\naccessories after largely being relegated to specialist brands with a few exceptions. The\nWestern Producer, a Western Canada weekly agriculture publication, commented that\n“industrial hemp could reach whole crop utilization” in an article published on 1/10/19\n“Revenue Streams Expand For Hemp Growers.” We think this compliments the\nsustainability movement that is gaining ground in global apparel and footwear\nproduction and among Millennial and Gen Z consumers.

In a vision processing\ncontext, for example, it allows for powerful unsupervised classification. If shown a variety o\nreal-world scenes, it will automatically form internal structures corresponding to the various\nnatural categories of objects shown in the scenes, such as trees, chairs, people, etc.; and also\nthe various natural categories of events it sees, such as reaching, pointing, falling. And, as wil\nbe discussed below, it can use feedback from DeSTIN’s action and critic networks to further\nshape its internal world-representation based on reinforcement signals.\n\nBenefits of DeSTIN for Perception Processing\n\nDeSTIN’s perceptual network offers multiple key attributes that render it more powerful than\nother deep machine learning approaches to sensory data processing:\n\n1. The belief space that is formed across the layers of the perceptual network inherently\ncaptures both spatial and temporal regularities in the data. Given that many applications\nrequire that temporal information be discovered for robust inference, this is a key advantage\nover existing schemes.\n\n2. Spatiotemporal regularities in the observations are captured in a coherent manner (rather\nthan being represented via two separate mechanisms)\n\n3. All processing is both top-down and bottom-up, and both hierarchical and heterarchical,\nbased on nonlinear feedback connections directing activity and modulating learning in mul-\ntiple directions through DeSTIN’s cortical circuits\n\n4, Support for multi-modal fusing is intrinsic within the framework, yielding a powerful state\ninference system for real-world, partially-observable settings.\n\n5. Each node is identical, which makes it easy to map the design to massively parallel platforms,\nsuch as graphics processing units.\n\nPoints 2-4 in the above list describe how DeSTIN’s perceptual network displays its own\n“cognitive synergy” in a way that fits naturally into the overall synergetic dynamics of the overall\nCogPrime architecture. Using this cognitive synergy, DeSTIN’s perceptual network addresses\na key aspect of general intelligence: the ability to robustly infer the state of the world, with\nwhich the system interacts, in an accurate and timely manner.\n\n4.3.1.3 DeSTIN for Action and Control\n\nDeSTIN’s perceptual network performs unsupervised world-modeling, which is a critical aspect\nof intelligence but of course is not the whole story. DeSTIN’s action network, coupled with the\nperceptual network, orchestrates actuator commands into complex movements, but also carries\nout other functions that are more cognitive in nature.\n\nFor instance, people learn to distinguish between cups and bowls in part via hearing other\npeople describe some objects as cups and others as bowls. To emulate this kind of learning,\nDeSTIN’s critic network provides positive or negative reinforcement signals based on whether\nthe action network has correctly identified a given object as a cup or a bowl, and this signal\nthen impacts the nodes in the action network. The critic network takes a simple external “degree\nof success or failure” signal and turns it into multiple reinforcement signals to be fed into the\nmultiple layers of the action network. The result is that the action network self-organizes so\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012987\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We won’t know until the data comes in, but we expect the same\nto happen this time.\n\n[5] The “Eye on the Market” has endlessly chronicled this year the fissures which are now affecting financial markets:\nEuropean sovereign risk and inadequate bank capitalization; weak labor compensation as an Achilles heel of the US\nprofits recovery, given its negative impact on spending; the political divide in Congress over how to deal with falling\ngovernment revenue and rising entitlement spending; inflation risks in Asia and Latin America and the resulting need for\nmore policy tightening; and the mixed track record of low interest rates to sustainability solve structural problems. The\ncover of the 2011 Outlook (a printing press, out of control) expressed our concern regarding a recovery built upon a\nstimulus machine. I would contrast this with the cover of a competitor’s 2011 publication, which had a picture of George\nWashington crossing the Delaware, with the caption “America’s structural resilience, fortitude and ingenuity will carry\nthe economy and financial markets in 2011 —- and beyond”. Our job is not to point to where we would like the\nfinancial markets to go, but rather to point to where they might end up. It’s like the scene in Oliver Stone’s Nixon,\nwhen Nixon looks up at a portrait of JFK and says, “When they look at you, they see what they want to be. When they look\nat me, they see what they are.” Our job is to see financial markets for what they are.\n\n[6] All that said, we have lessons to learn here.\n\nToo many of our investment discussions this year focused on the negative real return characteristics of\ncash, and why to reduce it. In a world of deflation risk on financial assets (rather than of goods and\nservices), cash retains substantial option value at times like these.\n\nWe could have connected the dots more aggressively on our views on weak growth and easy monetary\npolicy, and owned more gold. While we have had rising price forecasts for gold and owned it in\nportfolios, we did not have large enough allocations.\n\nGiven the all-time high of US government transfers to households and negative real interest rates, we\nshould not have interpreted positive economic data earlier this year as being highly representative of the\ntrue run-rate of the US economy. The same goes for the global economy, which has been the beneficiary\nof a lot of stimulus that is now fading, for a variety of economic and political reasons.\n\nGreat corporate profits are no guarantee against a problem in financial markets. Corporate profits and P/E\nmultiples were fine in June 2007, but rested on top of a systemic problem in private sector credit markets\nand private sector balance sheets. This year, strong corporate profits and low P/E multiples sit on top of\nsystemic problems in public sector finances.\n\n[7] In the wreckage, as usual, there are opportunities, and we will be reviewing them with you in the days ahead. There\nis a benefit to having held back on our firepower this year. With risk to spend held in reserve, there are oversold assets\nwith considering, particularly among multinationals with strong balance sheets, high dividends and which trade at very\nlow multiples, something we reviewed earlier in the week.”\n\nMichael Cembalest\nChief Investment Officer\n\nThe material contained herein is intended as a general market commentary.

Carry strategies are supposed to work better over long\ninvestment horizons, so that the cushion provided by the carry compensates for the\ncurrency volatility through mean reversion.\n\nHere, we analyze carry from a different perspective, as our goal is to identify standalone\nattractive carry opportunities. We define the investment horizon to end 1Q17. We sort\ncurrencies based on risk-adjusted carry. We then characterize the factor exposure of\ncurrency returns, isolating global and idiosyncratic sources of risks, in order to identify\nsmart carry trades that are not highly exposed to a massive re-pricing of global factors,\nsuch as US rates, USD, commodity prices and global risk aversion. We identify carry\ntrades that have low exposure to global factors, in particular the USD factor, and offer\nattractive risk-rewards.\n\nNot surprisingly, purely based on carry considerations, EM currencies appear more\nattractive than DM ones, which are mostly candidates for funding currencies. However,\ncarry trades returns are highly volatile, exhibit negative skewness and fat tails. Even\ncontrolling for different measures of risk such as volatility or maximum drawdown, and\naccording to this criteria only, we find that EM currencies are the most attractive, in\nparticular ARS, BRL in LatAm, RUB, TRY and ZAR in EEMEA and INR, IDR and CNY in\nAsia (Chart 63).\n\nEven though volatility and drawdowns can be useful measures of risk, they don’t say\nmuch about the exposure to different risk factors. Since carry trade strategies are\nusually very sensitive to global factors, we study the cross sectional exposure of\ncurrencies to key global factors: commodity prices, global risk aversion and US yields (as\na proxy of global yields}. We report the R2 of regressions of two years of weekly returns\non the above mentioned global factors, for the last two years and the years 2013-2014\nfor the sake of comparison (Chart 64).\n\nWe find that currencies in LatAm and EEMEA are more exposed to global factors than in\nAsia. Interestingly, LatAm and EMEA currencies are more sensitive to shocks in\ncommodity prices and risk aversion, while in Asia the shocks to monetary policy are the\nmost important ones (Chart 65). Within DM currencies, AUD and NOK are the two\ncurrencies most exposed to global factors. Ideally, we seek for currencies with high risk-\nadjusted carry and low exposure to global factors. Under such a metric, ARS, BRL, RUB\nand INR stand out as the best investment currencies, while EUR, CHF, JPY, KRW and\nTWD are the best funding currencies. However, this filter is not enough in the current\nvolatile environment.\n\nChart 64: LatAm is more exposed to global factors than Asia Chart 65: Sensitivity to global factors across regions\n08\n—\n06 Depend on global factors Normalized beta of global factors m Monetary\n06 = Commodities\n05 mw Equities\nmRSQ'6 @RSQ'14 04\n04\n0.2\n03\n02 0\n01 -0.2\nSS SEARS SOZESE SEAR AG OSE OH STE SHEE SLES SSSee2 aS Sd 2h SESS FAS GSE OR PaaS AES STSS\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nBankof America 2 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead| 16 November 2016 37\n\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014767\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I have to be \ndirect -- you or someone at your paper was very astute in checking the Clerk and Comptroller's computer \nand activity in the Epstein case two days before the hearing. As result, you sent me a text message on \nSaturday asking what the activity was about and I confirmed that the plea would take place. You were \nthe only member of the news media that I talked with. And yet, after the case is completely over, the \nPalm Beach Daily News' editorial staff remains silent on the topic. \nThanks, \nMike \nPalm Beach Post Editorial \nMonday, July 07, 2008 \nTwo years after a grand jury indicted him on a felony charge of solicitation of prostitution, Jeffrey Epstein \nfinally admitted that he lured a teenage girl to his $8.5 million, 13,000-square-foot Palm Beach mansion for \nsex. A week ago, the 55-year-old investment banker began serving 18 months in jail. \nBut that plea deal - guilty of felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring a person under the age of 18 for \nprostitution - does not account for all five of the girls, one as young as 14, who alleged that Epstein sexually \nabused them. And why is Epstein serving his term in the overcrowded Palm Beach County Jail and not a state \nprison, where inmates are sent if their sentences are longer than one year? \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030311 \nThe slow, dissatisfying resolution of the case sends a message to the public that there's a different system of \njustice for the wealthy who hire high-powered lawyers. Epstein's legal team included West Palm Beach defense \nattorney Jack Goldberger, Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz, who defended O.J. Simpson \nagainst murder charges, and Kenneth Starr, the prosecutor who pursued then-President Bill Clinton for lying \nabout sex with young women. \nPalm Beach police spent 11 months investigating Epstein before State Attorney Barry Krischer sent the case to \na grand jury, instead of charging Epstein so the man who once boasted of accepting only billionaire clients \ncould face a trial. The police had taken a high school transcript, class schedules and phone messages from \nEpstein's home that showed he knew the girls were underage. Yet Mr. Krischer was more swayed by Epstein's \nlawyers, who attempted to impugn the girls' character by showing they had chatted on myspace.com about \nsmoking marijuana and drinking. He should have let a jury decide whether the victims - and Epstein - were \ncredible. \nUltimately, one charge against Epstein finally reflected the age of one victim, and the plea agreement left \nEpstein labeled a sex offender. With that additional charge, if Epstein had been convicted at a trial, he could \nhave been sentenced to anything from probation to 15 years in prison, Assistant State Attorney Lanna \nBelohlavek said, adding that the recommended guideline sentence was 21 months. \nEpstein also won't have to certify to the court that he is receiving counseling, typically required of sex \noffenders, because he has a private psychiatrist. But without court supervision, who will ensure Epstein is in \nfact being treated? \nThe plea deal also drops a federal investigation of Epstein. If a federal investigation was warranted, how does \ndropping it before completion benefit the public? \nEpstein preyed on girls and denied it. For three years, his wealth and the influence of his lawyers bought him \nthe protection the state attorney owed to the victims. \nPolice chief's reputation helps discredit attacks \nBy Larry Keller  \nPalm Beach Post Staff Writer \nMonday, August 14, 2006 \nIn the case of Palm Beach financier Jeffrey Epstein, it seems, at times, as if two men are accused of \nwrongdoing: Epstein and Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter. \nEpstein, 53, was indicted last month on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution solely because of Reiter's \n\"craziness,\" one of Epstein's lawyers said. His department disseminated \"a distorted view of the case\" and \nbehaved in a \"childish\" manner when the grand jury didn't indict Epstein on the charges it sought, another \nEpstein lawyer complained. To hear the Epstein camp tell it, Reiter, 48, is a loose cannon better suited to be the \nsheriff of Mayberry. They whisper that he's embroiled in a messy divorce. \nReiter did in fact file for divorce from his wife, Jill, last year, after 24 years of marriage. They have a son, 18, \nand a daughter, 14. The couple is scheduled to go to mediation next week, Aug. 16. Nothing in the court file \nsuggests their split is particularly ugly. \nReiter incurred the wrath of the Epstein camp as well as the state attorney's office for two reasons. First, he \npressed for Epstein to be charged with the more serious crimes of sexual activity with minors. Second, he \nslammed State Attorney Barry Krischer in blunt language seldom used by one law-enforcement official \nconcerning another because of what he perceived as that office's mishandling of the case. \nIn a letter to Krischer written May 1, Reiter called his actions in the Epstein case \"highly unusual.\" He added, \n\"I must urge you to... consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your disqualification from the \nprosecution of these cases.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030312 \nIn short, Reiter told the county's top prosecutor for the past 13 years that he ought to get off the case. \"It looks \nlike a departure from professionalism,\" Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said of \nReiter's letter. \nFollowing Epstein's indictment, Reiter referred the case to the FBI to determine whether the super-rich, super-\nconnected defendant had violated any federal laws. \nReiter won't discuss the case or the broadsides aimed at him. But others almost uniformly use one word to \ndescribe the chief: professional. \n\"I have always been impressed by Mike's professionalism and his leadership,\" said Rick Lincoln, chief of the \nLantana Police Department and a Palm Beach County cop for 32 years. \n\"The town of Palm Beach has a very professional police department. We all consider Mike to be our peer and a \nman of integrity.\" \nJuno Beach Police Chief H.C. Clark II agreed. Although he doesn't know Reiter well, he has met with him on \ncountywide law enforcement issues. \"I've never seen him lose his cool. I've never seen anything but a \nprofessional demeanor from him.\" \nReiter joined the Palm Beach Police Department in 1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year patrol job at the University \nof Pittsburgh. His personnel jacket shows consistently excellent job evaluations. \nPosh Palm Beach is no hotbed of crime, and in his first year on the job, a resident confined to his home with a \nsick child thanked Reiter for delivering a few Cokes to the house. Reiter refused payment for the beverages. \nAnother resident thanked Reiter for shutting off his car's headlights in his driveway, saying a valet must have \nbeen at fault. \nReiter worked everything from road patrol to organized crime, vice and narcotics. And he's no novice at \ninvestigations involving the island's rich and famous. He was the lead detective probing the drug overdose \ndeath of David Kennedy in 1984. He also was one of the officers who worked the investigation of William \nKennedy Smith, who was charged in 1991 — and later acquitted — with raping a woman at the Kennedy \nfamily compound in Palm Beach. \nReiter, who has a master's degree in human resource development from Palm Beach Atlantic University, also \nhas attended the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Va., and management courses at Harvard. He's been \nactive in countywide interagency law enforcement organizations and has a \"top secret\" national security \nclearance. \n\"He has a perspective that's broader than just addressing the needs of the town,\" said Town Manager Peter \nElwell, who promoted Reiter from assistant chief to chief in March 2001. Reiter makes more than $144,000 as \nthe town's top cop. Elwell thinks he's worth it. \n\"He's very businesslike, very straightforward. He's not easily agitated or flamboyant. He's about the work,\" \nElwell said. \"I think that his service as chief has been outstanding in five-plus years.\" \n--\n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

I said I appreciated the contribution he’d made to the country, and\nthat we’d meet in the next few days to discuss how best to handle the political\ntransition. “Thanks,” Bibi said. “And again, mazaltov.”\n\nBy the time I got off the phone with Bibi, the TV was showing pictures of tens\nof thousands of people celebrating the results in the central Tel Aviv square, now\nrenamed in Rabin’s memory, where he had been murdered nearly four years\nearlier.

The schools are called the Bard High School Early College  \nschools (BHSEC) in Manhattan and Queens of New York City and in Newark, New Jersey. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026567 \nThe Bard schools are not charter schools. They are financed by New York State and New \nJersey. However, they run with the efficiency and success of a prominent charter school. \nThe schools are small, with less than 600 students each and a student teacher ratio of 20 \nto 1. Admission is academically exclusive, focusing on academic records, writing and math \nassessments and an eagerness for ideas and learning. And like most charter schools, the \nBHSEC schools critically have autonomy, even though they have to meet Regent state \nexams and state graduation guidelines. They have the autonomy to run their teaching \nstaff, budget, operations and curriculum. \nUnlike charter schools however, BHSEC schools provide an entire high school curriculum \nin just two years and then two years of college level credits. After four years, students \ngraduate with sixty college credits, a state Regents high school diploma and a Bard College \nAssociate in Arts degree in the liberal arts and sciences. This accelerated approach comes \nfrom the schools' belief that many young people are ready and eager to do serious college \nwork at age sixteen and that young adults' ambition to learn must be taken seriously. \nThe results have been exceptional: 95% of BHSEC graduates attend college. In July 2009, \nPresident Obama, addressing the NAACP's centennial convention cited the schools as a \nrole model for the nation: \"Innovations like Bard High School Early College and Medgar \nEvers College Preparatory School that are challenging students to complete high school \nand earn a free associate's degree or college credit in just four years.\" In 2012, The New \nYork Observer ranked BHSEC as the #1 public high school in New York City, with an A+ \ngrade, outranking the top private school. \nBHSEC has its roots in the college system. In June 2001, The New York City Board of \nEducation and Bard College created Bard High School Early College with the support of \nthe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Since the 1960's Bard College, originally called, \nBard College of Simon's Rock, was the nation's only four year college and was designed for \nyounger scholars. \n\"Competition is tough,\" Jeffrey Epstein notes, whose foundation actively supports public \neducation across the country. \"Approximately 7,000 applicants compete for 150 seats each \nfall. So we need to continue working with state education boards to duplicate this \nsuccessful model.\" \nhttp://www.jeffreyepstein.org \nSOURCE http://www.jeffreyepstein.org \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026568 \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

One\nof the girls Epstein, 54, was accused of soliciting massages from was described in court\ndocuments as being just 14.\n\n“E equals MC squared . . . get it, like the equation? E equals Epstein. He just thinks everyone is\ntoo dumb to figure it out,” said a model industry insider. “He’s a desperate old man that\nfantasizes and takes advantage of young girls.”\n\nThe trouble doesn’t stop there.\n\nKarins Models founder Brunel, who’s currently a partner in MC2, denied allegations in a 1997\n“60 Minutes” segment that he took advantage of young models who were high on drugs. Brunel\nalso reportedly left his Trump Tower digs in 1999 after complaints of night carousing, which he\nalso denied.\n\nDisgraced former Elite models exec Gerald Marie is also involved with MC2, says our source.\nMarie was accused of having sex with underage models in a 1999 BBC documentary where he\nwas filmed saying he hoped to seduce contestants in a modeling contest in which the average age\nof participants was 15. He also dated Linda Evangelista when she was a teen.\n\n““He’s also involved in the agency,” said the source. “Gerald and Jean-Luc like the same things.\nThey hang out because they have young girls in common, like two guys who enjoy the same\n\nwine,”\n\nMC2 president Jeffrey Fuller confirmed Brunel was a partner in the company, but denied any\nworking relationship with either Epstein or Marie.\n\n“We have no relationship business-wise with Gerald Marie. Jeffrey Epstein has no ownership or\ninvolvement in our company and never has. Jean-Luc Brunel and I are the only two partners and\n\nowners of MC2 Model Management,” Fuller said.\n\nEpstein’s rep said he was not involved in the agency. “He has no business relationship with\nthem,” said Howard Rubenstein.\n\n33\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011944\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Company A's stock is listed on a national U.S. stock\nexchange. In conducting its business internationally, Company A's officers and employees come into regular contact with\nforeign officials, including officials in various ministries and state-owned entities. At a trade show, Company A has a booth\nat which it offers free pens, hats, t-shirts, and other similar promotional items with Company A's logo. Company A also\nserves free coffee, other beverages, and snacks at the booth. Some of the visitors to the booth are foreign officials.\n\nls Company A in violation of the FCPA?\n\nNo. These are legitimate, bona fide expenditures made in connection with the promotion, demonstration, or\nexplanation of Company A's products or services. There is nothing to suggest corrupt intent here. The FCPA does not\nprevent companies from promoting their businesses in this way or providing legitimate hospitality, including to foreign\nofficials. Providing promotional items with company logos or free snacks as set forth above is an appropriate means of\nproviding hospitality and promoting business. Such conduct has never formed the basis for an FCPA enforcement action.\n\nAt the trade show, Company A invites a dozen current and prospective customers out for drinks, and pays\nthe moderate bar tab. Some of the current and prospective customers are foreign officials under the FCPA. Is\nCompany A in violation of the FCPA?\n\nNo. Again, the FCPA was not designed to prohibit all forms of hospitality to foreign officials. While the cost here may\nbe more substantial than the beverages, snacks, and promotional items provided at the booth, and the invitees specifically\nselected, there is still nothing to suggest corrupt intent.\n\nTwo years ago, Company A won a long-term contract to supply goods and services to the state-owned Electricity\nCommission in Foreign Country. The Electricity Commission is 100% owned, controlled, and operated by the\ngovernment of Foreign Country, and employees of the Electricity Commission are subject to Foreign Country's\ndomestic bribery laws. Some Company A executives are in Foreign Country for meetings with officials of the\nElectricity Commission. The General Manager of the Electricity Commission was recently married, and during the\ntrip Company A executives present a moderately priced crystal vase to the General Manager as a wedding gift\nand token of esteem. Ils Company A in violation of the FCPA?\n\nNo. It is appropriate to provide reasonable gifts to foreign officials as tokens of esteem or gratitude. It is important that\nsuch gifts be made openly and transparently, properly recorded in a company’s books and records, and given only where\n\nappropriate under local law, customary where given, and reasonable for the occasion.\n\nDuring the course of the contract described above, Company A periodically provides training to Electricity\nCommission employees at its facilities in Michigan. The training is paid for by the Electricity Commission as part of\nthe contract. Senior officials of the Electricity Commission inform Company A that they want to inspect the facilities\nand ensure that the training is working well. Company A pays for the airfare, hotel, and transportation for the\n\n(cont'd)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022519\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Similar to California,\nthe Maine Department of Health and Human Services appears to be following the FDA’s\nlead in determining that CBD is an unapproved food additive.\n\nState health inspectors in Maine have reportedly told businesses to remove “all foods,\ntinctures and capsules’ containing CBD from their shelves; however, business owners\ncan still sell “CBD products that can be smoked, vaped, worn as a patch or applied asa\nlotion, and all medical marijuana patients can still buy oral CBDs from licensed\ncaregivers or dispensaries.”\n\nNew York\n\nIn response to the 2018 Farm Bill, the New York State Department of Agriculture and\nMarkets issued a FAQ dated Dec. 18, 2018 on the manufacture and sale of hemp-\nderived CBD products. The department indicates that its current guidance is subject to\nchange and that it will likely be issuing additional regulations as the industry evolves.\n\nThe FAQ suggests that New York will allow the sale of CBD products sold as a topical or\ndietary supplement (pill or tincture), the latter of which runs counter to FDA’s current\nposition. However, the guidance appears to restrict CBD products for vaping/inhalation.\n\nAdditionally, New York will require licensure and prior written approval to produce and\nsell certain food and beverages under the New York State Industrial Hemp Research\nPilot Program. Licensees under the program can sell products that are “(1) listed in your\nResearch Plan and (2) produced in a facility meeting dietary-supplement GMP standards\nand (3) properly labeled and packaged for sale pursuant to FDA regulations for dietary\nsupplements, and (4) in compliance with all provisions of the Research Partner\nAgreement.”\n\nOtherwise, New York will restrict the manufacture and sale of ready-to-eat food and\nbeverage products with added CBD infusions or CBD extracts and lists products such as\n“CBD chocolate syrup, CBD soda, and CBD-infused frosting drizzled cookies.” In early\nFebruary, the New York Times reported that the New York Department of Health and\nMental Hygiene was beginning to more aggressively enforce this restriction in New York\nCity restaurants and eateries.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nThe North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services recently\nannounced its intent to issue warning letters to manufacturers and retailers who sell\nproducts containing CBD oil in the state. According to a Feb 8 press release, North\nCarolina will follow current federal laws, meaning that “CBD cannot legally be added to\nany human food or animal feed that is for sale,” as CBD is the active ingredient in an\nFDA-approved therapy and cannot be considered a dietary supplement.\n\nNorth Carolina intends to take an “educate before regulate stance with industry,”\naccording to the release. However, the state will “reserve the right to be more assertive”\nto ensure consumer health and safety, likely meaning product embargoes and seizures.\n\nCOWEN.COM 7\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024893\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

What would this\nmean for valuations? We think the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\ncould accelerate cost-benefit analyses and decision-\nmaking by management teams as a 21% federal tax rate vs.\n35% previously implies less tax leakage and less expense in\nmoving from single-layer taxation to a double taxation\nstructure. While investors would give up economics in the\nprocess, the new business structure would, we think, com-\nmand a higher valuation multiple.\n\nFor context, investor questions on the topic have picked up\nrecently, including from a number of long-only accounts, which\nhave historically avoided the Alts. Some investors have said they\ncurrently cannot invest in Alts given the partnership structure but\nwould be interested and able to do work on them if they were to con-\nvert to C-corps. We had conversations around conversion a year ago\nas President Trump took office amid promises of tax reform, and the\nsubject came up on nearly every 4Q16 earnings call. Management\nteams seemed to table the idea because of too many moving parts\nthat needed to be clarified before they conduct a proper cost/benefit\nanalysis. Post tax reform, conversion is at the top of investors@ninds\n\nand becomes a key debate/catalyst for the sector.\n\nWe believe Ares Management L.P. (ARES, Equal-weight) could be\nthe first Alt to convert to a C-corp, potentially sparking other\nconversions within our coverage. We believe this prospect has\nlikely driven much of the stock©24% return year-to-date and +16%\noutperformance vs. the S&P 500 and +10% its Alts peers. Over the\npast few months, ARES management has stated clearly that they\nhave been actively considered conversion. CFO Mike McFerran\nrecently told investors, \"This topic has become clearly very elevated\nin light of possible tax reform. Absent that and even before this\nbecame so topical, this is the thing we@e been thinking about. And\nthe overarching question is, can public traded partnerships attract\nthe breadth of shareholder base to support an appropriate valuation\nnotwithstanding some other obstacles.\" Even without tax reform,\nthe company was considering the structure change, and with a 21%\ncorporate statutory rate (vs. 35%), we believe cost-benefit analysis\nmay make sense for ARES. The company reports earnings on\nThursday, February 15, and we expect an update or additional\ncolor on conversion. We think all Alts shares could benefit as\ninvestors see a higher probability of others following in their\nfootsteps and/or investors re-rate AltsGRE higher.\n\nNORTH AMERICA INSIGHT ~~\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we@e created a conversion scorecard\nwith qualitative pros/cons for each company. To be clear, these are\nour views on where conversion makes the most sense and not calls on\nwhich companies will commit or the timing of potential conversions.\nWe focus selectively on the factors we view as most important in\n\ndeciding whether to convert.\n\ne FRE %ofEarningsD We believe the higher fee related earn-\nings as a % of total earnings, the more likely for a re-rating of\nthe shares and therefore more likely to consider C-corp con-\n\nversion.\n\ne Effective Tax Rate D The lower the current tax rate, the\nmore tax slippage if companies convert and are subject toa\nhigher corporate tax rate, and lower EPS. Conversely, compa-\nnies with a higher tax rate today already have more tax\nleakage, and thus could make sense to pay a little more tax in\n\na corporate structure for a broader investor base.\n\ne Current P/ERatioD The lower the current P/E multiple, the\nmore management may be inclined to take action to drive a\n\nre-rating.\n\n© Management Commentary D Lastly we look at manage-\nment commentary from earnings calls/conferences to assess\nthe extent that companies are evaluating conversion and seri-\n\nously considering it as a strategic option.\n\nExhibit 2:\nBased on our qualitative scorecard, our work suggests APO and ARES\nmay be most likely to convert\n\neee ae Core FRE % of JENIEffective Tax |Current P/E ratio | Management | Average Overall\npany 8 Earnings Rate (2018e) Commentary Score\n\nARES (ARES) Equal-weight © & of @ y |\nApollo (APO) Overweight a) »D D D ~dD\nOaktree (OAK) Overweight »D &B e »D Q\nKKR (KKR) Equal-weight ¢ © a) a Q\nCarlyle (CG) Overweight O a 2) 6 im )\nBlackstone (BX) Overweight »D & D D mY\n\nSource: Company Data, Morgan Stanley Research estimates\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025555\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Such AI weapons systems will be trained to operate and move along the\nmost invisible elements of our topologies, sometimes pulling violently at life support\ncords for currency or logistics or trade but also - perhaps more dangeroulsly - we\nwill find them insinuated into cognition systems we will come to depend upon,\nwhispering into our ears or tapping us on the shoulder “Look that way!” when in\nfact we should be gazing at some other gaping hole.

This is\nplaying out around us today. In the end, the people without the Seventh Sense will\nlose, because people who fight the future always lose. Then there will be a battle\nbetween different groups who have the Seventh Sense, each wired for different aims\nand instincts. Networks of terror taking on networks of bots. Gene adjusting health\nprotocols competing to become the platform of choice. This battle for the topological\nhigh-ground, where unimaginable profit, power and security linger, awaits us. If\nwe're lucky, it will unfold in a co-evolutionary way. Everyone will be better off. But\nthen, finally, there will be a contest between the winners of final topological mastery\nand the system itself. The Boxers against the Box. The AI machines will have the\nSeventh Sense, too.

It runs a crooked\ncourse. This work provides a paper trail of the meandering and rocky path of the peace\nprocess. Relevant documents related to the Arab-Israeli conflict over the past century\n(since the Sykes—Picot Agreement of 1916) are compiled in this book. It provides an\nannotated and chronological overview of attempts to make peace in one of the most\ndifficult and protracted conflicts in the world, and it includes a full set of accompanying\nmaps specially made for this edition.\n\nThe sheer volume of such a work raises the critical problem of how to present the\ndocuments in a way that facilitates their accessibility and understanding. A simple\nchronological ordering would miss important connections between the documents,\nwhich are thus better grouped by common theme. To this end, we have divided the\nvolume into five thematic Parts. Part I compiles documents related to the formal peace\nagreements between Israel and the Palestinians, as well as those related to Israel’s\nunilateral disengagement from Gaza. The documents in Part I] relate to the many\ninformal peace proposals and ideas offered over the years that have served to contribute\nto more official processes at a later date. Part III compiles the many important United\nNations documents specifically related to the question of Palestine. Part IV sets the\nIsraeli-Palestinian issue in a broader context, providing regional papers going back a\ncentury, up to the latest documents. Finally, Part V compiles Israeli and Palestinian\ndomestic documents relevant to the quest for peace in the Middle East.\n\nGrouping the documents by theme highlights the evolution of particular aspects of\nthe conflict and the peace process over time. When examined as a group, these\ndocuments provide valuable insights on the events, conditions, and actions that have\nbeen most important in influencing the different phases of the peace process.\n\nFor guidance, the reader will find a chronological overview of all the documents and\nkey events.\n\nON PART I: PEACE AGREEMENTS AND THE\nDISENGAGEMENT FROM GAZA\nNothing about the quest for peace in the Middle East has been simple or easily attained.\nMerely bringing Palestinians and Israelis together was a feat that took decades to\n\nachieve. Despite all the efforts exerted by not only the principal parties, but also local\nactors, regional neighbors, and international players, agreements between the two sides\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023161\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Under Atkins, the transition team posted a statement that it will be “working to\ndismantle the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with new policies to encourage economic\ngrowth and job creation.\" At this point there are no details on what parts of Dodd-Frank\nare most likely to be repealed, but Republican financial policy leaders appear pro-\nmarkets and have flagged free movement of capital via open markets as the best policy\nfor economic growth and risk transparency.\n\nThere are several dislocations across markets today that we think have a chance of\nnormalizing in the tail-risk event that deregulation results in increased availability of\nleverage and ability to take more risk. We have discussed these dislocations as resulting\nin part from the lack of ability of hedge funds and other relative-value traders to access\nenough balance sheet at a low enough cost to help these trades normalize. The top\ntrades we could see benefitting from the return of leverage would be:\n\ne« Normalization of swap spreads; balance-sheet intensive Treasuries, both nominal\nand TIPS, are very cheap versus OIS and Libor swap rates.\n\n« Normalization of cross-currency basis swaps, which currently allow USD-based\ninvestors the ability to buy very cheap EUR- and JPY-denominated assets via the\nbasis swap.\n\n¢ Normalization of coupon STRIPS versus principal STRIPS as these yield differentials\nare near their all-time wides, particularly in the 2030-38 maturity bucket.\n\nAs a tail risk for deregulation, we like buying 30y swap spreads, a credit-risk-free\nfloating-rate US Treasury asset that provides 3m Libor + 56bp annually, which is about\n100bp cheap to pre-crisis levels. Swap spreads could also benefit from deregulation that\nremoves cash and Treasury bonds from the leverage ratio requirements, which would\nprovide the ability of the dealer community to more easily absorb Treasury supply in the\nprimary and secondary markets.\n\nThe main risk is that policy changes retain strict capital requirements, which would\ncontinue to limit the availability of leverage. For example, the Financial Choice Act, a\nproduct of Texas Representative Jeb Hensarling's team, would provide banks an off-\nramp option to all Basel 3 requirements as long as banks hold a 10% capital ratio. This\nplan would probably decrease the availability of leverage, and could also result in\nreduced demand for short-dated Treasuries in HQLA portfolios. Another risk to 30y\nswap spread normalization in particular would be a material increase in deficit spending\nas part of a fiscal stimulus package. This would likely further cheapen Treasuries versus\nswaps and other benchmark interest rates.\n\nTrade recommendation: Buy 30y Treasuries versus 30y matched Libor swap at\n3mL+56bp. Target 3mL + Obp, stop loss 3mL+75bp.\n\nTail risk 2: Comeback of Eurozone risk premia\n\nEZ risk hedges: 30s50s flatteners in BTPs, buy EUR/HUF vol\n\nIn Europe, the biggest market risk for 2017 is arguably a comeback of stress on\nperipheral sovereigns. The next 12 months provide plenty of triggers, with increasing\nconcerns about the ability of ECB to continue with QE, and an intense political season\nahead (referendum in Italy on 4 Dec, and elections in France and Germany in 2017).\n\nAs hedges to Eurozone risks, we recommend buying 30s50s flatteners in BTPs as the\ncheapest way to express a bearish view on the periphery, and buying EUR/HUF vol as a\nproxy for Euro instability with better pricing than EUR/USD vol.\n\nConcerns on EU politics and the ECB would likely lead to a switch of market focus from\nmonetary policy to fundamentals. The periphery would be hurt by this new focus: public\ndebt to GDP remains very high, and the low debt service costs enjoyed in the past five\nyears favored debt accumulation, rather than debt reduction (Chart 73).

We\ncall this axis \"interactivity\"’, and what we are referring to is the frequency of high-information-\ncontent, high-influence interaction between the neural and symbolic components in the hybrid\nsystem. In a low-interaction hybrid system, the neural and symbolic components don’t exchange\nlarge amounts of mutually influential information all that frequently, and basically act like\nindependent system components that do their learning/reasoning /thinking periodically sending\neach other their conclusions. In some cases, interaction may be asymmetric: one component may\nfrequently send a lot of influential information to the other, but not vice versa. However, our\nhypothesis is that the most capable neural-symbolic systems are going to be the symmetrically\nhighly interactive ones.\n\nIn a symmetric high-interaction hybrid neural-symbolic system, the neural and symbolic\ncomponents exchange influential information sufficiently frequently that each one plays a major\nrole in the other one’s learning /reasoning/thinking processes. Thus, the learning processes of\neach component must be considered as part of the overall dynamic of the hybrid system. The\ntwo components aren’t just feeding their outputs to each other as inputs, they’re mutually\nguiding each others’ internal processing.\n\nOne can make a speculative argument for the relevance of this kind of architecture to neuro-\nscience. It seems plausible that this kind of neural-symbolic system roughly emulates the kind\nof interaction that exists between the brain’s neural subsystems implementing localist symbolic\nprocessing, and the brain’s neural subsystems implementing globalist, classically “connection-\nist” processing. It seems most likely that, in the brain, symbolic functionality emerges from\nan underlying layer of neural dynamics. However, it is also reasonable to conjecture that this\nsymbolic functionality is confined to a functionally distinct subsystem of the brain, which then\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012993\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It came in the form of a message from one of its best placed moles in the Russian\nintelligence service. This surreptitious source was Alexander Poteyev, a 54-year old colonel in the\nSVR, which was the successor agency to the First Chief Directorate of the KGB. While the FSB\ntook over the KGB’s domestic role in December 1991, the SVR became Russia's Foreign\nIntelligence Service. Its operation center was in the Yasenevo district of Moscow. The CIA had\nrecruited Poteyev as its mole in the 1990s when he had been stationed at the Russian Embassy in\nWashington DC. That it could sustain a mole in Moscow for over a decade attested to its\ncapabilities in the espionage business. After he returned to Moscow, still secretly on the CIA’s\npayroll, he became the deputy chief of the SVR’s “American” section. This unit of Russian\nintelligence had the primary responsibility for establishing spies in CIA, FBI, NSA and other\nAmerican intelligence agencies.\n\nThe SVR’s last known (or caught) mole in US Intelligence was CIA officer Harold Nicholson\nin 1996. Before it could now expand its espionage capabilities. It needed to build a network of\nRussian sleeper agents in the United States. For this network, it needed to groom so-called\n“illegals,” or agents who were not connected to the Russian Embassy. This so-called “illegals”\nnetwork was necessary since presumably all Russian diplomats, including the so-called “legal”\nmembers of Russian intelligence, were under constant surveillance by the FBI. Advances in\nsurveillance technology in the 21“ century had made it increasingly difficult to communicate with\nrecruit through its diplomatic missions. To evade it, the “American” division of the SVR was\ngiven the task of placing individuals in the United States disguised as ordinary Americans. Their\n“legend,” or operational cover, could be thin since they would not be applying for jobs in the\ngovernment.

Unlike the SVR’s “legal” officers, who were attached to Russian\nembassies as diplomats and were protected from arrest by the Treaty of Vienna, the SVR’s illegal\nagents lack diplomatic immunity. According to Pavel Sudoplatov, who defected from the KGB in\nthe Cold War, the sole job of such sleeper agents was to “live under cover in the West awaiting\nassignments for the Center.” One assignment that justifies the expense of maintaining such\nagents is to service a penetration, after one is made, in the US intelligence establishment.

Hospitals would be under pressure to be more flexible on prices to avoid any\npressure should lower-cost packages impact their volumes.\n\nVision implies a long process\nTo us, the government's vision implies a two stage process over a long time-frame:\n\ne Inthe short-term: improve the quality of care offered in the public sector,\npotentially with the assistance of private healthcare\n\ne In the long-term: Only when public facilities have improved, privatise such facilities\n(although one medical city is to be privatised under a public-private partnership)\n\ne Concurrently: Prepare for a roll-out of private health insurance to finance private\nprovision\n\nAbu Dhabi and Dubai are probably not parallels\n\nIn Abu Dhabi and Dubai, private healthcare was encouraged to avoid expats relying on\npublic facilities. The large expat population in proportion to the locals (85:15) supported\nthe creation of private facilities that it was then possible for the governments to fully\nfund Emiratis to use. The quality of public facilities was not a cause for concern - many\nEmiratis still prefer to use government facilities for more serious problems.\n\nExpat population and quality of public system differ in Saudi\n\nThe proportion of expats (33% of the population) is not large enough to drive the\nestablishment of a large, high quality private hospital base sufficient to serve the entire\nSaudi population. Additionally, the quality of both care and infrastructure in the public\nsystem is seen as lacking, suggesting additional investment in facilities is required.\n\nDegree to which private sector will benefit is uncertain\n\nGiven the lack of detail provided to date, it is hard to assess the benefits, or risks to the\nincumbent private hospital operators in detail. We see two main ways the private sector\ncan participate in healthcare reform:\n\ne Win contracts to run and improve public health facilities\ne Benefit from volume growth any roll-out of private health insurance could spur\n\ne Participate in privatisations\n\nIn the long-term, volumes up but pricing down, likely to benefit nonetheless\n\nAt present there is limited supply of quality private hospitals and the incumbents are in\na strong bargaining position with insurers. Greater private hospital supply, and\ncompetition, would likely pressure pricing, and margins in the longer-term, albeit offset\nby increased volumes. Assuming only basic services are offered to most citizens under\nany government-driven scheme, there would still be a place for offering higher-quality\naccommodation for example, to higher-income patients.\n\nPrivate sector could win public hospital contracts\n\nPrivate operators could be allocated management contracts for public hospitals to\nimprove efficiency of existing hospitals, train public sector administrators and raise\nclinical standards. Presumably reimbursement under such contracts would be based on a\nfixed fee, potentially with performance clauses for improved outcomes or lowering\ncosts. More substantive contracts, where the private operator is responsible for all\naspects of operating the hospital could be more accretive, but bring greater financial\nrisk.\n\n54 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 3S Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016164\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

This\nspeed did produce things very like science fiction: Accurate voice recognition. Real-\ntime genetics. And it also began to mark out, clearly, the powerful network territory\nwhere our future will be decided.\n\n<P\n\nOf all the things that mark a change between our modern lives and the days of those\nwho came before us, few are as sensationally obvious as the sheer acceleration of\nlife, the reduction of delay and the emerging instantness of experience. Faster. What\nis going on inside the machines, as Mel Conway’s old law would have told us, is\nhappening too on the surface of our lives. A feeling of breathlessness in the face of\nspeed isn’t new, of course. When Anna Karenina folds herself under an oncoming\ntrain at the end of Tolstoy’s novel, for instance, her suicide is as much metaphor as\npersonal tragedy, a comment on the disorienting steam, engine, and rail pace of\nmodernity. Speed kills, old habits and ideas particularly. Between 1840 and 1940\ntravel times between Anna’s St. Petersburg and Vronsky’s Moscow shrunk by 10\nminutes every year on average, loosing deep cracks in Russian economics and\npolitics, tearing apart Anna’s slow-moving world of glittering balls and hereditary\nestates with the fast force of industry, modernity and then the awful pliers of\ncommunism. Tolstoy’s own death in 1910 held a bit of this acute tension between\nold and new velocities: At 82, hoping to live out his final days in the peace of a small\nhut, he left his family for the rural Russian town of Sharmardino. By train. He died at\na station on the way, stopped quite literally, like an absurd figure in a Gogol novel, as\nhe was enacting the tragedy of trying to use the modern to get to the past.\n\nAt the same time in the late 19 Century, the American rail system was working its\nown transformation, but with almost no ambivalence. America was using the\nmodern to get to the future - as fast as possible. This was a decisive difference in\ntemperament. “The American frontier,” Frederick Jackson Turner wrote in his\nfamous 1894 essay about borders and American life, “is sharply distinguished from\nthe European frontier—a fortified boundary line running through dense\npopulations.”1% American rails and roads (and trade) encountered no substantial\nfortifications. They ran nearly unchecked into the wilderness. The only apparent\nlimit to expansion, that generation thought, was technology itself. The trains had,\nfrom the start, an unusual purchase in American life. During the three decades after\n1840, the refinement of small but important details - faster train engines, stiffer\ncarriage design, tracks that were straighter, an ability to move and re-load boxcars\nat night, better time-table management - eased America into the steam engine age\n\n193 You can solve: Adam Beberg lecture “Distributed Systems: Computation with a\nmillion friends”, speech at Stanford University Computer Systems Colloquium (April\n30, 2008) available online\n\n195 “The American frontier”: Frederick Jackson Turner, “The Significance of the\nFrontier in American History”, The Annual Report of the American Historical\nAssociation, 1894, pp. 119-227\n\n135\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018367\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Social connection depends\nin part on empathic responses to\nobserved action. It has been argued that\nthis same foundation is the basis for the\nevolution of language as well--observed\naction may be the foundation for\nlanguage.”\n\nA mirror neuron theory of the\nevolution of language starts with the\nassumption that we understand others by\nobserving their actions. Communication\ndepends on the regularization of typical\nactions that can be pantomimed. In\nprinciple this could lead to a kind of\nmanual gestural system of\ncommunication akin to sign language.\nHand and arm movements can depict a\nwide range of actions both by first-\nperson depiction of an action such as\nscrewing the top onto a jar and by third-\nperson depictions such as using the\nfingers to portray a person walking.\nHand and arm postures can depict\nobjects such as a cupped hand\nrepresenting a bowl. Combining\nsequences of such object and action\ndepictions can communicate relatively\ncomplex messages even without a\nformal language. This is a far cry from\nsign languages in which the mapping\nbetween hand shapes and movements is\nnot visually transparent in this way. But\nas the pressure to communicate a\nbroader range of messages increases, a\nmanual gestural language would have to\nbe modified to reflect more abstract\n\nPage |71\n\nsymbols ultimately leading in the\ndirection of a sign language.\n\nHowever, this kind of manual\nlanguage has one major drawback.\nCommunication depends on visual\ncontact. In order to understand a\ngestural message it is necessary to see\nthe hand movements. This limits the\ndistances over which communication can\ntake place. Moreover, a communication\nsystem that is effective for a group\nshould not depend on face-to-face\ndyadic interaction, but allow for more\nbroadcast communications. There is a\ngreat survival advantage in being able to\nmaintain social connection and convey\ninformation over distances that go well\nbeyond face-to-face communication.\n\nMany species of fish,\namphibians, reptiles, birds, and\nmammals commonly exchange\ninformation at a distance through\nvocalizations. The learned songs (and\nsome calls) of songbirds are particularly\nrich sources of information conveying,\nto the receiver, individual identity and a\nhost of other characteristics of the\nsender. Some mammals exchange\ninformation at great distances through\ncalling behavior. Humpback whale\nvocalizations are perceived over\nextremely long distances and may be\nused to maintain social groups at\ndistances as great as 5 km. African\nelephants can recognize friends and\nrelatives from their calls at a distance of\n2.5 km. Human sheepherders keep each\nother company from the top of one\nmountain to another in the Canary\nIslands using a whistled language called\nSilbo Gomero. Whether for purposes of\nmating, threat, warning, or social\norganization, conveying information\nregarding location, identity and\nmotivation, and directed at one\nindividual or towards far-flung groups,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021317\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The lamp has a built-in solar\npanel to charge its four AA-sized batteries.\n\nThe lantern has an obvious advantage over kerosone-fuelled equivalents: with no flame or smoke emissions, it is safer and\nmore environmentally friendly. The batteries are made for 500 cycles, or about two years, but the longevity of the lamps in\nEthiopia has come as a pleasant surprise. In a novel twist, the lantern, which costs $38 (£24.50), can also be used to charge\nmobile phones.\n\nThe award provided a huge fillip for Thakkar's company, Sunlite. As word spread, relief agencies placed increasingly large\norders. About 100,000 of the lamps have been (or are being) used after emergencies in Japan, the Philippines, Thailand and\nSyria.\n\nSunlite makes 15,000 lamps a month at two plants in India, including one in a special economic zone in Gujarat state.\n\nNext month, there will be a new winner at AidEx in Brussels, the third year of the award. The innovation award sits alongside\na crowded field of honours in the development world, although AidEx is geared more towards humanitarian needs.\n\nAwards seem to be proliferating. Last month, 53 finalists met in Washington to showcase ideas to save the lives of mothers\nand newborns in developing countries. The award is given by the Saving Lives at Birth partnership, launched in 2011, which\nincludes USAid, Norway, Grand Challenges Canada, backed by the Canadian government, the UK's Department for\nInternational Development, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nIn October, the Mo Ibrahim foundation will announce its prize for achievement in African leadership, established in 2007.\nPast winners include presidents Joaquim Chissano and Festus Gontebanye Mogae, of Mozambique and Botswana\nrespectively, although the prize is not awarded if no one meets the criteria.\n\nSceptics may wonder whether these accolades contribute meaningfully to development, or exist only to make donors feel\ngood while sidestepping more fundamental, structural issues. Forinstance, the Gates foundation awarded $100,000 to the\nCalifornia Institute of Technology last year for designing a solar-powered toilet that breaks down water and human waste\ninto hydrogen gas for use in fuel cells.\n\nThe competition was for \"next-generation\" toilets to improve sanitation in the developing world. Would that money have\n\nbeen better spent on supporting community-led total sanitation — a project to end open defecation that has had considerable\nsuccess?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019430\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He pointed to\ndocumented evidence that proves he is innocent.\n“I can prove conclusively that she made the whole thing up,”\nDershowitz said, citing travel records that he says prove where he\nwas at the time she claims she had sex with him. “It’s conclusive,\nconclusive evidence.”\n“More importantly, I can prove where I wasn’t,” he said, after stating\noutright, “Never met her, don’t know who she is, never heard of her.”\nSimilarly, Dershowitz said that Roberts claimed that notable figures\nsuch as Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Tipper Gore were present on an\nhttps://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/dershowitz-goes-off-on-woman-who-made-underage-...\n4/3/2019\nDershowitz Goes Off on Woman Who Made Underage Sex Allegations: 'She Should Be ...\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-4 Filed 04/16/19 Page 3 of 4\nPage 2 of 3\nisland, when Secret Service records proved they were never even\nthere.\nDershowitz said Roberts’ allegations were part of an extortion plot,\nand that she “should be seriously punished for submitting false\ninformation and a false affidavit.”\nThe attorney emphasized that Roberts has not been willing to repeat\nher allegations against him in public, and that she has only accused\nhim in the context of litigation, which affords certain protections.\nAdvertisement\n“She simply hides behind litigation privileges,” Dershowitz said,\nencouraging Ross to call Roberts and see if she would repeat her\nclaims. “And if she does, I will be in court the next day suing her for\ndefamation and I will win the case ’cause I can prove conclusively\nthat she made up the whole story from top to bottom.”\nRoss then turned to the controversial deal that Epstein received from\nfederal prosecutors who were investigating the trafficking case\nagainst him. Federal prosecutors agreed not to prosecute him, and let\nhim plead guilty to state charges that resulted in a 13-month prison\nsentence that allowed Epstein to leave prison during the day for\nwork. Federal prosecutors allegedly did not even inform victims\nbefore making the deal, which is now the subject of a request for an\nInspector General investigation. Congressional Democrats said in a\nletter that they want to know more about the circumstances\nsurrounding the deal, which was made by then-U.S. Attorney and\ncurrent Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta.\nAs Epstein’s defense attorney in that case, Dershowitz is not upset\nabout it the deal at all.\n“I’m very proud of that deal, that’s what lawyers are supposed to do,”\nhe said. “Lawyers are supposed to get the best deals they can.” If he\ncould have gotten 10 months or no time at all, that would have been\neven better, he said.\nAcosta said in the past that Epstein’s lawyers, including Dershowitz,\nput pressure on his office by investigating his staff. Dershowitz has\ndenied this.\n“Acosta was very tough,” Dershowitz said, contrary to concerns that\nhe did anything improper.

The various cannabinoids and terpenes in a particular can-\nnabis plant are believed to work synergistically with each other and with the human endocannabinoid\nsystem to create an effect very different from the effect any one compound would create. This phenom-\nenon may partially explain why different cannabis strains are used to treat diverse medical conditions.\n\nThere are several generally accepted examples of the entourage effect. CBD is believed to regulate\nthe psychoactive effects of THC and reduce short-term memory loss, sleepiness and paranoia that may\nbe caused by THC. Myrcene is understood to enable and hasten the psychoactive effect of THC by\nlowering resistance posed by the blood-brain barrier and increasing the THC saturation capacity of the\nCB1 receptors. Other terpenes have been shown to block endocannabinoid receptors in the brain while\npromoting bonding by endocannabinoid receptors located elsewhere in the body.\n\nMany cannabinoid and terpene formulations developed for therapeutic applications are created\nby combining extracts from multiple cannabis strains, a process known as “Frankensteining.” Some\nbelieve Frankenstein formulations are less effective than formulations developed from a single strain\nbecause the natural balance of compounds in a single strain translates to a naturally balanced effect on\nthe human body.\n\nAn understanding of entourage effects and how to effectively combine cannabinoids and terpenes\nis believed to be critical to the development of targeted cannabis therapies.

That case involved special circumstances,\nnamely, severely limited pre-acquisition due diligence available to the potential acquiring company, and, because\nit was an opinion release (i.e., providing certain assurances by DOJ concerning prospective conduct), it necessarily\nimposed demanding standards and prescriptive timeframes in return for specific assurances from DOJ, which\nSEC, as a matter of discretion, also honors. Thus, obtaining an opinion from DOJ can be a good way to address\nspecific due diligence challenges, but, because of the nature of such an opinion, it will likely contain more stringent\nrequirements than may be necessary in all circumstances.\n\nM&A Risk-Based FCPA Due Diligence and Disclosure: As a practical matter, most acquisitions will typically not\nrequire the type of prospective assurances contained in an opinion from DOJ. DOJ and SEC encourage companies\nengaging in mergers and acquisitions to: (1) conduct thorough risk-based FCPA and anti-corruption due diligence\non potential new business acquisitions; (2) ensure that the acquiring company’s code of conduct and compliance\npolicies and procedures regarding the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws apply as quickly as is practicable to\nnewly acquired businesses or merged entities; (3) train the directors, officers, and employees of newly acquired\nbusinesses or merged entities, and when appropriate, train agents and business partners, on the FCPA and other\nrelevant anti-corruption laws and the company’s code of conduct and compliance policies and procedures; (4)\nconduct an FCPA-specific audit of all newly acquired or merged businesses as quickly as practicable; and (5) disclose\nany corrupt payments discovered as part of its due diligence of newly acquired entities or merged entities. DOJ\nand SEC will give meaningful credit to companies who undertake these actions, and, in appropriate circumstances,\nDOJ and SEC may consequently decline to bring enforcement actions.\n\nbribery—both the new entity and the foreign subsidiaries\nwere liable under the FCPA. The new parent entered into\na non-prosecution agreement with DOJ and settled a civil\naction with SEC, while the company’s subsidiaries, which\nalso merged, pleaded guilty.'*\n\nMore often, DOJ and SEC have pursued enforce-\nment actions against the predecessor company (rather\nthan the acquiring company), particularly when the\nacquiring company uncovered and timely remedied the\nviolations or when the government’s investigation of\nthe predecessor company preceded the acquisition. In\none such case, an Ohio-based health care company’s due\ndiligence of an acquisition target uncovered FCPA vio-\nlations by the target’s subsidiary, and, before the merger\nwas completed, the subsidiary’s violations were disclosed\nto DOJ and SEC. The subsidiary pleaded guilty and\n139\n\npaid a $2 million criminal fine,\n\nsettled with SEC and paid a $500,000 civil penalty,’”\n\nthe acquisition target\n\nand no successor liability was sought against the acquir-\ning entity. In another case, a Pennsylvania-based issuer\nthat supplied heating and air conditioning products and\nservices was subject to an ongoing investigation by DOJ\nand SEC at the time that it was acquired; DOJ and SEC\nresolved enforcement actions only against the predecessor\ncompany, which had by that time become a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of the successor company..”!\n\nDOJand SEC have also brought actions only against a\npredecessor company where its FCPA violations are discov-\nered after acquisition. For example, when a Florida-based\nUS. company discovered in post-acquisition due diligence\nthat the telecommunications company (a domestic con-\ncern) it had acquired had engaged in foreign bribery, the\nsuccessor company disclosed the FCPA violations to DOJ.\nIt then conducted an internal investigation, cooperated\nfully with DOJ, and took appropriate remedial action—\n\nincluding terminating senior management at the acquired\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022531\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We live in an\nhistoric era, not least because the connections that define our age means epochal\nquakes in one part of the system will rattle other bits too.\n\nA feeling for history — Nietzche’s old “Sixth Sense” - should fire up invisibly in us bit\nnow as we think about what life in an historic age might mean for us. The surprises\nin our news every day. The creaking of our old institutions. What do they augur? The\npolitical scientists Charles S. Gochman and Zeev Maoz once made a survey of history\nto see if they could spot just when the world slipped from calm moments to\nepochally unettled ones. They surveyed nearly 1,000 wars, big and small, hunting\nfor patterns as you or! might look for trends in stock prices or sports scores.\nIncreasing complexity, they discovered, almost always shook the world into conflict.\nStates, armies, political groups, newly independent nations, ideological and religious\nforces emerge and then collide in their young energy, each driven by different aims\nand values and dreams. A cycle marks the process. First, disputes over small matters\naccelerate — as they are doing now. Everything seems open to question: Do you\ncontrol this trade route? Who says we have to respect this arms limit? The\ncombined pressure of so many simultaneous disagreements announces a shift in the\npattern of all relations. A logical loop follows: “The frequency of disputes,” Gochman\nand Moaz explain, “appears to be an early indicator of system transformation...The\nrise in the number of disputes seems to indicate a decline in the degree of consensus\non the ‘rules’ of the international order. This heightened dissensus (often\nculminating in large-scale wars) is followed by restructuring.”**! Pressure on the\nrules. Small cracks. Large scale war. Re-ordering. Like water moving from ice to\nliquid to steam and back, this cycle has a predictable logic. It ran in the age of\nBismarck and culminated in World War One. It spun again in the age between last\ncentury’s great wars too, tripping into a second World War. And it ran as well in the\n\n240 “What are”: Richard Hamming, “You and Your Research”, Simula Research\nLaboratory (Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 2010) Chapter 6\n\n241 The politial scientists: Charles S.

Rev. 835, *865\n\nFurthermore, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure already direct executive branch actions less directly connected to court\nhearings. For instance, Rule 16 directs that prosecutors must turn over various discoverable items to the defendant. '47 Rule 41\ndirects federal agents serving a warrant to leave a copy for the person whose premises are searched. !4% And, most\ncontroversially, Rule 5 directs that federal agents making an arrest \"must take the defendant without unnecessary delay\" before\na judicial officer. '49 The kinds of rule changes discussed in this Article are far less invasive than these commands. Finally, it\nshould be remembered that federal prosecutors serve as \"officers of the court.\" !°° In that capacity, the court can be reasonably\nexpected to facilitate victims’ involvement in the criminal justice process. !°!

Before accepting a plea of nolo contendere, the court must consider the parties’ and victims’ views\nand the public interest in the effective administration of justice.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nAs discussed at greater length in the immediately following sections, the CVRA gives victims the right to be heard regarding\nany plea, presumably including any nolo contendere plea. It is a natural corollary that the court should consider the victim's\nviews before accepting any such plea.\n\nRule 11(b)(4) - Victims' Right To Be Heard on Pleas\nThe Proposal:\n\nThe court should address any victim present in court when taking a plea in order to determine whether the victim wishes to\nmake a statement and to consider the victim's view before accepting a plea as follows:\n\n(4)[cfn ]Victims’ Views. Before the court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or allows any plea to be withdrawn, the\ncourt must address any victim who is present personally in open court. During this address, the court must determine whether\nthe victim wishes to present views regarding the proposed plea or withdrawal and, if so, what those views are. The court shall\nconsider the victim's views in acting on the proposed plea or withdrawal.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nThe CVRA gives victims the right \"to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving ...

Kozeny, et al.\n\nIn December 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit upheld a conscious avoidance\ninstruction given during the 2009 trial of a businessman\nwho was convicted of conspiring to violate the FCPA’s\nanti-bribery provisions by agreeing to make payments to\nAzeri officials in a scheme to encourage the privatization\nof the Azerbaijan Republic’s state oil company. The\ncourt of appeals found that the instruction did not lack\na factual predicate, citing evidence and testimony at\ntrial demonstrating that the defendant knew corruption\nwas pervasive in Azerbaijan; that he was aware of his\nbusiness partner’s reputation for misconduct; that he\nhad created two U.S. companies in order to shield\nhimself and other investors from potential liability for\npayments made in violation of the FCPA; and that the\ndefendant expressed concerns during a conference call\nabout whether his business partner and company were\nbribing officials.\n\nThe court of appeals also rejected the defendant's\ncontention that the conscious avoidance charge had\nimproperly permitted the jury to convict him based on\nnegligence, explaining that ample evidence in the record\nshowed that the defendant had “serious concerns”\nabout the legality of his partner’s business practices\n“and worked to avoid learning exactly what [he] was\ndoing,” and noting that the district court had specifically\ninstructed the jury not to convict based on negligence.\n\nWhat Affirmative Defenses Are\nAvailable?\n\nThe FCPA’ anti-bribery provisions contain two affir-\nmative defenses: (1) that the payment was lawful under the\nwritten laws of the foreign country (the “local law” defense),\nand (2) that the money was spent as part of demonstrating a\nproduct or performing a contractual obligation (the “reason-\nable and bona fide business expenditure” defense). Because\nthese are affirmative defenses, the defendant bears the burden\n\nof proving them.\n\nThe Local Law Defense\n\nFor the local law defense to apply, a defendant must\nestablish that “the payment, gift, offer, or promise of any-\nthing of value that was made, was lawful under the writ-\nten laws and regulations of the foreign official’s, political\nparty’s, party official's, or candidate’s country.’“! The defen-\ndant must establish that the payment was lawful under the\nforeign country’s written laws and regulations at the time\nof the offense. In creating the local law defense in 1988,\nCongress sought “to make clear that the absence of written\nlaws in a foreign official’s country would not by itself be suf\nficient to satisfy this defense.” Thus, the fact that bribes\nmay not be prosecuted under local law is insufficient to\nestablish the defense. In practice, the local law defense arises\ninfrequently, as the written laws and regulations of coun-\ntries rarely, if ever, permit corrupt payments. Nevertheless,\nif a defendant can establish that conduct that otherwise\nfalls within the scope of the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions\nwas lawful under written, local law, he or she would have a\ndefense to prosecution.\n\nIn United States v. Kozeny, the defendant unsuccess-\nfully sought to assert the local law defense regarding the law\nof Azerbaijan. The parties disputed the contents and appli-\ncability of Azeri law, and each presented expert reports and\ntestimony on behalf of their conflicting interpretations. The\ncourt ruled that the defendant could not invoke the FCPA’s\naffirmative defense because Azeri law did not actually legal-\nize the bribe payment. The court concluded that an excep-\n\ntion under Azeri law relieving bribe payors who voluntarily\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022525\n\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We\nexpect EM FX to appreciate against the USD from current levels over a six-month horizon.\ne As expected, China has started to ease monetary policy. We believe there is also room to do more on the\nfiscal side, helping to support China's economic growth outlook for the second half of 2012 and into 2013.\nThe 2Q GDP numbers are expected to represent the low point in the current cycle.\n¢ Given the above, in our base case, we see scope for some multiple expansion for the MSCI EM Index,\nfrom the current 10.3x realized price-to-earnings ratio to closer to 11x over the next six months. We expect\nearnings growth of around 10% over the next 12 months.\n¢ Within EM, we believe that Asia is best positioned for economic growth in the second half of 2012. In\nemerging Asia, we prefer China. In Latin America, we prefer Brazil and Mexico. Central and Eastern\nEurope remains the most vulnerable region, and we remain neutral on Russia.\n4 Positive scenario MSCI EM (6-month target): 1,190\ne The outlook for the global economy improves, boosting EM's ability to grow more strongly in 2013.\nStronger economic growth leads to earnings growth of 15%. Investor confidence improves, leading to a\nbetter P/E multiple of 12.5x trailing earnings. More cyclical Korea and Taiwan would benefit.\n\n& Negative scenario MSCI EM (6-month target): 730\n\ne Serious negative developments (e.g. a further deterioration of the Eurozone crisis, the US fiscal cliff, or a\nChinese hard landing) hit trade and thus the economic prospects of emerging markets. In this case, we\nwould expect a 25% decline in earnings. More defensive Malaysia would do better, whereas more cyclical\nKorea and Taiwan would underperform. We assume, however, that the market would also be expecting\nsome recovery in earnings for 2013, helping the P/E multiple to recover to 9.5x trailing earnings.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nEmerging market\n\nInvestors are trying to figure out which emerging market central banks still have\nmonetary policy\n\nroom to ease monetary policy and where rates may be heading up.

Approximately $670,000 of the $7 million was\nfalsely recorded as “training” expenses.”\n\nLikewise, a New Jersey-based telecommunications\ncompany spent millions of dollars on approximately 315\ntrips for Chinese government officials, ostensibly to inspect\nfactories and train the officials in using the company’s\nequipment.” In reality, during many of these trips, the off-\ncials spent little or no time visiting the company’s facilities,\nbut instead visited tourist destinations such as Hawaii, Las\nVegas, the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, Disney World,\nUniversal Studios, and New York City.* Some of the trips\nwere characterized as “factory inspections” or “training”\nwith government customers but consisted primarily or\nentirely of sightseeing to locations chosen by the officials,\ntypically lasting two weeks and costing between $25,000\nand $55,000 per trip.

Clear\nguidelines and processes can be an effective and efficient\nmeans for controlling gift-giving, deterring improper\ngifts, and protecting corporate assets.\n\nThe FCPA does not prohibit gift-giving. Rather, just\nlike its domestic bribery counterparts, the FCPA prohibits\nthe payments of bribes, including those disguised as gifts.\n\nCharitable Contributions\n\nCompanies often engage in charitable giving as part\nof legitimate local outreach.
