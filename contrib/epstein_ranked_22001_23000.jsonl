Previously, we made the suggestion that\nthe US dollar is on the right side of the Dollar Smile against the majors, but\nit is on the left side of the Dollar Smile against the EM\n\ncurrencies. Reaganomics-Lite should be positive for the dollar, even if the\nUS’ twin deficits could widen. ‘America First’ means that there will be a\nbifurcation in economic prosperity, that economic strength in the US will no\nlonger translate, with the same elasticities as before, into prosperity in many\nparts of EM. (1) The dollar has begun a consolidation phase this week. But\nmy guess is that it will be temporary and shallow, partly because the data\n(ISM and NFPRs) will be sufficiently strong to justify another Fed rate hike\non December 14. The weekly claims data remain extraordinarily strong,\nwhile the second derivatives in the data in much of EM have ceased to be\npositive. (2) Further advances in the dollar, however, will of course depend\non the policy announcements and delivery by the Trump Administration, as\nwell as an apparent lack of an economic strategy in other countries. (3)\nYield differentials have helped the dollar advance vis-a-vis the JPY and the\nEUR. However, I should note that the EMU economies are not doing that\nbadly, though credit demand remains weak. PMI remains well above 50 and\ninflation has bounced away from zero. The main factor — other than yield\ndifferentials - weighing on the EUR 1s the risk that we will see more political\nuncertainty in Europe. (4) I came across an editorial arguing that Mr\nTrump’s protectionist policies would hurt the dollar’s international\nstanding. While this may be a popular view — that the US, as a savings\ndeficit nation, needs a globalised world to finance its external balance —I\ncontest this conclusion. I think it will be extremely difficult for the\ninternational status of the dollar to be supplanted, even with Mr Trump as\nthe President. The dollar losing its hegemonic status has been a popular\nthesis by many academics over the last twenty years — precisely the period\nwhen the dollar’s international and reserve currency status has risen. In\nmany ways, the sturdiness of the dollar’s global status has surprised some\npeople, because globalisation is supposed to lead to a multi-polar world\nwhere the US loses its dominance. That is certainly true for the real\neconomy, but exactly the opposite has happened for the dollar. This is a\npoint I’ve tried hard to make over the years, that financial globalisation is\nuni-polar, even though trade globalisation is multi-polar. Look at how the\nrise in the dollar is hurting, disproportionately, the high-yield and EM\ncurrencies. Further, which currencies might replace the dollar? The EUR\nitself is still in an existential crisis; nothing needs to be said about the JPY;\nChina could not even dare opening up its capital account. In fact, Beijing\nhas just issued even more ‘strict controls’ on overseas investment, after\nexperiencing some USD207 billion in outflows in Q3 2016.

This was not due to\nany inadequacy in their brains. On the contrary, even before the emergence of our\nanatomically modern human sub-species, they were making things like clothes and\ncampfires, using knowledge that was not in their genes. It was created in their brains by\nthinking, and preserved by individuals in each generation imitating their elders.\nMoreover, this must have been knowledge in the sense of understanding, because it is\nimpossible to imitate novel complex behaviors like those without understanding what the\ncomponent behaviors are for.”°\n\nSuch knowledgeable imitation depends on successfully guessing explanations,\nwhether verbal or not, of what the other person is trying to achieve and how each of his\nactions contributes to that—for instance, when he cuts a groove in some wood, gathers\ndry kindling to put in it, and so on.\n\nThe complex cultural knowledge that this form of imitation permitted must have\nbeen extraordinarily useful. It drove rapid evolution of anatomical changes, such as\nincreased memory capacity and more gracile (less robust) skeletons, appropriate to an\never more technology-dependent lifestyle. No nonhuman ape today has this ability to\nimitate novel complex behaviors. Nor does any present-day artificial intelligence. But\nour pre-sapiens ancestors did.\n\nAny ability based on guessing must include means of correcting one’s guesses,\nsince most guesses will be wrong at first. (There are always many more ways of being\nwrong than right.) Bayesian updating is inadequate, because it cannot generate novel\nguesses about the purpose of an action, only fine-tune—or, at best, choose among—\nexisting ones. Creativity is needed. As the philosopher Karl Popper explained, creative\ncriticism, interleaved with creative conjecture, is how humans learn one another’s\nbehaviors, including language, and extract meaning from one another’s utterances.”’\n\n6 “ Aping” (imitating certain behaviors without understanding) uses inborn hacks such as the mirror-neuron\nsystem. But behaviors imitated that way are drastically limited in complexity. See Richard Byrne,\n“Imitation as Behaviour Parsing,” Phil. Trans. R.

The message from China to US universities is clear: Do not transgress the\npolitical no-go zones of the Chinese Communist Party or government, or you will pay\na price. Sometimes the pressure is overt; other times it is more subtle and indirect, but\nno less alarming. Some American faculty members report troubling conversations with\nuniversity administrators who continue to view Chinese students as such a lucrative\nrevenue stream that it should not be endangered by “needlessly irritating Chinese\nauthorities.”\n\nCensorship and Self-Censorship\n\nThe final category of troubling Chinese influence on American campuses involves the\nvexing issue of self-censorship among faculty and students in Chinese studies.*° In a\nmuch-quoted essay, Perry Link described censorship within China as the use of vague\nthreats to induce academics, writers, and others to self-limit what they say; he called\nthis “the anaconda in the chandelier” syndrome.*! More recently, the phenomenon\n\nhas begun to loom over scholars working outside China, and the Chinese government\nhas started deploying a variety of techniques to also encourage self-censorship beyond\nChina’s borders, including in the United States. In some cases, this syndrome has led to\noutright self-censorship of academic work. To cite some of the most egregious examples:\n\ne Denial of visas to qualified scholars and students seeking access to China for\nresearch or training purposes. The State Department estimates that fifteen to\ntwenty individuals are on an outright “black list,” while scores of others appear\nto be on a “gray” list, where denials are less absolute and sometimes temporary\nor limited only to certain categories of visa.

(“I\nsuppose travel with Clinton changed the arc of my life,” Epstein tells me.\n“There were, I knew, lots of obvious reasons not to do it, but having the\nability to spend 100 hours with a former president just doesn’t happen to\nmany people.”)\n\nThe instinctively private Epstein is not just increasingly exposed, but\nclearly curious about the nature of exposure.\n\nI met Epstein around this time. Epstein had become a more and more\nactive backer of advanced scientific research and in 2002 he was taking a\nsmall group of scientists out to the TED conference in Monterey. The TED\norganizers invited various other TED participants, including me, to join the\nflight. A small group assembled at the private plane terminal, most of us\nunfamiliar with our benefactor, and as we headed in the direction of the\ndiscrete private plans we were gently pointed to our ride: Epstein’s 727.\n\nIt is some thoroughly updated drawing room set-up, all of us\nnervously ensconced in this luxury plane, waiting for our unknown host to\narrive—and soon he does, tanned, relaxed, with wide open smile,\naccompanied by three young women.\n\nIt would be unlikely, outside of a men’s magazine fantasy of the luxe\nlife, that you could locate this in reality. Epstein’s attentions, taking time\nwith each of his passengers, seemed impossible to account for. The quiet of\nthe plane, engineered into acoustic perfection, seemed spooky. Epstein’s\nthree companions were witty, poised, helpful as well as powerfully\nalluring—as though stewardesses of bygone times.\n\n(One more thing about this trip: Google founders, Larry Page and\nSergey Brin, with their company still in its infancy, came out to see the\nplane on the Monterey tarmac and, with a few other Googlers, literally ran\nwhopping from one end of the plan to the other. Then they described for\nEpstein, in what I can not now remember as a put on or entrepreneurial\nbrainstorm, a brand extension in which they would market a line of Google\nbras with the Os as convenient cups. In fact, the name Google, they said,\nwas invented out of the belief that men would focus on a word with two Os\nin it.)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022759\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Under\nChevron, where Congress has not\n“directly addressed the precise question\nat issue,”’ id. at 842-843, that\nrulemaking authority may be used in\norder “‘to fill any gap left, implicitly or\nexplicitly, by Congress.” Id. at 843.\n\nEven assuming that the absence of an\nexplicit posting requirement in the\nNLRA is not interpreted as clear\nexpression of Congressional intent, the\nmajority fails to persuade that Congress\ndelegated authority in Section 6 of the\nNLRA for the Board to fill a putative\nstatutory gap by promulgating a rule\nthat an employer commits an unfair\nlabor practice by failing to affirmative\nnotify its employees of their rights\nunder the NLRA. As the Supreme Court\nhas explained, ‘the ultimate question is\nwhether Congress would have intended,\nand expected, courts to treat [the\nregulation] as within, or outside, its\ndelegation to the agency of ‘gap-filling’\nauthority.” Long Island Care at Home,\nLtd. v. Coke, 551 U.S. 158, 173 (2007).\n\nThere is no doubt that there are many\ngaps and ambiguities in the NLRA that\nCongress intended for the Board to\naddress, using its labor expertise, either\nthrough adjudication or rulemaking.\nHowever, the existence of ambiguity in\na statute is not enough per se to warrant\ndeference to the agency’s interpretation\nof its authority in every respect. The\nambiguity must be such as to make it\nappear that Congress either explicitly or\nimplicitly delegated authority to cure\nthat ambiguity. Am. Bar Ass’n v. FTC,\n430 F.3d 457, 469 (D.C. Cir. 2005);\nMotion Picture Ass’n of America, Inc. v.\nFCC, 309 F. 3d 796, 801 (D.C. Cir. 2002)\n(“MPAA ’’) (“agency’s interpretation of\n[a] statute is not entitled to deference\nabsent a delegation of authority from\nCongress to regulate in the areas at\nissue.”’).\n\nThus, even when an administrative\nagency seeks to address what it believes\nis a serious interpretive problem, the\nSupreme Court has said that the agency\n“may not exercise its authority ‘in a\nmanner that is inconsistent with the\nadministrative structure that Congress\nenacted into law.’’’ FDA v. Brown &\nWilliamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S.\n120, 125(2000) (quoting ETSI Pipeline\nProject v. Missouri, 484 U.S. 495,\n517(1988)). Further, the statute at issue\nmust be considered as a “symmetrical\nand coherent regulatory scheme.”’\nGustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561,\n569, 115 S.Ct. 1061, 131 L.Ed.2d 1\n(1995). In our case, the exercise of\nrulemaking authority under Section 6 is\nnot self-effectuating; it must be shown\n\nto relate reasonably to some other\nprovision as part of the overall statutory\nscheme contemplated by Congress.175\n\nNothing in the text or the regulatory\nstructure of the NLRA suggests that the\nBoard has the authority to promulgate\nthe notice-posting rule at issue in order\nto address a gap in the statutory scheme\nfor resolving questions concerning\nrepresentation through Section 9, or in\npreventing, through Sections 8 and 10,\nspecifically enumerated unfair labor\npractices that adversely affect\nemployees’ Section 7 rights. On the\ncontrary, it is well-established that the\nBoard lacks independent authority to\ninitiate or to solicit the initiation of\nrepresentation and unfair labor practice\nproceedings, and Section 10(a) limits\nthe Board’s powers to preventing only\nthe unfair labor practices listed in\nSection 8 of the Act. Yet the majority\nasserts that it may exceed these\nlimitations by requiring employers to\npost a notice of employee rights and\nillustrative unfair labor practices at all\ntimes, regardless of whether a petition\nhad been filed or an employer has been\nfound to have committed an unfair labor\npractice.\n\nThe majority’s reliance on a\ncombination of Section 7, 8, and 10\nwarrants special mention. They reason\nthat an employer interferes with Section\n7 rights in general, and thereby violates\nSection 8(a)(1), by failing to give\ncontinuous notice to employees of those\nrights. It may be a truism that an\nemployee must be aware of his rights in\norder to exercise them, but it does not\nfollow that it is the employer under our\nstatutory scheme who must provide\nenlightenment or else incur liability for\nviolating those rights. The new unfair\nlabor practice created by the rule bears\nno reasonable relation to any unfair\nlabor practice in the NLRA’s pre-\nexisting enforcement scheme developed\nover seven decades.!77 It certainly bears\n\n176 See, e.g., Mourning v. Family Publications\nService, Inc., 411 U.S. 356, (1973) Unlike here, the\nFederal Reserve Board easily met this standard in\nMourning when issuing a disclosure regulation\nunder the Truth in Lending Act, even though that\nAct did not explicitly require lenders to make such\ndisclosures. In sustaining the regulation, the Court\nound the regulation to be within the Federal\nReserve’s rulemaking authority and, in light of the\negislative history, the disclosure requirement was\nnot contrary to the statute. ‘The crucial distinction,\n* * * [was that] the disclosure requirement was in\nact enforced through the statute’s pre-existing\nremedial scheme and in a manner consistent with\nit.” Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535\nU.S. 81, 94 (2002).\n\n177 The Senate report on the Wagner bill stressed\nthat unfair labor practices were “‘strictly limited to\nthose enumerated in section 8. This is made clear\nby paragraph 8 of section 2, which provides that\n‘The term ‘unfair labor practice’ means unfair labor\npractice listed in Section 8,” and by Section 10(a)\nempowering the Board to prevent any unfair labor\n\nno relation to the few examples the\nmajority can muster in Board precedent.\nThe only instance with even a passing\nresemblance to the rights notice-posting\nrequirement here is the requirement that\na union give notice of Beck 178 and\nGeneral Motors 17° rights. However, the\nfailure to give such a notice is not per\nse unlawful. It becomes an unfair labor\npractice only when a union, without\ngiving notice, takes the affirmative\naction of seeking to obligate an\nemployee to pay fees and dues under a\nunion-security clause.18° Beyond that, a\nunion has no general obligation to give\nemployees notice of their Beck and\nGeneral Motors rights; much less does it\nviolate the NLRA by failing to do so. By\ncontrast, the rule promulgated today\nimposes a continuing obligation on\nemployers to post notice of employees’\ngeneral rights and, even absent any\naffirmative act involving those rights,\nmakes the failure to maintain such\nnotice unlawful.181\n\nUnlike my colleagues, I find that the\nSupreme Court’s opinion in Local 357,\nTeamsters v. NLRB, 365 U.S. 667 (1961),\nspeaks directly to this point. In that\ncase, the Board found a hiring hall\nagreement unlawfully discriminatory\nper se because, even though it included\nan express anti-discrimination\n\npractice “listed in Section 8.” Thus, “[nJeither the\nNational Labor Relations Board nor the courts are\ngiven any blanket authority to prohibit whatever\nlabor practices that in their judgment are deemed\nto be unfair.” S. Rep. No. 573, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.\n17 (1935) at 8-9 reprinted in Legislative History of\nthe National Labor Relations Act of 1935, Vol. Hat\n2307-2308 (1985).\n\n178 Communications Workers v. Beck, 487 U.S.\n735 (1988).\n\n179 NLRB v.

In CogPrime they are used as inspiration for slightly different, artificial\neconomics based computational algorithms; but their hypothesized relevance to brain function\nis nevertheless of interest in a CogPrime context, as it gives some hints about the potential\nconnection between low-level neural net mechanics and higher-level cognitive dynamics.\n\nHopfield nets lead naturally to a hypothesis about neural knowledge representation, which\nholds that a distinct mental concept is represented in the brain as either:\n\n1. a set of “cell assemblies”, where each assembly is a network of neurons that are interlinked\nin such a way as to fire in a (perhaps nonlinearly) synchronized manner\n\n2. adistinct temporal activation pattern, which may occur in any one (or more) of a particular\nset of cell assemblies\n\nFor instance, this hypothesis is perfectly coherent if one interprets a “mental concept” as a\nSMEPH (defined in Chapter 14) ConceptNode, i.e. a fuzzy set of perceptual stimuli to which\nthe organism systematically reacts in different ways. Also, although we will focus mainly on\ndeclarative knowledge here, we note that the same basic representational ideas can be applied\nto procedural and episodic knowledge: these may be hypothesized to correspond to temporal\nactivation patterns as characterized above.\n\nIn the biology literature, perhaps the best-articulated modern theories championing the cell\nassembly view are those of Gunther Palm [Pal&82, HAGO7] and Susan Greenfield [SF05, CSGO7].\nPalm focuses on the dynamics of the formation and interaction assemblies of cortical columns.\nGreenfield argues that each concept has a core cell assembly, and that when the concept rises\nto the focus of attention, it recruits a number of other neurons beyond its core characteristic\nassembly into a “transient ensemble.”!\n\nIt’s worth noting that there may be multiple redundant assemblies representing the same\nconcept — and potentially recruiting similar transient assemblies when highly activated. The\nimportance of repeated, slightly varied copies of the same subnetwork has been emphasized by\nEdelman [Ede93] among other neural theorists.\n\n1 The larger an ensemble is, she suggests, the more vivid it is as a conscious experience; an hypothesis that\naccords well with the hypothesis made in [Goe06b] that a more informationally intense pattern corresponds to\na more intensely conscious quale — but we don’t need to digress extensively onto matters of consciousness for\nthe present purposes.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013173\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It triggers its pursuit function,\nwhich consists of the simplest possible rules. First, move in a random direction. If the\nscent increases, continue moving in that direction. If the scent decreases, move in the\nopposite direction. If the scent is lost, move sideways until a scent is picked up again.\nRepeat until contact with the target is achieved.\n\nThe plume of my scent is densest next to me and disperses as it spreads, an\ninvisible fog of particles exuded from my skin that moves like smoke with the wind. The\ncloser to my skin, the higher the particle density; the farther away, the lower. This\ndecrease 1s called a gradient, which describes any gradual transition from one level to\nanother one—as opposed to a “step function,” which describes a discrete change.\n\nOnce the mosquito follows this gradient to its source using its simple algorithm, it\nlands on my skin, which it senses with the heat detectors in its feet, which are attuned to\nanother gradient—temperature. It then pushes its needle-shaped proboscis through the\nsurface, where a third set of sensors in the tip detect yet another gradient, that of blood\ndensity. This flexible needle wriggles around under my skin until the scent of blood\nsteers it to a capillary, which it punctures. Then my blood begins to flow into the\nmosquito. Mission accomplished. Ouch.\n\nWhat seems like the powerful radar of insects in the dark, with blood-seeking\nintelligence inexplicable for such tiny brains, is actually just a sensitive nose with almost\nno intelligence at all. Mosquitoes are closer to plants that follow the sun than to guided\nmissiles. Yet by applying this simple “follow your nose” rule quite literally, they can\ntravel through a house to find you, slip through cracks in a screen door, even zero in on\nthe tiny strip of skin you left exposed between hat and shirt collar. It’s just a random\nwalk, combined with flexible wings and legs that let the insect bounce off obstacles, and\nan instinct to descend a chemical gradient.\n\nBut “gradient descent” is much more than bug navigation.

Water flows along a gravity gradient downhill, and your body lives\non chemical solutions flowing across cell membranes from high concentration to\n\nlow. Every action in the universe 1s driven by some gradient drive, from the movement\nof the planets around gravity gradients to the joining of atoms along electric-charge\ngradients to form molecules. Our own urges, such as hunger and sleepiness, are driven\nby electro-chemical gradients in our bodies. And our brain’s functions, the electrical\nsignals moving along ion channels in the synapses between our neurons, are simply\natoms and electrons flowing “downhill” along yet more electrical and chemical gradients.\n\n104\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016324\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

When the House and Senate Intelligence ©\nCommittees asked the NSA how many documents Snowden took,\nthe NSA could not come up with a definitive number despite having\nemployed a world-class team of experts to reconstruct the crime.

Ping An & CICC are the 2 H shares that operate in the middle of Alibaba, Tencent, Lufax. \nA. The chart below represents a deep dive we did on the new world of Chinese banking. Companies \nlike Zhong An, WeBank and Lufax will grow dramatically and will take advantage of (as well as \nsupport) the massive worlds of Alibaba and Tencent. Together, Alibaba and Tencent have market cap \nof $500 bn. Popping up in many of these areas of overlap are Ping An and CICC. They are \nstrategically placed to make great strides in China. This is slowly being recognized in the case of Ping \nAN (See Page 8 of attached PPT). Ping An's market cap is $97 bn. It is connected to Zhong An.. It \nowns 44% of Lufax. And some if its management were the very ones that started WeBank. It is \nperfectly positioned for the coming boom in new banking. It has the best combined ROA and ROE \nglobally and its P/E of 10x is trading on a 50% discount to the global averages. Why is Ping An \ntrading at a discount to AIA? BUY PING AN -- SELL AIA.. \nB. The other company which has the best return on capital of any broker dealer -- and is also  \npositioned nicely for the coming boom in the new era of banking in China -- is CICC. CICC and CDH \n(a CICC breakaway) both invested in Zhong An and Lufax. CICC has vision and a proven track record. \nYet it has been a laggard. This is a top pick for H shares for China in 2017. The other bank with great \nvision in this area is CCB, which has invested in Ant Financial. BUY H shares CCB and CICC. (See \nattached PPT for portfolios and China fintech details). \nC. IPOs in 2017. I think Zhong An will be a surprise for 2017 in the Hong Kong market. Its market \ncap is expected to be $10 bn and it has interesting potential in so many areas of insurance. It \nremains an insurance company whose marginal cost of a new customer is zero. It has a talented \nteam of 900 engineers and has new Al and blockchain divisions. It is rolling out an impressive array \nof products including corporate solutions for insurance and investment plans. Lufax CEO Greg Gibb \nmade a big splash at the Finnovasia (Schulte Research co-sponsored it) in Hong Kong last month. \nThe company is a diversified financial conglomerate akin to \"Schwab meets etrade and Fidelity\" --\nonly 25 years ago. It needs an IPO north of $25 bn in order for the private equity partners to make \nmoney. Lastly, Ant Financial will come to the market for a $60 bn IPO in 2017 -- also in Hong Kong. \nThis is a mothership company that goes to the heart of China's system. Its early investors are CIC, \nCDB, CCB, China Life and other vital organs of the system. It will not be allowed to fail. There are \nsome questions about whether to own this through Alibaba, since Alibaba will own 33% of Ant post \nIPO. I'm in this camp. Buy Alibaba on this pullback. (See attached PPT for the full China Fintech \nReport). \n2. Koch Industries saturates both the offices of Trump as well as Pence. Mega bullish for Russia, oil \nand gas companies. Mega bearish for alternative energy. \nA. The Koch Brothers are not just two grumpy men -- they are a political party. Koch Industries is the \nsecond biggest private company in the US after Cargill. They operate public and secretive political \nentities in 32 states and dole out more than $500 million each political cycle to various entities in the \nstrongest places. The political entities employ more than 1,200 people and the amount of donations \navailable to right wing causes varies dramatically but is as high as $750 million per cycle. It is the \nthird largest party in the US after the Democratic and Republican party. It controls the Libre Alliance, \nAmericans for Prosperity, Freedom Partners, Institute for Energy Research, American Energy Alliance \nand Concerned Veterans. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026043 \nB. What do they do with their money? They support right wing Republican candidates for all \norganizations -- attorneys general, Senate, House and state political figures. This is where it gets \ninteresting. Freedom Partners is thought of as the \"Koch bank\". Guess who ran this? Marc Short. It \ncontrols about $250 mn in funds for political activity. Guess who employed Marc Short as chief of \nstaff? Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Guess who then employed him as chief of staff? President-elect \nTrump. Matt Lloyd is in charge of communications and strategy for VP-elect Pence -- he came from \nKoch Industries. Governor Pence was a frequent attendee of the secretive semi-annual meetings of \nthe Koch Brothers. Guess who raised more than $100 million for Freedom Partners? Don McGahn. \nGuess who is the new White House Counsel for President-elect Trump? Don McGahn. (McGahn was \nembroiled in the Tom Delay scandal in the 2000s). Guess who had two companies which had Koch \nBrothers as investors and whose chief of staff (Chenowith) came from the Koch world? The new CIA-\ndesignate chief Mike Pompeo. (Pompeo's Kansas campaign received a $900,000 donation from Koch). \nGuess who gave $1 mn to Americans for Prosperity? Education secretary designate Betsy Devos. \nGuess who has written the strategy paper for the Department of Energy transition? Tom Pyle -- He is \naffiliated with the Koch Industries Office of federal Affairs and the Institute for Energy Research. \nGuess who was caught up in a Koch Industries scandal for a petrochemical port project (with a Koch \naffiliated Messr. Henneberry)? Governor Nikki Haley who is UN Ambassador designate. \nC. Advisors are ALL Koch-related. Here is where it gets fun. Former campaign advisor Corey \nLewandowski came from KochLand. Rebekah Mercer is part of Koch and and gave $2.5 mn to \nFreedom Partners. Kellyanne Conway has connections to Pence from way back and is connected to \nSteve Bannon through the Center for National Policy. Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie \ncame from Citizens United. The Director of Coalitions for Trump is named Alan Cobb -- he came from \nAmericans for Prosperity. Daren Se!nick is a transition advisor and he came from Concerned \nVeterans. Others on the Trump team who came from Kochland include Stuart Jolly, Eli Miller, Scott \nHagerstrom and Matt Ciepielowski. \n3. BUY the hell out of Russia -- Exxon Rex is a cabinet trifecta for Koch Brothers. \nA. And there's Exxon Rex. Any contribution from Exxon received money from Koch -- and vice versa. \nRex Tillerson is worth $151 million and is leaving Exxon next year. He seems to have accepted \nsecretary of state position. He inked a deal worth $300 billion in oil and gas exploration in 2012. (For \nthat, he received the highest civilian honour bestowed by Russia). This will be a boom for Koch \nIndustries as the sanctions against Russia are lifted. (Thank you Uncle Vlad for interfering in the \nelections). This will be a boom for Russia -- for equities, FX and bonds. It is clear that sanctions \nagainst Russia will be lifted regardless of whether Russia interfered in the elections. (Clinton made \nthis a campaign issue and still lost!). \nB. Anyone who thinks this will be reversed by Greenpeace or other green organization is kidding  \nthemselves. The Senate and House is Republican. Majority parties control all committees so they \ncontrol the agenda. The agenda is set. These guys are geniuses with the news cycle. And the vast \narray of think tanks controlled by the Koch Brothers (most of them) allows them to control the news \ncycle as well as the opinion pages of newspapers. The web on control on public opinion from the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026044 \nKoch Brothers reaches every newspaper through a large array of think tanks like the AEI and Cato \nInstitute, not to mention the vast array of Koch think tanks. \nC. If you don't like this, tough luck. Life is not fair. This is not going to be reversed. Think of it as \nwatching a science experiment. Bush lost the popular vote to Gore in 2001 and completely reversed \npolicies on tax, environment, Middle East, energy, fracking, birth control, and LGBT issues. Trump, \nPence, Bannon and Koch will make a deal which will be a hybrid of religious right on moral issues and \n\"zero intrusion from government\" in commerce. Republicans already control the Senate, the House, a \nmajority of governorships as well as a majority of attorneys general. It will be very hard to reverse \nthis. And if Trump can deliver jobs to the midwest red states, more senate seats will turn red. Tom \nPyle's list of things to for the Department of Energy's transition team is expressly designed to do this. \nThis includes new oil and gas leasing projects, more fracking, more coal, more LNG projects -- and a \ngreen light for both the Keystone and Dakota pipelines. The working paper reneges on the Paris pact, \nthe Clean Power Plan and the carbon tax. And it is expressly a climate change denial policy. States \nlike North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Iowa, Texas, Louisiana, West Virginia, Kansas and \nothers will come to life again.. Most of these states have small populations but each gets a governor \nand two senators. \nThis report is published and distributed by IND-X Advisors Limited (\"IND-X\").

The mechanism is fairly simple: dirt is obtained from wherever it can be found to \ndiscredit an opponent. It is then \"leaked,\" usually either anonymously or on background, to targeted \nmedia channels. What makes the 2016 campaign particularly interesting from a counterintelligence \nperspective is not that both sides had their own disclosure operations, but that both sides were \noffered the dirt for them by a common source: Russian intelligence. \nAs we now know from the emails of Donald Trump Jr., a thinly veiled intermediary, Natalya \nVeselnitskaya, offered the Trump campaign documents that putatively would show that Hillary \nClinton had received illegal donations from Russian financiers; in the event, no such documents \nwere proffered. But it is a reasonable assumption that Veselnitskaya could not have made such an \noffer, especially in a meeting attended by three other Russians, unless the move was approved by \nthe FSB, the Russian security service. \nA second disclosure operation, this one involving supporters of the Clinton campaign, was more \nlayered. The proximate intermediary was Fusion GPS, a research firm used by the law firm Baker \nHostetler, and the secondary \"cut-out\" was the British firm Orbis, co-founded by former MI-6 \nofficer Christopher Steele. We know something about this sub-contractor from the depositions \nSteele gave in defending a libel suit in London. According to Steele, Fusion GPS not only had him \nprepare the so-called \"dossier\" on Trump but also directed Steele to \"leak\" it to specified reporters \nat Mother Jones, Yahoo, the New York Times, the Washington Post, The New Yorker, and CNN. In \nsome cases, Steele was directed to brief the selected journalists personally. The dirt in these \"leaks\" \nrelied heavily on information supplied by two Russian government sources: Source A, whom Steele \ncalls \"a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure\"; and Source B, \"a former top-level intelligence \nofficer still active in the Kremlin.\" Sources A and B provided information supposedly exposing a \nlong-time Russian FSB operation to get compromising information that could be used to control \nTrump. The idea that two Russian intelligence sources would reveal a long-time Kremlin-backed \nFSB operation bears further examination. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025548 \nMichael More11, a former acting CIA director, casts light on the sourcing of the dirt in the Steele \ndossier. \"I had two questions when I first read [the dossier],\" More11 said in an NBC interview. \n\"One was, how did Chris [Steele] talk to these sources? I have subsequently learned that he used \nintermediaries. I asked myself, why did these guys provide this information, what was their \nmotivation? And I subsequently learned that he paid them. That the intermediaries paid the sources \nand the intermediaries got the money from Chris.\" \nPaying ex-FSB officers for sensitive information? As Steele is no doubt aware, there is no such \nthing as an ex-FSB officer. All Russian intelligence officers, whether currently or formerly \nemployed, if in Russia, operate under the same tough security regime. The selling of secret \ninformation by them is espionage, pure and simple. Selling it to someone connected to an adversary \nintelligence service greatly compounds the crime. Sources A and B (through their intermediaries) \nknew that they were dealing with an ex-MI-6 man who could use their betrayal of secrets against \nthem. The only safe way for A and B to provide the requested dirt would be to clear it with the \nsecurity regime at the FSB. This precaution, a required step in such exchanges, would mean that the \ndirt in the dossier, whether true or false, was curated by the FSB and spoon-fed to Steele. If so, the \nFSB was the surreptitious provider of this part of the Steele dossier. \nThe third disclosure operation involved stolen emails from the DNC bearing on the unfair treatment \nby Democratic Party officials of Bernie Sanders, which were posted on the DC Leaks website. \nPresident Obama identified the Kremlin as the author of this operation, saying \"These data theft \nand disclosure activities could only have been directed by the highest levels of the Russian \ngovernment.\" If so, as in the previous cases, the FSB would have curated the dirt. To be sure, oppo-\nresearch operatives, because of their singular focus on getting usable slime, are highly vulnerable to \nshady offers, but why would Russia so blatantly feed the slime to all sides in a campaign? \nThe United States has a wide array of tools for monitoring Russian intelligence, including the \nworld's most sophisticated sensors for intercepting signals, but discovering the Kremlin's motives \nremains an elusive enterprise because, unlike in a scientific inquiry, one cannot fully trust the \nobservable data. While a scientist can safely assume that the microbes he observes through the lens \nof a microscope are not employing guile to mislead him, an intelligence analyst cannot make \nsimilar assumptions about the content of intercepted communications from Russia. If one assumes \nthat the Russians do not know that the channel is being monitored—an assumption which, \nfollowing the defection of Edward Snowden to Russia, is hard to make prudently—then the \nintelligence gleaned from that channel can reveal the Kremlin's activities and motive. If, however, \nit is understood that the Russians know that a channel is being monitored, the information conveyed \nover it can be considered a disclosure operation. \nIf, for example, a Mafia family finds out that the FBI is tapping its telephone lines, it can use those \nlines to burn its rivals. The Kremlin can also use a knowntapped phone line to its advantage. \nConsider, for example, the tapped phone of Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. On December 1, \n2016, Kislyak went to Trump Tower to meet Jared Kushner and Michael Flynn. According to \nKushner's version of that meeting, Kislyak suggested that Russian generals could supply \ninformation about Russian military operations in Syria on the condition that the Trump transition \nteam provide a \"secure line in the transition office.\" Of course, as Kislyak likely knew, transition \nteams don't have secure lines to Moscow. Kushner responded by asking if the Russian embassy \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025549 \ncould supply such a \"secure line.\" Kislyak then used an open phone line at his embassy to relay \nKushner's response to his foreign ministry in Moscow. It is inconceivable that Kislyak did not \nknow that the call would be monitored by the FBI, since the FBI had routinely listened in on these \nlines for the past 68 years, or that his discussion of Kushner's request would set off alarm bells in \nthe intelligence community. \nIf Kislyak had wanted to hide this exchange from U.S. intelligence, he could have easily sent it \nunder diplomatic cover directly to Moscow, used a secure line, or relayed it in a coded fashion. By \ncommunicating the message en clair, or in plaintext, Kislyak skillfully exposed Kushner's \nincredibly stupid response, which he himself had provoked, to stoke distrust about the incoming \npresident within the U.S. intelligence community. Nor was this the only mistrust Kislyak \ncultivated: the conversations on the monitored phone led to the firing of National Security Advisor \nMichael Flynn, and conversations that Kislyak had with Attorney General Jeff Sessions led to \nSessions's recusing himself from the Russian investigation, which has now driven a wedge between \nPresident Trump and one of his most effective and popular cabinet members. \nKislyak's resume indicates that he is a well-regarded and competent player in the game of nations: \nhe has served as Second Secretary of the Soviet UN mission in New York, First Secretary of the \nSoviet Embassy in Washington, Deputy Director of the Soviet Department of International \nOrganizations in Moscow, Permanent Russian representative to NATO in Brussels, Deputy Foreign \nMinister, and Ambassador to the United States. Nothing in his 37-year career, either during or after \nthe Cold War, suggests that his moves are not aligned with Kremlin strategy. \nBut when it comes to the various disclosures and interventions surrounding the 2016 election, what \nexactly was that strategy? \nIn a report issued on January 6, 2017, entitled \"Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in \nRecent U.S. Elections,\" the U.S. intelligence community concluded, based both on its sources and \nits analysis of stories on the Russian-controlled network RT, that Putin wanted to hurt Clinton, help \nTrump, and discredit the American election. These may well have been motives of the Russian \npresident, but the narrowly focused assessment fails to explain, or even take into account, Kislyak's \npost-election ensnarement of Kushner, or the discrediting dirt against Trump. If Putin had really \nwanted to help Trump win the election, why did Russian sources provide damaging dirt to Steele, \nwhich could have cost Trump the election? Why did Kislyak provide the FBI with information, via \na known tapped line, that could (and did) compromise key members of Trump's administration? \nA wider focus can be found, of all places, in Oliver Stone's revealing, if fawning, four-hour \ninterview with Putin, in which the Russian dictator makes clear that he views American hegemony, \nincluding America's standing and respect in the international community, as a threat that Russia \nmust counter. One way to undermine America's standing is to provide disclosures that can be used \nby its own political factions, and the media, to sow distrust in America's reliability as a democracy \nfounded on transparency. Putin tells the truth when he says that it doesn't matter particularly to \nRussia whether Clinton or Trump won the election: his goal was to install doubt in the legitimacy \nof the process, regardless of how it turned out. \nEdward Jay Epstein's most recent book is How America Lost Its Secrets: Edward \nSnowden, the Man and the Theft, published by Alfred A.

Why would Appelbaum keep\nit secret for more than four months? The same pressure to publish\nwould also apply to the journalists Snowden had dealt with in Hong\nKong. If Snowden had given Poitras, Greenwald, Lam, or MacAskill\nthe Merkel document, or even told them about it in their interviews\nwith him in Hong Kong, The Guardian would have certainly rushed\nout such a scoop.\n\nAccording to a source with knowledge of the Snowden investiga-\ntion, there was no document referencing any spying on Merkel’s\nphone among the fifty-eight thousand documents on the thumb\ndrive that Snowden had given to Poitras and Greenwald in Hong\nKong. That absence would explain why Poitras had to send a text to\nSnowden in Moscow to ask for an explanation after the story broke.\n\nFurther confirmation of the absence of this document in the\nmaterial Snowden provided journalists in Hong Kong comes from\nJames Bamford, a well-respected expert on the NSA. In the course\nof researching his 2014 article on Snowden for Wired, he was given\naccess to all the documents Snowden gave to Poitras, Greenwald, and\n\n© Gellman. Bamford used a sophisticated indexing program to search ©\nthrough the database specifically for the Merkel material. He did not\nfind any. He reported that no document given to journalists in Hong\nKong even mentioned Merkel. It therefore appeared that the Merkel\ndocument was provided to Der Spiegel after Snowden went to Mos-\ncow. If so, some party had access to NSA documents after Snowden\narrived in Russia and provided the Der Spiegel authors with the\nscoop. In that context, it might not have been a pure coincidence that\nKucherena disclosed that Snowden had access to documents that he\nhad not given to journalists in Hong Kong shortly before just such a\ndocument was published in Germany.\n\nBamford explored the possibility that there might be another per-\nson in the NSA who was stealing documents. He wrote to Poitras\nand asked her whether the Merkel document could have come from\nanother person in the NSA. She declined, via a letter from her lawyer,\nto answer that question. But because she had not been the author of\nthe Der Spiegel article, and had not been given the document, there\nis no reason to believe that she would know its provenance.\n\nDocuments continued to emerge years after Snowden arrived in\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 182 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019670\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Partnering with TIIC and BRIDGE has enabled Edmond de Rothschild to build a strong franchise \nwithin infrastructure investments, complementing its overall Private Equity offering. Edmond de Rothschild \nhas also acted as anchor investor for these funds, demonstrating its strong alignment of interest with these \ninvestment teams. With Ariane we strongly believe that we should absolutely find a way to collaborate \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026069 \ntogether with you to think and initiate something to serve the future needs of the US in the infrastructure \nfield. \nPlease find attached further information on each manager. This would also be a chance for us to explore \nopportunities of working together in the future. \nPlease feel free to reach out to us if you require any further information. We look forward to hearing from \nyou soon. \nTIIC \nTIIC Group backed by Edmond de Rothschild, is a pan-European infrastructure firm advising on mid-market \ninfrastructure projects across Europe in both the transportation and social sectors. It was established in \n2008 by the 3 founding partners of TIIC Group, Jaime d'Almeida, Manuel Cary and Francisco Mendes, with \nstrategic support from the Edmond de Rothschild Group and Brisa. \nThe aim of TIIC Group is to bring an operational approach to infrastructure investments in Europe, drawing \nupon the extensive management and financial skills of its team members. These skills have been developed \nover many years at some of Europe's leading infrastructure operators and project financing firms which, \nwhen combined with the very specific infrastructure expertise of both the Edmond de Rothschild Group and \nBrisa, makes for a powerful and differentiated investment platform. \nTIIC Group operates from two offices in Lisbon and Paris, providing its team with access to relevant \ninvestment opportunities across key target markets in Europe as well as to leading industrial contractors, \noperators, advisors and financiers in the infrastructure industry. \nTIIC Group successfully raised a First Fund with €140m of commitments targeting transportation \ninvestments across Europe. The portfolio of the First Fund comprises 6 assets located in Portugal, Spain, \nFrance and Poland. They represent a carefully balanced mix of greenfield and early stage brownfield projects \nin roads and car parks. TIIC Group has played an active role in the sourcing and development of all \ninvestments and has made a significant contribution to value creation. TIIC Group believes that this is a high \nquality, operationally secure, cash yielding portfolio of assets which will be of strong interest to potential \ninvestors over the coming few years. \nTIIC has launched a successor fund, TIIC 2, which will build upon TIIC Group' differentiated approach to \ninfrastructure in Europe. TIIC 2 will is targeting aggregate commitments from investors of €300m (€350m \nhard cap) to invest into both transportation and social infrastructure projects in Europe. TIIC 2 will also seek \nto invest, on a very selective basis, into greenfield social infrastructure projects in New Frontier Markets, \nwithin close proximity to the European Union. Given its powerful network of relationships across Europe and \nthe operational skills of its team, TIIC Group will continue to target superior investment returns for TIIC 2's \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026070 \nportfolio of assets. These returns should be in line with the anticipated returns from the First Fund portfolio \nwhich is forecast to deliver a gross IRR of up to 14% and a multiple of approximately 2x on invested capital. \nTIIC announced the first close of TIIC 2 on December 30th 2016, with aggregate commitments of €135m from \na group of high quality and well-diversified limited partners. First close investors in TIIC 2 include the \nEuropean Investment Bank and Edmond de Rothschild, both with significant commitments, as well as the \nTIIC team. TIIC 2 is also supported by a number of existing investors, together with several European \ninsurance companies, pension funds and family offices. A second close is planned in the coming months and \nthe final close will occur before the end of 2017. We have received significant interest from a number of \nEuropean institutional investors, many of which are in the process of completing detailed due diligence on \nTIIC 2. We are firmly on track to achieve a final close of TIIC 2 before the end of the year. \nFurthermore, TIIC has announced the first exit from Fund 1, with outstanding returns. Three other \ninvestments are in sales processes and should close during the next few months. \nBRIDGE \nBRIDGE is an infrastructure debt platform initiated by Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (EdRAM) to \nenable institutional investors to access infrastructure assets with secured and stable revenue streams. BRIDGE \nis a London based second generation debt fund sourcing and structuring transactions directly from sponsors \nwhen feasible and one of the few independent debt teams only investing on behalf of clients. The BRIDGE \nteam has the ability to execute and deliver transactions as efficiently as traditional lenders as well as negotiate \nterms and conditions bringing optimised yield and security to investors. \nThe BRIDGE platform was set up as a new leg of EDR's Infrastructure, Real Assets & Structured Finance Team \nstriving to take advantage of the expertise of the infrastructure sector acquired when the team became a \nglobal leader in PPP & Transport infrastructure financial advisory in 2011 and 2012. \nThe BRIDGE platform raised € 400m of new monies in 2016 and has successfully reached the €1bn mark of \nAssets under Management at the end of 2016. The platform comprises three investment vehicles (French FCT \nand Lux SIF) and is currently fundraising for additional pockets of liquidity: \no BRIDGE I reached final closing in December 2014 with approximately €600m of aggregate commitments from a club \nof institutional investors. \no BRIDGE I Dedicated Compartmentis a vehicle created by a large European institution and anchor investor of the first \nfund with a €250m target amount available for deployment. \no BRIDGE II reached first close in December 2016 with €150m of commitments in order to invest in three transactions. \nFundraising for BRIDGE ll is still ongoing, targeting a group of institutional investors in Europe and elsewhere, with final \ntarget size of €600m. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026071 \nThe BRIDGE platform has a long-term European investment strategy and a mandate to cover all sectors of \ninfrastructure, notably energy, renewables, utilities, transportation, telecommunications and social \ninfrastructure and can execute project financing, refinancing and acquisition finance transactions. \nThe BRIDGE platform currently comprises investments of between €20420 million each, in 17 European \ninfrastructure transactions. In 2016 alone, the BRIDGE team has achieved financial close for 11 infrastructure \ndeals in Europe aggregating ca. €390m. When benchmarked against other similar funds, the investment team \nhas succeeded in deploying faster and with credit spreads well above the infrastructure senior debt \nbenchmark, enabling BRIDGE to become a force in the growing institutions-backed infrastructure debt market. \nBRIDGE's ability to invest beyond the traditional definition of core infrastructure and to structure transactions \nwas a key differentiator when Edmond de Rothschild launched this platform, as part of its commitment to real \neconomy. BRIDGE is innovative in the sense that the investment team sources transactions directly from \nsponsors and is actively involved in the structuring phase, acting as Mandated Lead Arranger. \nBRIDGE comprises a large, international and skilled London based investment team of 11 investment \nprofessionals who between them have arranged more than €100bn of landmark infrastructure deals over the \nlast 20 years across the globe. The BRIDGE team is among the largest within the debt funds universe and \ndemonstrates the Edmond de Rothschild Group's commitment to the platform. \nKind regards, \nJohnny \nJohnny el HACHEM \nEdmond de Rothschild Private Equity \n29 Route de Pre-Bois \nCase postale 490 \n1215 Geneve 15 \nSuisse \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026072 \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

Yitzhak had said no at the time,\nbecause he was worried it would be seen as a de facto border and undermine the\nidea of building coexistence. My view then, and even more so now, was that we\nwould never get to the point of negotiating a final peace with the Palestinians\nunless we could stop at least most of the terror attacks before they happened. Peres,\ntoo, had been worried about “undermining coexistence.” But now, he and the rest\nof the cabinet were so shaken by the carnage Hamas had left that they approved the\nidea of a security barrier.\n\nAt our kirya meeting, hours after the latest bomb had exploded less than a mile\naway, Peres recognized we had to go further. Under Oslo, we had begun giving the\nPalestinians control over internal security in Gaza and parts of the West Bank.\nSince the new Hamas attacks, Arafat had been saying the right things. After the\nfirst bomb in Jerusalem, he’d phoned Shimon to offer condolences, telling\nreporters afterward that this was “a terrorist operation. I condemn it completely. It\nis not only against civilians, but against the whole peace process.” Yet when it\ncame to action, we saw no sign that he was willing, ready, or perhaps able to crack\ndown on the Islamist terror attacks. So Peres now announced that, if necessary in\norder to detain known terrorists, we would for the first time send Israeli troops\nback into areas where control had been handed back. If Arafat didn’t act, we\nwould.\n\nOn the political front, Peres did get some good news: President Clinton, anxious\nto preserve the progress he’d worked so closely with Yitzhak to achieve, organized\nan unprecedented show of international condemnation of the terror attacks. With\nEgypt’s Hosni Mubarak, he co-chaired a “Summit of Peacemakers” in Sharm al-\nSheikh with the participation not just of an equally concerned King Hussein, and of\ncourse Arafat, but leaders of Arab states from North Africa to Saudi Arabia and the\nGulf. The only significant holdout was Syria’s Hafez al-Assad. He objected\nbecause he said the conference was too focused on Israel. As Foreign Minister, I\naccompanied Shimon to the summit. A single day’s meeting was never going to\nend terror. But it was unprecedented in the breadth of Arab engagement in an\ninitiative that, as Assad had anticipated, didn’t just condemn terror in general. It\nspecifically denounced the attacks being launched inside Israel.\n\n288\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028136\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

When they found out that I hadn’t led\nmuch of a normal existence they only probed me with more questions,\nwhich being put on the spot answered honestly. The funny thing was they\ndidn’t seem appalled at all by my statements, rather entertained if\nanything.

Cupping them in\nher hands she moved her lips across my nipples, licking and teasing them\nwith her tongue making them cold and stiff. Next her hands moved down\nto my little white skirt, removing the final piece of my remaining\nuniform. She slid my skirt down my legs with ease, for a moment keeping\non my love-heart panties, so they could both take notice of my apparent\nyouth. They even snickered to each other about “ How cute she still wears\nlittle girl pantie’s” Jeffrey said, and Ghislane joined in his laughter.\nActing as my madam, she instructed me to start by licking his nipples\nand after I had sufficiently pleasured both of them, then prompted me to\ngo down on Jeffery orally while she rubbed her breasts along his body\ntantalizingly. She moved behind me again this time to remove my panties\nand start fondling the delicate folds between my legs. | was still in shock\nfrom the initial degrading blow. I hadn’t even let the reality sink in, it was\nall too much for me to emotionally handle so instead I hid behind my\nfears, which I told myself “I wasn’t going to ever be worth anything at all\nand this would probably be as good as it gets for me” after all I thought,\n\n25\n\nCl Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004158\n\n“what have I been trained up for until now”. Nobody ever stopped to ask\nif | was comfortable or if I wanted to stop, no, instead, Ghislane only\ndirected me to conclude the massage session by climbing up on the table\nto be fixated on Jeffrey, straddling him so he could penetrate me.\n\nWhen it was all done and over with, I was taken into the steam room\nwith just Jeffrey to get further aquatinted, as Ghislane left the room to go\nget dressed. He asked me to grab his feet and rub them not saying a word\nabout what just happened, like it was all normal and accepted. I listened\nto him ramble on about the health benefits of a sauna and the history of it,\nignoring the fact of the matter of his pretentiousness degrading my spirit.\nI figured I had gone too far already, what would be the point in throwing\nin the towel now after I had done exactly what these people wanted.\n\nWhilst we were sweating out our bodies’ toxins, and the steam was\nblasting my burning face I listened to his lessons, entertaining his ego, I\nlet him become my teacher, he seemed to like that. He sounded like a\nvery clever and intelligent man though. Telling me his story of how he\nmade himself an empire of billions from being a middle-class professor to\nan elite financial advisor for clientele with only billions in their bank\naccounts and through his so-called “lessons”, He became my mentor and\nI emerged as his pupil, the teacher’s pet.\n\nAfter the sauna we went to the next glass door beside us where the\nshower was. He turned tap outwards and stood underneath the water as 1\nstood naked and cold from the temperature difference. Instead of asking\nme to join him under the warm stream, like I thought he was going to, he\nhanded me a bar of soap and asked me to wash his body from top to toe.\nIt didn’t stop there I had to massage the shampoo and conditioner into his\nscalp as well.

He allowed the chips to fall where they may and they\noften fall on the head of the current office holders around the world.\n\nProsecuting Wikileaks or its founder for “the crime” of publishing classified information, while at\nthe same time rewarding -- with prizes, access, interviews, and status — “reputable” journalists and\nnewspapers for doing essentially the same thing, would constitute selective prosecution.\nAmerican law, as distinguished for example from German law, generally permits selective\nprosecution of criminals, on the ground that resources are limited and prosecutors must have\nsome discretion in deciding how to expend their limited resources. In order to “get the most bang\nfor the buck”, prosecutors are generally free to pick and choose among the many who violate\nbroad, open-ended and often vague criminal statutes, such as tax, regulatory and criminal\nnegligence laws. They are not free to exercise this discretion in a partisan manner: going after\nmembers of the opposing political party. Nor can they properly do so on the basis of race,\nreligion or other protected categories. But they may select for prosecution the most visible or\nnotorious offenders, since such prosecutions are likely to have the greatest deterrent effect on\nother potential law violators. For example, Leona Helmsley, one of the most famous women in\nAmerica, was indicted for tax evasion on April 15™!\n\nOne area in which it is dangerous and wrong to permit selective prosecution is the publication of\nclassified information by the media. If the government can pick and choose the few it decides to\nprosecute among the many who publish classified information, it will have far too much power\nover the content of what the media reports.** The First Amendment recognizes no distinction\nbetween the patriotic and unpatriotic, the responsible and irresponsible, the favorable or\nunfavorable, media. It was precisely these improper distinctions that were employed by the John\nAdams administration when it selectively enforced the Alien and Sedition laws against\n“Jeffersonians”’, “Jacobins”, and other perceived enemies of the Federalists. It took more than a\ncentury and a half for the Supreme Court to declare that although “.. the Sedition Act was never\ntested in this court, the attack upon its validity has carried the day in the ‘court of history’, citing\n“a broad consensus that the act was inconsistent with the First Amendment”. (I was a law clerk\nwhen that opinion was issued in 1964.)\n\n‘48 The Supreme Court has recognized, in the context of the First Amendment, that a law purporting to regulate\nspeech or press, in order to survive the “strict scrutiny” standard of review required by the First Amendment, must\nnot be overinclusive or underinclusive. See Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn.: “Underinclusiveness raises\nserious doubts about whether the government is in fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than disfavoring a\nparticular speaker or viewpoint... And finally, the Act’s purported aid to parental authority is vastly overinclusive.\nNot all of the children who are forbidden to purchase violent video games on their own have parents who care\nwhether they purchase violent video games. While some of the legislation’s effect may indeed be in support of\nwhat some parents of the restricted children actually want, its entire effect is only in support of what the State\nthinks parents ought to want. This is not the narrow tailoring to “assistant parents” that restriction of First\nAmendment rights requires...California’s legislation straddles the fence between (1) addressing a serious social\nproblem and (2) helping concerned parents control their children. Both ends are legitimate, but when they affect\nFirst Amendment rights they must be pursued by means that are neither seriously underinclusive nor seriously\noverinclusive. See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993) As a means of\nprotecting children from portrayals of violence, the legislation is seriously underinclusive, not only because it\nexcludes portrayals other than video games, but also because it permits a parental or avuncular veto. And as a\nmeans of assisting concerned parents it is seriously overinclusive because it abridges the First Amendment rights\nof young people whose parents (and aunts and uncles) think violent video games are a harmless pastime. And the\noverbreadth in achieving one goal is not cured by the underbreadth in achieving the other. Legislation such as\nthis, which is neither fish nor fowl, cannot survive strict scrutiny.”\n\n127\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017214\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

And then I started\nto look at flight logs. There were -- there were some\nvery interesting things that I noticed on the flight\nlogs.\n\nOne of the things I noticed was when I began\nto, you know, get into this, that, you know, I was\nwondering, well, what -- well, how do these flight logs\ncome into the possession of, you know, law enforcement\nagencies? And the answer turned out to be that they had\nbeen provided by Epstein’s defense attorney and -~- and,\nyou know, coincidentally, I suppose, or in my mind,\nsuspiciously, they were not provided by just any defense\nattorney on this rather large defense team. They were\nprovided by one attorney according to Detective Recarey.\nDetective Recarey testified under oath that the flight\nlogs were provided to him by Alan Dershowitz.\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n92\n\nSo one of the things that was -- was\ninteresting is, Dershowitz has had access to these\nflight logs, and now I'm beginning to wonder, well, has\nthere been an opportunity to sanitize those flight logs\nor remove any incriminating information?\n\nAnd -- and one of the things that was\ninteresting about the flight logs that were produced --\n\nI believe just so the record is clear, that was Exhibit\n1 that -- if we could -- if I could refer -- I need to\nrefresh my recollection as to -- well, I don't -~ you\nmay not want me to look at documents,\n\nIt was either Exhibit 1 or 2 this morning\nduring Dershowitz's deposition which was covering a time\nperiod of January to, I believe, September 2005. These\nwere flight logs that were produced by Mr. Dershowitz to\nthe Palm Beach Police Department.\n\nAnd you wonder why did they stop in\nSeptember -- you know, why stop in September 2005?\nWhat's the significance of that? Well, later on,\nadditional flight logs were obtained, and sure enough,\nwho shows up on an October 2005 flight log with Jeffrey\nEpstein? Mr. Dershowitz.\n\nSo that led to a suspicion that\nMr. Dershowitz had provided to the Palm Beach Police\nDepartment flight logs that, the time period of which\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010832\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

They were under the age of consent in\nFlorida.\n\nAnd so each and every one of those events was\na crime being perpetrated -- and let's be clear, not\njust being perpetrated by Epstein, but by other people\nwho were involved there at the mansion.\n\nAnd so what the -- the Palm Beach Police\nDepartment was putting together was that this mansion in\nFlorida was the nest of sexual abuse of young girls here\nin Florida that involved, literally, in the -- in this\nperiod of time, more than a hundred events that they\nwere able to document of sexual abuse.\n\nAnd when you put that together with the\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n68\npattern or practice that was being revealed there, there\nwere hundreds of acts of sexual abuse going on in the\nmansion.\n\nBut then what becomes -- and this is where I\nindicated that, you know, the answer would continue on,\nThe -- the problem was that the evidence was starting to\nshow that this was a much broader series of events.

For example, we are seeing evidence that --\nlet's just talk about Virginia Roberts since she's\ncentral to this case.\n\nWe are seeing Virginia Roberts being flown\nfrom Florida to New York where she's in the clutches of\nJeffrey Epstein who is sexually abusing her, you know,\nmany times a week.

Out of whatever. It started with modeling as a kid,\nbuilding models. When computers came along, I started\nlearning programming and realizing the computer was this\ngreat tool for making things, making models, dynamic models,\nand behaviors, not just static models. I think when I started\ndoing games I really wanted to carry that to the next step, to\nthe player, so that you give the player a tool so that they can\ncreate things. And then you give them some context for that\ncreation. You know, what is it, what kind of kind of world\n\ndoes it live in, what’s its purpose? What are you trying to do\nwith this thing that you’re creating? To really put the player\n\nin the design role. And the actual world is reactive to their\ndesign. So they design something that the little world inside\nthe computer reacts to. And then they have to revisit the\ndesign and redesign it, or tear it down and build another one,\nwhatever it is. So I guess what really draws me to interactive\nentertainment and the thing that I try to keep focused on is\nenabling the creativity of the player. Giving them a pretty large\nsolution space to solve the problem within the game. So the\ngame represents this problem landscape. Most games have\nsmall solution landscapes, so there’s one possible solution and\none way to solve it. Other games, the games that tend to be\nmore creative, have a much larger solution space, so you can\npotentially solve this problem in a way that nobody else has. If\nyou're building a solution, how large that solution space is gives\nthe player a much stronger feeling of empathy. If they know\nthat what they’ve done is unique to them, they tend to care for\nit a lot more. I think that’s the direction I tend to come from.”\n\nWright believes that simulations as games\ncan be used to improve education by teaching\nchildren how to learn. In his own words:\n\n“The problem with our education system is we’ve\ntaken this kind of narrow, reductionist, Aristotelian approach\nto what learning is. It’s not designed for experimenting\nwith complex systems and navigating your way through\nthem in an intuitive way, which is what games teach. It’s not\n\nreally designed for failure, which is also something games\nteach. I mean, I think that failure is a better teacher than\nsuccess. Trial and error, reverse-engineering stuff in your\nmind—all the ways that kids interact with games—that’s\nthe kind of thinking schools should be teaching. And I\nwould argue that as the world becomes more complex, and\nas outcomes become less about success or failure, games\nare better at preparing you. The education system is going\nto realize this sooner or later. It’s starting. Teachers are\nentering the system who grew up playing games. They’re\ngoing to want to engage with the kids using games.”\n\nWright will appear as a character in the video game\nMr. T, where he will team up with Mr. T to fight Nazis.\n\nWright was given a “Lifetime Achievement\nAward” at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2001.\n\nIn 2002, he became the fifth person to be inducted into the\nAcademy of Interactive Arts and Sciences’ Hall of Fame.\nUntil 2006, he was the only person to have been honored\nthis way by both of these industry organizations. In 2007\nthe British Academy of Film and Television Arts awarded\nhim a fellowship, the first given to a game designer.\n\nHe has been called one of the most important\npeople in gaming, technology, and entertainment by\npublications such as Entertainment Weekly, Time, PC Gamer,\nDiscover and GameSpy. Wright was also awarded the PC\nMagazine Lifetime Achievement Award in January 2005.\n\nIn 1980, along with co-driver and race organizer\nRick Doherty, Wright participated in the U.S. Express,\n\na cross-country race that was the predecessor to The\nCannonball Run. Wright and Doherty drove a specially\noutfitted Mazda RX-7 from Brooklyn, New York to Santa\nMonica, California in 33:39, winning the illegal race. Wright\nonly competed once in the race, which continued until 1983.\n\nSince 2003, in his spare time, Wright has collected\nleftovers from the Soviet space program, “including a\n100-pound hatch from a space shuttle, a seat from a\nSoyuz... control panels from the Mir”, and the control\n\nconsole of the Soyuz 23, as well as dolls, dice, and\nfossils. During E3 2004 he passed off an old lapel pin\ncommemorating the Soviet space program to a reporter.\n“T’m uncollecting. I buy collections on eBay, and I\ndisperse them out to people again. I have to be like an entropic\nforce to collectors, otherwise all of this stuff will get sorted.”\nHe once built competitive robots for BattleBots\nwith his daughter, but no longer does so. As of November\n2006, Wright still had remnant bits of machined metal left\nover from his BattleBots days strewn about the garage of his\nOakland home. Wright was a former Robot Wars champion\nin the Berkeley-based robotics workshop, the Stupid Fun\nClub. One of Wright’s bots, designed with the help of Wright’s\ndaughter Cassidy, “Kitty Puff Puff”, fought against its\nopponents by sticking a roll of gauze onto its armature and\ncircling around them, encapsulating them and denying them\nmovement. The technique, cocooning, was eventually banned.\nFollowing his work in BattleBots, he has taken\nsteps into the field of human-robot interactions.\n“We build these robots and we take them down to\nBerkeley and study the interactions that people have with\nthe robots,” says Wright. “We built this newer one that has a\nrapid-fire pingpong cannon. It will fire about 10 per second.\nSo we give people this plastic bat and we say, ‘It’s set up to\nplay baseball. Do you want to play baseball? It’s going to\nshoot a little ball and you try to hit it.’ And all of a sudden\nit’s like da-da-da-da, and it’s pelting them with balls.”\nAfter building his reputation as one of the most\nimportant game designers in the world, Wright in 2009\nleft Maxis, the Electronic Arts owned studio he founded.\nHis first post-E.A. venture was the Stupid Fun Club.\nIn October 2010, Current TV announced that\nWill Wright will produce a new show for the network. The\nprogram, entitled Bar Karma, began airing in February 2011.\nIn October 2011, Will Wright became\na member of the Board of Directors of Linden\nLab, the creators of Second Life.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017566\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

While the sources of our returns will generally be idiosyncratic, there is no question that the\ntremendous amount of capital that has flown into the low-net multi-manager, i.e. “platform”, category, has\ncreated an even greater risk of exposure to “Platform Beta” for some of our managers, even while avoiding\nbroader equity market beta.\n\nPlatform Beta is a term we have heard used to describe the overlap of long and short positions, across some\nof the largest market-neutral, multi-manager hedge fund managers. While these overlapping names may be\nviewed as “smart money” positioning in some sense, there is also meaningful risk associated with being in\ncrowded longs and shorts due to the viciousness of the cascading effects when these portfolios are being\nliquidated, or re-sized quickly, as we observed in Q1 2016. For a variety of reasons, we believe that\nPlatform Beta has a true positive expectancy over time and with much less risk than other traditional factor\nrisks, especially ones taken on by long-only or long-biased investors. While we consider it to be an obvious\ngoal to avoid material exposure to all known market risk factors, we also attempt to reduce our more\ndifficult to measure Platform Beta exposure when possible. Despite the positive return expectation of\nPlatform Beta, we do not think a large or concentrated exposure to this factor is beneficial. Perhaps even\nmore importantly, we do not believe that all alpha is created equally, and we are trying to provide the most\nuncorrelated alpha as possible to our investors.\n\nSo how do we minimize overexposure to Platform Beta? We can monitor data that imperfectly points to\ncrowded names or themes, but the most direct way we seek to avoid crowded names is through our overall\nportfolio construction and manager-selection process. This is demonstrated in our continued focus on “First\nLoss” allocations as well as investments in the strategy category we call “Other”, which is comprised of\nniche strategies outside our more traditional long/short fundamental and quantitative strategies. These\nalternative categories have served as a valuable source of alpha as well as diversification away from\nPlatform Beta. Additionally, even in our more traditional strategies, we focus on allocating to smaller\nmanagers who can have larger parts of their portfolios in smaller capitalization companies, which tend to be\nless trafficked by the larger funds, and therefore are also less subject to the effects of large industry\ndeleveraging. We cannot avoid all of the dangers of hedge fund deleveraging but our conscious attempts to\ntarget differentiated strategies, and to limit concentration, has allowed us to be less impacted by these flows\nthan several other multi-manager platforms.\n\nPortfolio Attribution and Risk\n\nWithin our Multi-Strategy platform, the “Other” category was the largest contributor for both Q4 and 2016\noverall, contributing gross returns of +0.82% in Q4 and +2.19% YTD. The remaining quarterly and full-year\ngross return attribution within the Multi-Strategy platform were: “Fundamental L/S” at -0.86% in Q4 and\n+1.16% YTD, and “Quantitative” at 0.29% in Q4 and -1.53% YTD. Our First Loss platform allocations\ncontributed gross-returns of +0.72% in Q4 and +6.60% YTD.”\n\nThe Fund averaged approximately 0.39% daily Value at Risk during Q4 vs. 0.41% in Q3 (95% Confidence\nInterval, excluding First-Loss allocations). As stated in last quarter’s letter, we expect to see an increase in\nour VaR during Q1 2017 primarily through a combination of new manager allocations and a pick-up in\noverall market volatility due to macro events on the horizon.

Many had held the title, but one of the\nmost frequent winners was White House counsel Don McGahn. He was\na constant target for his boss's belittling, mocking, falsetto-voice mimicry,\nand, as well, sweeping disparagements of his purpose and usefulness.\n\n“This is why we can’t have nice things,” McGahn uttered almost obses-\nsively under his breath, quoting the Taylor Swift song to comment on\nwhatever egregious act Trump had just committed (“ . . because you break\nthem,” the song continues).\n\nMcGahn's background was largely as a federal election lawyer. Mostly\nhe was on the more-money, less-transparency side—he was against, rather\nthan for, aggressive enforcement of election laws. He served as the counsel\nto the Trump campaign, arguably among the most careless about election\nlaw compliance in recent history. Before joining the Trump administra-\ntion, McGahn had no White House or executive branch experience. He\nhad never worked in the Justice Department or, in fact, anywhere in gov-\nernment. Formerly an attorney for a nonprofit affiliated with the Koch\nbrothers, he was known as a hyperpartisan: when Obama’s White House\ncounsel, Kathy Ruemmler, the previous occupant of McGahr’s office,\nreached out to congratulate him and to offer to be a resource on past prac-\ntices, McGahn did not respond to her email.\n\ni\n:\n'\n;\nI\n\nSIEGE 39\n\nOne of McGahn's jobs was to navigate what was possibly the most\ncomplicated relationship in modern government: he was the effective\npoint person between the White House and the Department of Justice.\nPart of his portfolio, then, was to endure the president's constant rage and\nbewilderment about why the DO] was personally hounding him, and his\nincomprehension that he could do nothing about it.\n\n“It’s my Justice Department,’ Trump would tell McGahn, often repeat-\ning this more than dubious declaration in his signature triad.\n\nNobody could quite be certain of the number of times McGahn had\nhad to threaten, with greater or lesser intention, to quit if Trump made\ngood on his threat to fire the attorney general, the deputy attorney gen-\neral, or the special counsel. Curiously, one defense against the charge that\nthe president had tried to fire Mueller in June 2017 in an effort to end the\nspecial counsel's investigation—as the New York Times claimed in a Jan-\nuary 2018 scoop—was the fact that Trump was almost constantly trying\nto fire Mueller or other DOJ figures, doing so often multiple times a day.\n\nMcGahn’s steadying hand had so far helped avert an ultimate crisis.\nBut he had missed or let slip by or simply ignored a number of intemper-\nate, unwise, and interfering actions by the president that might, McGahn\nfeared, comprise the basis of obstruction charges. Deeply involved with the\nconservative Federalist Society and its campaign for “textualist” judges.\nMcGahn had long dreamed himself of becoming a federal judge him-\nself, but given the no-man’-land he occupied between Trump and the\nJustice Department—not to mention Trump’s sometimes daily attacks or\nthe DOJ’s independence, which McGahn had to accept or condone—he\nknew his future as a jurist was dead.\n\n+ oF\n\nFifteen months into Trumps tenure, the tensions between the administra-\ntion and the Department of Justice had erupted into open conflict. Now it\nwas war—the White House against its own DO).\n\nHere was a modern, post-Watergate paradox: the independence o:\nthe Justice Department. The DOJ might be, from every organizationa\nand statutory view, an instrument of the White House, and, as much a:\nany other agency, its mission might appear to be driven by whoever hele\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021143\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But you would never\nproceed to deliver the second property before I paid for the first one, unless you\nwere a fool.” I also warned of longer-term dangers: “terrorism, radical Islamic\nfundamentalism, the proliferation of surface-to-surface missiles and weapons of\nmass destruction, and threats to the long-term stability of the more pragmatic\nArab regimes.” I singled out Iran, because it was determined to export its brand\nof fundamentalism Islam, sponsor terror and develop a nuclear weapon.\n\nI also accompanied CSIS colleagues on speaking engagements to other\nAmerican cities. I was about to board a flight to Seattle in April when I got a\nmessage saying Rabin wanted to talk to me. After we took off, I used the on-\nboard phone facility and, with a swipe of a credit card, was soon on the line to\nthe Prime Minister. Since the exchange was in Hebrew, I’m fairly sure anyone\noverhearing me had no idea what we were talking about. “I need you to come\nback as soon as possible,” Rabin said. I already knew, from Giora, that he was\nanxious to find a long-term replacement as Minister of Interior. The leading\nlight in the Sephardi religious party Shas, Arye Deri, had had to leave the post\nunder allegations of bribe-taking. After Rabin had taken on the portfolio himself\nfour 18 months, he had placed Labor’s Uzi Baram there, but only as a\ntemporary arrangement. I didn’t feel I could refuse outright. But I reminded him\nthat under army rules, “as soon as possible” still meant another 100 days. And\nideally, I said I wanted to finish the best part of a year in Washington. I asked\nwhether it would be possible to join the cabinet in the middle of November\ninstead. “What difference will a few more months make?”\n\nRabin said he needed me now, and that mid-November would be too late.\n“Ehud, in politics, you can never predict what will happen by then.” Neither of\nus could have known how terribly prophetic his words would turn out to be.\n\nI was not only new to cabinet politics. I wasn’t even a member of the\nKnesset.

No one was being prevented from\nexpressing his or her views. The Quincy House Film Society was going to show Deep Throat; the\nHarvard administration was expressing but not imposing its views; the feminists were preparing\npamphlets, slide shows, and speakers to present theirs; and everyone was free to see and listen to\nall or none of these expressions.\n\nThe feminists seemed to be making their point quite effectively: more students were expected on\nthe picket lines and at the slide show than at the movie itself. Many in the Harvard community,\nwhile supporting the right of the Quincy House Film Society to show Deep Throat, now believed\nthat the society had been insensitive to the feelings of their feminist housemates by exhibiting an\noffensive film in the dormitory that was home to them all. I shared that view.\n\nThen everything changed. Days before the scheduled showing, two women residents of Quincy\nHouse, not satisfied to protest and picket, called the local District Attorney’s office and asked the\npolice to prevent the showing of Deep Throat and to arrest the students who were planning to\nshow it.\n\nThe local District Attorney was an elderly political hack named John Droney, who had repeatedly\nwon reelection on an uncompromising law-and-order platform. When he learned that the twin\nevils of obscenity and Harvard might merge on that fateful night, he dispatched an assistant to\ncourt in an effort to secure an injunction against the scheduled showing.\n\nIf there is anything more obnoxious to a civil libertarian than the punishment of speech after it has\ntaken place, it is the issuance of a prior injunction to prevent speech in the first place. Prior\nrestraint—as an injunction against speech has come to be known—s the purest form of\ncensorship. It seeks to prevent the speech from ever reaching the public. Now, almost ten years\nafter the Supreme Court had rebuffed efforts to enjoin publication of the Pentagon Papers, the\nDistrict Attorney of Middlesex County was seeking to enjoin the showing of a dirty movie to a\nsmall group of students in a college dormitory at Harvard.\n\nOnly hours before the scheduled performance, Carl Stork and Nathan J. Hagen—the co-\npresidents of the Quincy House Film Society—received telephone calls from the D.A.’s office\ndirecting them to be in Judge Charles R. Alberti’s courtroom at two o’clock for a hearing. Stork\nand Hagen tried to call me in my office. But I was at lunch, and my secretary couldn’t locate me.\nStork and Hagen told her the story and requested that I come to the court to assist them as soon\nas possible. I returned from lunch at two-fifteen, to learn that I was expected in court—fifteen\nminutes earlier!\n\nI quickly borrowed a colleague’s ill-fitting jacket, dug an old brown tie out of my desk drawer,\nand drove to the courthouse in downtown Cambridge.\n\nWithin minutes, I found myself before Judge Alberti, arguing against the injunction. With no\nbooks, cases, or statutes in my possession, I had to wing it. The judge was most understanding,\n\nasking the Assistant District Attorney to let me look over his shoulder at the relevant statute and\ncases.\n\n113\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017200\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

She co-founded and serves on the steering\ncommittee for the Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) Lab and is a co-principal investigator in\nBerkeley’s Center for Human-Compatible Al.\n\nAt the core of artificial intelligence is our mathematical definition of what an AI agent (a\nrobot) is. When we define a robot, we define states, actions, and rewards. Think of a\ndelivery robot, for instance. States are locations in the world, and actions are motions\nthat the robot makes to get from one position to a nearby one. To enable the robot to\ndecide on which actions to take, we define a reward function—a mapping from states and\nactions to scores indicating how good that action was in that state—and have the robot\nchoose actions that accumulate the most “reward.” The robot gets a high reward when it\nreaches its destination, and it incurs a small cost every time it moves; this reward function\nincentivizes the robot to get to the destination as quickly as possible. Similarly, an\nautonomous car might get a reward for making progress on its route and incur a cost for\ngetting too close to other cars.\n\nGiven these definitions, a robot’s job is to figure out what actions it should take in\norder to get the highest cumulative reward. We’ve been working hard in AI on enabling\nrobots to do just that. Implicitly, we’ve assumed that if we’re successful—if robots can\ntake any problem definition and turn into a policy for how to act—we will get robots that\nare useful to people and to society.\n\nWe haven’t been too wrong so far. If you want an AI that classifies cells as either\ncancerous or benign, or a robot that vacuums the living room rug while you’re at work,\nwe've got you covered. Some real-world problems can indeed be defined in isolation,\nwith clear-cut states, actions, and rewards. But with increasing AI capability, the\nproblems we want to tackle don’t fit neatly into this framework. We can no longer cut\noff a tiny piece of the world, put it in a box, and give it to a robot. Helping people is\nstarting to mean working in the real world, where you have to actually interact with\npeople and reason about them. “People” will have to formally enter the AI problem\ndefinition somewhere.\n\nAutonomous cars are already being developed. They will need to share the road\nwith human-driven vehicles and pedestrians and learn to make the trade-off between\ngetting us home as fast as possible and being considerate of other drivers. Personal\nassistants will need to figure out when and how much help we really want and what types\nof tasks we prefer to do on our own versus what we can relinquish control over. A DSS\n(Decision Support System) or a medical diagnostic system will need to explain its\nrecommendations to us so we can understand and verify them. Automated tutors will\nneed to determine what examples are informative or illustrative—not to their fellow\nmachines but to us humans.\n\nLooking further into the future, if we want highly capable Als to be compatible\nwith people, we can’t create them in isolation from people and then try to make them\ncompatible afterward; rather, we’ll have to define “human-compatible” AI from the get-\ngo. People can’t be an afterthought.\n\n98\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016318\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We can expect\npotential forthcoming advances around the control of information feeds with applications in\nspreading propaganda, via spreading false or misleading information, creating anxiety, fueling\nconspiracy theories, and influencing voting. Such methods will bring key challenges to democracy.\n\nCHALLENGES AHEAD WITH Al, PROPOGANDA, AND PERSUASION\n\nData-centric analyses have been long used in marketing, advertising, and campaigning over\ndecades. However, over the past few years, we have seen the rise of the use of more powerful\ntools, including machine learning and inference aimed at algorithmic manipulation, with the target\nof influencing the thinking and actions of people. Some initial uses of these methods reportedly\nplayed a role in influencing the outcome of recent US presidential elections, as well as the\nelections in 2008 and 2012. We can expect to see an upswing in methods that manipulate states of\ninformation in a personalized automated manner. These systems can be designed and deployed as\nomnipresent/persistent, and aimed at specific goals for group- or person-centric persuasion.\n\nAs our data and models of how people consume and act on information improve, and as an\nincreasing portion of information consumption is mediated through digital systems managed by\npotentially opaque algorithms, it becomes increasingly conceivable that the information ecosystem\nwould get captured by malicious actors deploying increasingly advanced tools to control, shape,\nforge and personalize information, from ads to news reports.\n\nMachine learning, in conjunction with active learning, expected value decision making, and\noptimization of allocations of key resources, such as dollars or human effort, can be targeted at\nmonitoring, understanding, and then working to influence the beliefs and actions of large\npopulations of people. Data can be collected from large-scale populations, across multiple devices\nand services, and used to make inferences about the psychologies and beliefs of people, and for\ndesigning and guiding persuasive flows of sequences of information. Uses of Al can include\nattempts to optimize stealthiness of the interventions.\n\nIn the future, a great deal of the information consumed by citizens on personal devices is subject\nto alteration by information-engineers at media corporations and governmental propaganda\noffices, such that outside a few key positions of power no one really knows what is going on in the\nworld. There is a danger of the growth of domination over time of large populations by a single\ndominant or a few systems.

The Obama\nadministration found that conflicted advice cost\nsavers about $17 billion a year based on a 2015\nreport. To be clear, the Rule applies only to retire-\nment accounts like 401(k)s and individual retire-\nment accounts (“IRAs”), not to regular taxable\naccounts. According to the Investment Company\nInstitute, Americans invest $7.8 trillion in IRAs\nand $7 trillion in 401(k)s.\n\nOn January 20, 2017, the DOL issued two new\nsets of Frequently Asked Questions (“FAQs”) on\nthe Rule. One of the sets of FAQs focuses on the\nnew definition of fiduciary investment advice\nand the other set is geared toward retirement\ninvestors and consumers, covering consumer\nprotection features of the new Rule. This is the\nsecond of three rounds of guidance to be pub-\nlished by the DOL prior to the effective date of\nthe new Rule.\n\nThe Executive Branch also issued responses to\nthe Rule on January 20, 2017. The White House\nissued a Memorandum from Reince Priebus to the\nheads of the executive departments and agencies\nrequesting a sixty (60)-day delay as the effective\ndate of regulations published in the Office of the\nFederal Register have not taken effect as of yet.\n\nOn February 3, 2017, President Trump signed a\npresidential memorandum to delay the Rule by\nsix (6)-months, casting doubt on its viability.\nThe memorandum instructs the DOL to conduct\n\na new “economic and legal analysis’ to deter-\nmine whether the Rule is likely to harm inves-\ntors, disrupt the industry or cause an increase\nin litigation and the price of advice. If the DOL\nconcludes that the regulation does hurt inves-\ntors or firms, it can propose a rule “rescind-\ning or revising” the regulation. On March 1,\n2017, the DOL issued a proposed rule, which\nwill extend the applicability date of its fidu-\nciary rule, including the Best Interest Contract\nExemption, from April 10, 2017 to June 9, 2017,\na 60-day delay.\n\nSome are saying the Rule would hurt investors\nbecause it would supposedly make it harder\nfor people to receive retirement advice. For\nexample, advisers would not be able to afford\nto service low-balance retirement accounts.\nOn the other hand, consumer, labor and civil\nrights groups have pushed for the Rule saying\nthat the current system provides a loophole\nthat lets brokers drain money from retirement\naccounts in fees they receive that can sway\nthe investment advice they give their retire-\nment accounts. We see that many retirement\nadvisers already have chosen to act in their\nclients’ best interests, opting to work under\nthe fiduciary standard—it is ultimately a\nbusiness advantage.\n\nThe FAQs are available on the DOL’s website\nand the Memoranda are available on the White\nHouse Press Office website.\n\nFAQs\nhttps://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/\nabout-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/\nfaqs/coi-rules-and-exemptions-part-2. pdf\n\nhttps://www.dol. gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/\nabout-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/\nconsumer-protections-for-retirement-investors-\nyour-rights-and-financial-advisers.pdf\n\nMemoranda\n\nJanuary 20, 2017—Regulatory Freeze Pending\nReview\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-\noffice/2017/01/20/memorandum-heads-execu-\ntive-departments-and-agencies\n\nFebruary 3, 2017—Fiduciary Duty Rule\n\nhttps ://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/\n2017/02/03/ presidential-memorandum-fiduciary-\nduty-rule\n\nDaniel G.

Obviously. Were we normal? Unfortunately, yes. A few months ago, I\nchatted with another American HIV educator about the situation here in Africa. \"They\nknow to use condoms,\" she complained, \"and they have the condoms! I just don't get it!\"\n\n\"I agree that it's incomprehensible,\" I said, \"but hey, I haven't always been 100% careful,\nand I'm a sex educator.\"\n\nShe glanced at me, then away. \"Yeah, I haven't either,” she admitted. There was a gloomy\npause, and then we couldn't help it -- we cracked up. \"I hate love,\" she said when the\ngiggles subsided. She shook her head. \"That shit fucks with you.\"\n\nWhy didn't I use condoms with that ex? I still don't know! When you instruct people to\nuse condoms as often as I do, you get accustomed to the arguments. I hear the same\nreasons we didn't use condoms -- because they don't feel as good, because they interrupt\nthe moment, etc. etc. etc. -- I hear them, I smile and I tell the audience, \"You gotta use\n‘em anyway, folks.\" I'm a hypocrite, but what else can I say?\n\nAnd there are deeper-rooted objections to condoms -- objections that are both rarely\nstated in public, and harder to confront. One is trust, which I've been struggling with for a\nlong time, since before I got to Africa. I don't think it's good for condom discussions to\ncenter on trust, and I wish I had more ideas about how to refocus them. \"Use condoms\nbecause you can't trust anyone, not even your lover,\" is an ugly message to impart.\nMoreover, it only encourages the audience to view not using condoms as a gift, or a\nsignifier of trust.\n\nIn America, I tend to cast it like this: \"Safer sex is normal. It's the baseline. Lots of people\npractice it. It's an assumption. Act like it.\" Which, I hope, helps people simply default to\nsafer sex without forcing direct questions about any given partner's integrity. Hopefully,\nit also distracts attention from seeing discarding condoms as a gift. But the truth is that\ncondom usage isn't always an assumption even in America (witness myself and my ex).\nAnd it's less of an assumption here in Africa. How can I avoid validating the viewpoint\nthat not using condoms is the best way to express trust?\n\nThe second deep-rooted objection -- again, both in Africa and America -- is inability to\nmaintain an erection while using a condom. When I was younger, I used to think that\nguys were just whining when they claimed they couldn't keep it up with a condom, but in\nmy old age I've determined that People Are Different (no way!): while most men deal\nwith condoms just fine, some men genuinely can't. Since people tend to be bad at\ncommunicating about sex and especially bad at making space for conversations about\nnon-normative male sexuality, this isn't often acknowledged. Fortunately, the solution is\neasy: men who have trouble with condomised penis-in-vagina sex gain a glorious\nopportunity to explore all the other kinds of sex!\n\nPeople tend to panic when confronted with the idea of a man who can't have penetrative\nsex. But that's sex-negative nonsense based entirely on the stereotype of \"real sex\" as\npenis-in-vagina intercourse. The solution to loss of erection isn't to sit around awkwardly\nwishing you could be having penetrative sex. The solution is for both partners to start\nexploring with mouths, hands... and words. But teaching about this means speaking very\nexplicitly, and it can be hard to have those conversations in a conservative society\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018591\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The quantity of\ninformation we are looking at here is greater than the storage capacity of\nthe Universe and would collapse space-time to a black hole before I got\neven a fraction of the way through. Let us try to be a bit cleverer about\nthe task of creating this information.\n\nThe simplest way to tie the computer down is to run a much\nstricter program.

The average global growth pace of the past 3 months has fallen to only 1.8%, barely more than half of trend. The expectation\nremains that Q1 should come in at 2.4% as both Japan and the Euro area exit recession.\n\n° While staying overall long risk markets, both credit and equities at the moment, we have increasingly focused on tactical\ncross-market exposures, and in particular the underweight of US equities. In GMOS this week, we took profit on the overweight of\nEuro area equities against the US given the still very weak economy, with Q4 likely now the biggest GDP decline since the end of the\nglobal recession (We do stay overweight Euro periphery bond). But we remain aggressively overweight both Japan and EM Asia\nversus the US, with Japan currency hedged. The upside surprise on Chinese CPI today dented its equity market somewhat, but we\nthink this will be temporary as it should not yet lead to monetary tightening. The recent set of strong trade and industrial data from\nChina and the region are signaling to us significant upside risk on Q1 and 2013 growth projections.\n\ne We have been long Japanese equities since Nov 16, which more by luck than skill defined the beginning of its equity rally.\nTopix is up 20% since then, almost straight line. We believe new PM Abe conviction and political power to reflate the economy are\nreal. It has already helped the yen lose 10% versus the dollar. Given this move, faster fiscal easing and support from equities, we have\nraised our 2013 growth forecast for a 3rd time, this time to 0.8%. We stay long the Japanese reflation trade.\n\nFixed Income\n\n° Bonds recovered some of their losses from last week, but remain down on the year. We do not see the current surge in\nequities as a negative for bonds, yet, as equity inflows are not coming out of bond funds, and growth remains too weak to elicit an\nearly end to QE. With USTs very much at the top of their 6-month trading range, we go tactically long duration, but would take profit\nsoon on a decent rally. In the Euro are, in contrast, the continued flow into the periphery should remain negative for Bund and euro\nswaps. We retain a bearish bias here.\n\nEquities\n\n° Equities are up again this week, helped by rapidly improving equity ETF inflows. Strong buying by retail investors is\nadding fuel to equity markets against a backdrop of rather subdued macro drivers, maintaining a positive-near term momentum. The\nreporting season is also helping with US companies beating so far by 2% the bottom up analysts’ estimates at the beginning of the\nyear.\n\n° Our recommended equity portfolio focuses on regional and sectoral exposures. Underweighting US equities remains our\nmain regional theme. This trade also protects our portfolio against looming debt ceiling risks. US equities had been the consensus\noverweight by equity investors for two years and their outperformance started reversing over the summer. US equities have so far\nerased their 2012 outperformance but are far from erasing their 2011 outperformance.\n\ne We focus the US equity underweight against EM Asia and Japan. In GMOS this week, we took profit on our overweight\nin MSCI EMU versus S&P500 given looming Italian election risks into February, and still disappointing European economic activity\ndata. We stay overweight in Topix vs. S&P500 currency hedged. Fiscal easing, financed via debt monetization, and coupled with\nstructural reforms has the potential to sustain this trade beyond a 3-6 month horizon, in our view. This week’s fiscal stimulus\nannounced by the Japanese gov’t appears supportive of the Japanese trade.\n\n° Across sectors we favor Cyclical vs. Defensive sectors but have taken part profit as the pace of the improvement in the global\nmanufacturing PMI slowed in December. We stay overweight the DJ US Home Construction Index and large mortgage banks (BKX\nIndex) vs. the S&P500 to position for a continued recovery in US housing.\n\nCredit\n\n° High-grade spreads and yields were a few bps tighter this week, although US and European high-yield continued to rally\nstrongly. Double-digit spread tightening sent both to new all-time yield lows; now just 5.9% in the US and 6.5% in Europe. The clear\noutlier this week was EMBIG, the ill health of the Venezuelan president and a NY court ruling in favor of hold-out creditors in\nArgentina’s ‘pari passu’ saga helped push spreads up 12bp. We believe such idiosyncrasies driving relative performance signals an\nuncharacteristic break-down in spread correlations and a welcome move-away from the one-factor-drives-all world of late.\n\n° The strength of equity flows has caught our attention this week, but there is little evidence of a wider rotation out of bonds.\nThere has indeed been some evidence of bond into equity fund flows in ETFs (best seen through our flow radars in Flows &\nLiquidity), but bond mutual funds continue to see inflows, which accelerated this week. Also, our client survey reports on-going\ndemand for credit and new issues remain well bid (see CMOS and F&L for more details).\n\nForeign Exchange\n\n° 2013 has started with bubbling optimism across global markets. Equities are approaching five-year highs and credit\nspreads their five-year lows, while government bonds are selling off worldwide and inflation breakevens behave (outside the UK).\nAnd per the traditional pattern, the dollar is falling versus most currencies, except those which entered 2013 with enormous liabilities\n— the yen given Japan’s full-throated commitment to looser monetary and fiscal policy, and the rand on sovereign credit and balance of\npayment concerns. EUR/USD has spiked since Thursday’s ECB meeting but is underperforming much of the commodity complex\n(MXN, CLP, AUD, NZD) year-to-date, highlighting that China's data surprises this week count for as much as a less-worried ECB.\n\n° These country-specific issues are more powerful than systemic ones for the moment, which is likely why correlations\nacross dollar-based pairs have sunk to three-year lows. The yen story still looks to us the most unique — USD/JPY is the only major\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031122\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I have taken friends by the Epstein mansion, and the\nreaction to its other-worldly size in Manhattan is almost always the same: an\nincredulous guffaw. Press accounts, seldom supplying new information, ever\nrecycle and repeat the mysterious (and monstrous) billionaire mythology,\nwith brief glimpses of him stepping out of the house (the same photos\nendlessly republished), and the assumption of depravity inside.\n\nIn fact, the life in the house, without wife or children or conventional\ndomestic demeanor, in some way conforms to the most scripted fantasies: a\nlife somewhere between Daddy Warbucks and Eyes Wide Shut.\n\nThe domesticity of the house, and the background of Epstein’s\nproblems, centers around a group of young women who act as his support\nstaff and companions. Some have worked for him for many years, marrying,\nhaving children, and continuing as part of his business and household\ninfrastructure. One woman, on an afternoon when I was there, recently\nmarried, had just returned from an around the world honeymoon that Epstein\nhad arranged for her. Some are his romantic interests. His present girl friend\nis in dental school. One former girlfriend, Eva Andersson Dubin, a Swedish\nmodel and Miss Universe finalist, became a doctor and married hedge\nfunder Glen Dubin and together they finance the Dubin Breast Center at\nMount Sinai Hospital. Most at one time will travel with him to his floating\nresidences—the ranch in New Mexico, the vast apartment in Paris, the Island\nin the Caribbean, the house in Palm Beach.\n\nThis is so outside of conventional living or staffing or romantic\nrelationships that it is hard to describe in a straightforward way. It\nsometimes seems part of Epstein’s implicit challenge: not just look at me,\nbut do you dare look at me? Or it seems he is just oblivious to what other’s\nare thinking. A sort of fatal tone deafness.\n\nEpstein’s young women mingle freely with his powerful guests, not so\nmuch as hostess or, in tabloid language, harem-like (or as “sex slaves’’), but\noften as attentive students (that, of course, might be regarded as having its\nown fetish-like attraction).\n\nOnce, Epstein invited me to sit in on a day of presentations to him in\nhis dining room by various “quants.” Quant theory involves making\ninvestments based solely on mathematical and statistical models. This\nmethod can often have uncanny predictive powers. But the problem is it\ndoesn’t scale very well—the market, having discerned a pattern of\nsuccessful investing, quickly copies and discounts the advantage.

While they differed from each\nother, they shared the goal of creating preferential treatment for certain pass-through business income. The Act\nlargely took the Senate’s approach but adopted a few elements of the House’s approach. The Act approaches\nsmall business relief by permitting a non-itemized deduction of 20% of qualified business income; the remaining\n80% would then be subject to normal tax rates. Therefore, the top tax rate for business income would be 29.6%\n(80% x 37% = 29.6%). The provision is riddled with a host of complex limitations. For taxpayers not in the top\nincome tax bracket, the value of the deduction will depend on the marginal bracket that would otherwise be\nimposed on the income.\n\nOwners of service businesses (e.g., law, accounting and consulting, etc., but not engineering or architectural\nservices) generally would be eligible for the 20% deduction unless taxable income exceeds $315,000 for married\nfiling jointly ($157,500 for others).

See Preceding Undisputed Facts. Because of the\noutrageousness of Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor girls, Edwards reasonably expected that\nEpstein would also be liable for punitive damages to the girls. Because Edwards could show that\nEpstein had molested children for years and designed a complex premeditated scheme to procure\ndifferent minors everyday to satisfy his addiction to sex with minors, the punitive damages\nwould have to be sufficient to deter him from this illegal conduct that he had engaged in daily for\nyears. Epstein was and is a billionaire. See Complaint, §49 (referring to “Palm Beach\nBillionaire”); see also Epstein Deposition, February 17, 2010, at 172-176 (Deposition\nAttachment #7) (taking the Fifth when asked whether he is a billionaire). Accordingly, Edwards\nreasonably believed the punitive damages that would have to be awarded against Epstein would\nhave been substantial enough to punish him severely enough for his past conduct as well as deter\nhim from repeating his offenses in the future. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit “N” at (19.\n\n85. On July 6, 2010, rather than face trial for the civil suits that had been filed against\nhim by L.M., E.W., and Jane Doe, defendant Epstein settled the cases against him. The terms of\nthe settlement are confidential.

Analysis was\nperformed by the City’s analysts at the Water Treatment Plant’s laboratory. Results from\nHSA’s sampling of the Town’s drinking water from northern-most Tap A (IDSE #6) are directly\ncompared to the City’s routine sampling of drinking water from distribution system tap LINL\n(closest to Tap A). Results from HSA’s sampling of the Town’s drinking water from southern-\nmost Tap B (3230) are compared directly to those from the City’s sampling of that tap. TTHM\nconcentrations from HSA’s November 2008 sampling event are slightly higher than the\naverages of the results reported from the City’s latest quarterly sampling from tap LINL and tap\n3230, respectively. The difference between these results is not relevant since the reported\nconcentrations from the City and from HSA’s sampling event are still less than the MCL. It is\nnoted that the concentration of TTHMs reported from the City’s annual compliance event\n(collected at the Treatment Plant) is close to the MCL. This is not unexpected as the sampling\nlocation (treatment plant laboratory tap) is much closer to the point of disinfection than the\ndistribution system sampling taps.

This results in brief incidences of potable water product with a\nnotable change in the taste and higher concentrations of DBPRs. Concentrations of DBPRs\nand the stronger taste of chlorine subside with the inevitable reduction of chlorination.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAs a measure of the quality of the drinking water product being delivered to the Town by the\nCity, results from HSA’s November 2008 collection of potable water from the northern-most\nand southern-most distribution system sampling taps revealed target regulated drinking water\nparameters at concentrations below the MCL standards established in FDEP rule 62-770,\nF.A.C.\n\nA comparative of the results obtained from HSA’s sampling event to the City’s reported annual\nand quarterly results from 2008 monitoring events found minor variations in reported\nconcentrations for select parameters (see Table 1). These variations pose no concern for the\nquality of the potable water product being delivered to the Town since all parameter\nconcentrations reported from the City’s monitoring events and by HSA’s sampling event are\nless than respective MCLs.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016687\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

They monitored the comings and goings of its owner’s\nprivate jet, subpoenaed his phone records and riffled through his trash.\n\nThe owner was Jeffrey Epstein, 53, an intensely private New York money manager with\nseveral billionaire clients. Months earlier, the stepmother of a 14-year-old girl told the\nPalm Beach police that a wealthy older man, whom the girl later identified as Mr.\nEpstein, might have had inappropriate sexual contact with her.\n\nIn sworn statements to the police, the 14-year-old and other teenage girls said a friend\nhad arranged for them to visit Mr. Epstein’s home and give him massages, usually in\ntheir underwear, in exchange for cash.\n\nMost of the girls, according to the police, said Mr. Epstein had masturbated during the\nmassages, and a few said he had penetrated them with his fingers or penis. They\nidentified him in photos and accurately described the inside of his home. Some recalled\nthat his employees had fed them snacks or rented them cars.\n\nMr. Epstein pleaded not guilty in August to the crime he was ultimately charged with,\nsoliciting prostitution. But at a time when prosecutors around the nation have become\nincreasingly severe in dealing with people accused of sex offenses, the case has raised\nquestions about whether Mr. Epstein’s prominence won him preferential treatment.\n\nBy the account of the police, they found probable cause to charge Mr. Epstein with much\nmore serious offenses: one count of lewd and lascivious molestation and four counts of\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor.\n\nBut instead of proceeding with such charges on his own, the Palm Beach County state\nattorney took the rare step of presenting a broad range of possible charges to a grand jury,\nwhich indicted Mr. Epstein in July on the lesser count. In Florida, prosecutors usually\nrefer only capital cases to grand juries.\n\nEven before the indictment, the Palm Beach police chief, Michael Reiter, had accused\nprosecutors of giving Mr. Epstein special treatment and asked the state attorney, Barry E.\nKrischer, to remove himself from the case.\n\nIn an editorial, The Palm Beach Post attacked Mr. Krischer, a Democrat whose post is\nelective, saying the public had been left “to wonder whether the system tilted in favor of\na wealthy, well-connected alleged perpetrator and against very young girls who are\nalleged victims of sex crimes.”\n\nThe case has taken a toll on the reputation of Mr. Epstein, who owns a palatial home in\nManhattan, has pledged $30 million to Harvard and once flew former President Bill\nClinton on his 727. Politicians including Eliot Spitzer, a Democratic candidate for\ngovernor in New York, and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, also a Democrat, have\nreturned campaign contributions from him.\n\nBut Mr. Epstein fought back, assembling a team of star lawyers, including Gerald B.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021802\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Naturally, local women don't get multiple spouses, and the social\npenalties for infidelity are much worse for women. In America, feminists often point out\nthat \"slut\" is an insult while \"stud\" is a compliment; there's a similar linguistic trend in\nsiZulu, but the English words are mild compared to their siZulu equivalents.\n\nte Kk ok\n\nI rarely practice consensual non-monogamy myself, but I don't hesitate to advocate\ndestigmatizing polyamory and swing in America. True, my primary interest is BDSM,\nbut there's so much to learn from every form of consensual sexuality. Plus, we're\nbasically on the same side -- it'd be great if different sex subcultures had more\nconsciousness of a sex-positive \"agenda\" or \"movement\"! Although our communities\nhave different emphases and, sometimes, profoundly different values, I see swingers and\npolyfolk as my brothers- and sisters-in-arms.\n\nBut enough of the soapbox! The point is that I've often defended poly -- and I've gotten\ninto interesting arguments doing so. One friend noted just how hard it is for poly people\nto negotiate their relationships. \"It's so complicated,” he complained. \"So much\ncommunication is required. Doesn't that seem like an argument against it? If polyamory\nwere really a good relationship model, then people wouldn't have to put so much effort\ninto accomplishing it.”\n\n\"It's only complicated because polyamory isn't our societal default,\" I replied. \"People\nhave to put extra effort into negotiating relationships that fall outside the norm. The same\nthing happens with BDSM. Kinksters must spend a lot more time discussing our sexual\nrelationships, because it's more dangerous for us to make assumptions about where our\npartners want to go. That doesn't mean there's anything wrong with kink.\n\n\"And,\" I added, \"that extra effort can be a feature, not a bug! The fact that kinksters spend\nso much time isolating different aspects of our sexuality has given us a uniquely fine-\ngrained sexual vocabulary. I think most kinksters tend to make fewer assumptions about\nour partners' boundaries than vanilla people do. And circumstances have forced us to\ndevelop some brilliant strategies for bedroom communication. I'm not saying we're all\nbrilliant communicators, but I think we've got a unique window on it. When I run sexual\ncommunication workshops, half the tactics I share are filched from the BDSM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018585\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

A substantial part of the policy of reconciliation between Obama and Raul Castro\ndepends on the lifting of the embargo. Although there is great pressure from the White\nHouse, and surveys showing that the majority of Americans want the sanctions to end,\nthere are no guarantees that this will be achieved during this presidency. Neither can\none predict what will happen with the relations between the two countries if the next\nelections are won by a Republican candidate. Two of the most prominent ones, Jeb\nBush and Marco Rubio, have criticized President Obama for his new Cuban policy.\n\n2. The repeal of the 1996 Helms-Burton is one of the key requirements for Cuba to be able\nto approach the IDB, the IMF, or the World Bank. Without that credit, which requires\nCuba’s affiliation with these organizations, the Island will have no access to loans to\nrebuild the costly infrastructure that the country needs. It’s a very slow process that will\ntake a great deal of time.\n\n3. Cuba depends in large measures on subsidies from Venezuela, and Chavism is going\nthrough a very bad time, which could end up in its destruction and substitution with a\ngovernment unfavorable to “the Cubans.” The disappearance of Chavism in Venezuela\nwould be an economic and political catastrophe for Cuba. Today the popularity of\nNicolas Maduro is less than 20%.\n\n4. The political stability of the Cuban regime until now has depended on control by Fidel\nand Raul Castro. Fidel just turned 89, and Raul will be 84 in June. With them the\ngeneration of the revolution will come to an end, giving way to younger people, led by\nRaul Castro’s chosen heir, Engineer Miguel Diaz-Canel, who is 55. What’s going to\nhappen then? Could the regime transmit the authority within the Community single-\nparty model without the old leaders who until now have lent shape and sense to the\ngovernment. Will there arise other candidates with uncontrollable ambitions,\npresumably young military men, with the intention of taking command? Nobody knows.\nNevertheless, Cuban history has been bloody when regimes reach their end. They are\nreplaced by violence.\n\n5: It will be very risky to invest in properties confiscated from their legitimate owners\nduring the first years of the revolution. In both the United States and Spain there are\norganizations of those injured who are willing to go to court in defense of their rights,\nand who have hired lawyers to do just that. Originally the victims of the confiscations\nwere North Americans or Spaniards, but over time Cuban-Americans and Hispano-\nCubans have been added. Both the United States Congress and Senate and the Spanish\nParliament have legislators with these origins.\n\n6. What will probably happen will be something similar to the case of Nicaragua.\nNicaraguan exiles, infinitely fewer in number and power than the Cuban-Americans,\nwithout congressmen in Washington with their origins, managed to condition American\naid to the solution of the confiscations they had suffered during the first decade of the\nSandinista government. What’s predictable is that the injured Americans, together with\nthe Cuban-Americans, will manage to halt any American aid or benefit destined for Cuba\nuntil their property is returned to them or they are compensated for them.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025098\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Everyone I spoke to pointed their fingers in the same\ndirection and the worst place possible, Ritchie’s house. One of his best\nfriends told me of how bad he was doing, “He’s not the same guy\nanymore, and all he cares about is the next high he gets. If we don’t get\nanything for him he just loses it and goes off somewhere.” It was hard to\nhear how badly affected my best friend was and a part of me secretly\nhoped they weren’t right. Still defending him, I told everyone I had spoke\ntoo while trying to find him that T.J would be fine, he’s just probably\ngoing through a bad phase, like we all do sometimes and needs people to\nhave his back more than ever now. I was pretty much laughed at on the\nspot, most people that I considered my friends at the time were only\nfriends by association. As long as we all looked the part, acted the part,\nand could handle the part, only then did they want to be around us. The\nlast person I called was the last person I had hoped he wasn’t with and it\nturned out that everyone was right.\n\nHe was with one of the biggest Coke dealers in our area, Ritchie-Rich,\nas everyone used to call him. He didn’t look like a typical strung out\njunkie or dealer. Instead he looked like your average preppy college grad\nwith aspiring propositions. He dressed well and acted like a nice guy to\nimminent clients only to get them hooked on his drugs and then tums\nthem out onto the streets. He was a businessman and his business was\nthriving. He carried everything from most drugs to guns and knives.\nHaving ears in all places made him a dangerous acquaintance.

Obtaining Ritchie’s number from one of T.J’s friends\nMarcus he asked me, “What do you want to call Ritchie for? Come over\nto my place and I can get you whatever you want” Marcus was a sleaze\nbag who would tirelessly continue to try to appeal to my lesser sense of\njudgment, never getting the hint or just not caring that I could never and\nwould never be interested in him. “No Thanks Marcus, can I just get the\nnumber please, it’s very important that I get ahold of TJ, ['m really\nworried about him.” I hated having to call this guy let alone have to ask\nhim for something. “Is this about the Adam bullshit? Cause if it is you\ncan let him know what a fucking bitch he is for not showing up to be\nthere for him, you can tell him from me that it’s his fault and it should’ve\nbeen him that’s lying in the morgue now, not Adam” I was totally thrown\n\n99\n\nL Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004232\n\nby his allegations I could only mutter out a whisper “Did you just say that\nAdam is dead, what happened?” “Oh snaps, | thought you knew, where\nhave you been girl, under a rock or something?” Marcus was less than\nsensitive about his statements. “He got shot in the head by two black guys\nwho got suspicious when their usual supplier didn’t show up, your boy\nT.J was so fucked up he didn’t even remember to turn up at Ritchie’s for\nthe delivery, so Ritchie sent Adam alone and now he’s dead.” Adam was\na sweet kid who just happened to be born living on the wrong block. Best\nfriends with T.J since childhood, the two were inseparable until puberty\nhit and even then they would chase girls together. Adam followed in TJ's\nevery footstep, mimicking his shadow, if T.J jumped off the Eifel Tower\nthen so would Adam so when T.J got hooked on drugs consequently\nAdam did too, leading ultimately to his death. Wanting to end the\nconversation with Marcus quickly I scribbled down the phone number on\na blank piece of paper in front of me and hung up the phone to call\nRitchie’s place immediately.\n\n“Yeah?” It was Ritchie whom bluntly answered the phone after the first\nring. “Hi -Uh- Rich, It’s Jenna, T.J’s ex, we met a couple of times at a\nfew parties” I was trying to remind him of who | was knowing how\nparanoid he was about people having his number. “Oh yeah, I know who\nyou are, what is it you want?” He answered with a dry tone. “ | was\nhoping you could tell me where I could find T.J, Pve heard some stuff\nand am really worried about him, is he alright?” Ritchie snickered at my\nconcerns. “What are you his Mom or something? He’s fine, he should be\nback here around five o’clock, I'l! tell him you called.” In the middle of\nme saying “Thanks and good-bye” he hung up the phone, as there is no\nroom for manners in his line of work. | waited until five o’clock watching\nthe minutes on the clock tick past and when five o’clock came and passed\nby with still no phone call, I couldn’t deny to myself that I wasn’t\nstricken with distress.

Fear itself is quite fear-\n\ninducing. Most intelligent people in the world dress it up as something else: optimistic denial. Most who\navoid quitting their jobs entertain the thought that their course will improve with time or increases in\nincome. This seems valid and is a tempting hallucination when a job is boring or uninspiring instead of\npure hell. Pure hell forces action, but anything less can be endured with enough clever rationalization.\n\nDo you really think it will improve or is it wishful thinking and an excuse for inaction? If you were\nconfident in improvement, would you really be questioning things so? Generally not. This is fear of the\nunknown disguised as optimism.\n\nAre you better off than you were one year ago, one month ago, or one week ago?\n\nIf not, things will not improve by themselves. If you are kidding yourself, it is time to stop and plan\nfor a jump. Barring any James Dean ending, your life is going to be LONG. Nine to five for your\nworking lifetime of 40-50 years is a long-ass time if the rescue doesn’t come. About 500 months of solid\nwork.\n\nHow many do you have to go?

The\nluxury I advocate has nothing to do with money. It cannot be bought.

There are hundreds of cars circling a parking lot, and someone pulls out\n\nof a spot 10 feet from the entrance just as you reach his or her bumper. Another Christmas miracle!\n\nOther times, the timing could be better. The phone rings during sex and seems to ring for a half hour.\nThe UPS guy shows up 10 minutes later. Bad timing can spoil the fun.\n\nJean-Marc Hachey landed in West Africa as a volunteer, with high hopes of lending a helping hand. In\nthat sense, his timing was great.

That was the program. The more your supporters loved you, the more your\nantagonists hated you. That’s how it was supposed to work. And that’s how it was\nworking.\n\nBut Trump himself was desperately wounded by his treatment in the mainstream\nmedia. He obsessed on every slight until it was overtaken by the next slight. Slights were\nsingled out and replayed again and again, his mood worsening with each replay (he was\nalways rerunning the DVR). Much of the president’s daily conversation was a repetitive\nrundown of what various anchors and hosts had said about him. And he was upset not only\nwhen he was attacked, but when the people around him were attacked. But he did not\ncredit their loyalty, or blame himself or the nature of liberal media for the indignities\nheaped on his staffers; he blamed them and their inability to get good press.\n\nMainstream media’s self-righteousness and contempt for Trump helped provide a\ntsunami of clicks for right-wing media. But an often raging, self-pitying, tormented\npresident had not gotten this memo, or had failed to comprehend it. He was looking for\nmedia love everywhere. In this, Trump quite profoundly seemed unable to distinguish\nbetween his political advantage and his personal needs—he thought emotionally, not\nstrategically.\n\nThe great value of being president, in his view, was that you’re the most famous man in\nthe world, and fame is always venerated and adored by the media. Isn’t it? But,\nconfusingly, Trump was president in large part because of his particular talent, conscious\nor reflexive, to alienate the media, which then turned him into a figure reviled by the\nmedia. This was not a dialectical space that was comfortable for an insecure man.\n\n“For Trump,” noted Ailes, “the media represented power, much more so than politics,\nand he wanted the attention and respect of its most powerful men. Donald and I were\nreally quite good friends for more than 25 years, but he would have preferred to be friends\nwith Murdoch, who thought he was a moron—at least until he became president.”\n\nOOK Ok\n\nThe White House Correspondents’ Dinner was set for April 29, the one hundredth day of\nthe Trump administration. The annual dinner, once an insiders’ event, had become an\nopportunity for media organizations to promote themselves by recruiting celebrities—\nmost of whom had nothing to do with journalism or politics—to sit at their tables. This\nhad resulted in a notable Trump humiliation when, in 2011, Barack Obama singled out\nTrump for particular mockery. In Trump lore, this was the insult that pushed him to make\nthe 2016 run.\n\nNot long after the Trump team’s arrival in the White House, the Correspondents’\nDinner became a cause for worry. On a winter afternoon in Kellyanne Conway’s upstairs\nWest Wing office, Conway and Hope Hicks engaged in a pained discussion about what to\ndo.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020032\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I couldn’t help wondering\nwhether, despite our nearly daily exercises, and my nightly stock-taking, I'd\nsomehow missed an obvious detail in our planning. When we got back to the\nsayeret base, Avraham was waiting for us. “Well?” he asked Meir. “They don’t\nneed me,” he said. “They know what they’re doing.” It was not just a source of\nreassurance for me, but a huge relief for Avraham.\n\nThe team I’d inherited from Tubul included three gifted soldiers with\ndifferent backgrounds, and different skills. Motti Nagar was born in Cairo. He\nwas short but solidly built, smart, level-headed and almost always smiling. Kuti\nSharabi grew up in a Yemeni family in an impoverished neighborhood in Tel\nAviv. He had a self-deprecating sense of humor, a quick mind and sometimes\neven quicker tongue, but an extraordinary ability to focus on the task at hand.\nThe third member was a kibbutznik. His name was Moshe Elimelech. We called\nhim Moshiko. Utterly self-contained, a man who spoke only when absolutely\nnecessary, he also brought two different qualities to the mission. One was going\nto be indispensable: an almost squirrel-like ability to climb trees. Or telephone\npoles. The other, of which I was a bit more leery, was a total, deeply irrational,\nabsence of fear.\n\nThough none of us needed a further reminder of the weight being attached to\nour mission, the night before we headed north, Avraham got a call from the\nchief-of- staff's office. Tzvi Tzur wanted to see me the next morning for a\npersonal briefing. I tried to get Avraham to say no. I pointed out that if we\ndidn’t get going by ten o’clock at the latest, we’d risk throwing everything off\nschedule. But “no” was not an option. After some further back-and-forth, it was\nagreed that I would meet the commander of Israel’s armed forces at nine the\nnext morning at a gas station north of Tel Aviv and join him for the 20-minute\ndrive along the coastal road to a speaking engagement he had in Netanya.\n\nI saw Avraham again before I set off. “We are beginning an extremely\ncritical 24 hours for our unit, the intelligence corps, in fact for the armed forces\nas a whole,” he told me. “I don’t know what might happen. No one does. Just\nremember two things. First, out there, in the field, you are the ramatkal” — the\nchief of staff. He told me that only I and my team could judge and respond to\nwhat we encountered once the operation started. “And second, this mission has\nto be accomplished.”\n\nI left see the real ramatkal. Before we began the drive to Netanya, he asked\nme to unfold the map I'd brought with me and talk him through, step by step,\nhow we planned to get onto the Golan, plant the bugging device, and get back\n\n66\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011537\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I also don't see why we should ridicule religious dogma, just as I don't think we \nshould ridicule the much more pernicious secular dogmas. Rather, we should respond to irrational belief with \nargument and evidence, while recognizing that their advocates (like most of the intellectual world in the case of secular \ndogma) are people who we should be responding to but without ridiculing them. It may be hard sometimes. For \nexample, when the icon and founding father of sober non-sentimental Realism in International Affairs informs us that \nthe US, unlike other countries, has a \"transcendental purpose,\" and the fact that it constantly acts in contradiction to \nits purpose doesn't matter because the facts are just \"abuse of history\" while real history is \"the evidence of history as \nour minds reflect it,\" then it's hard to avoid ridicule.

The message,\nin other words, does not adequately convey the stakes of the game.\n\nWiener primarily warned of the social risks—trisks stemming from careless\nintegration of machine-generated decisions with governance processes and misuse (by\nhumans) of such automated decision making. Likewise, the current “serious” debate\nabout AI risks focuses mostly on things like technological unemployment or biases in\nmachine learning. While such discussions can be valuable and address pressing short-\nterm problems, they are also stunningly parochial. I’m reminded of Yudkowsky’s quip in\na blog post: “[A]sking about the effect of machine superintelligence on the conventional\nhuman labor market is like asking how US—Chinese trade patterns would be affected by\nthe Moon crashing into the Earth. There would indeed be effects, but you’d be missing\nthe point.”\n\nIn my view, the central point of the AI risk is that superintelligent AI is an\nenvironmental risk. Allow me to explain.\n\nIn his “Parable of the Sentient Puddle,” Douglas Adams describes a puddle that\nwakes up in the morning and finds himself in a hole that fits him “staggeringly well.”\nFrom that observation, the puddle concludes that the world must have been made for him.\nTherefore, writes Adams, “the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise.” To\nassume that AI risks are limited to adverse social developments is to make a similar\nmistake. The harsh reality is that the universe was not made for us; instead, we are fine-\ntuned by evolution to a very narrow range of environmental parameters. For instance, we\nneed the atmosphere at ground level to be roughly at room temperature, at about 100 kPa\npressure, and have a sufficient concentration of oxygen. Any disturbance, even\ntemporary, of this precarious equilibrium and we die in a matter of minutes.\n\nSilicon-based intelligence does not share such concerns about the environment.\nThat’s why it’s much cheaper to explore space using machine probes rather than “cans of\nmeat.” Moreover, Earth’s current environment is almost certainly suboptimal for what a\nsuperintelligent AI will greatly care about: efficient computation. Hence we might find\nour planet suddenly going from anthropogenic global warming to machinogenic global\ncooling. One big challenge that AI safety research needs to deal with is how to constrain\na potentially superintelligent AI—an AI with a much larger footprint than our own—from\nrendering our environment uninhabitable for biological life-forms.\n\nInterestingly, given that the most potent sources both of AI research and AlI-risk\ndismissals are under big corporate umbrellas, if you squint hard enough the “AI as an\nenvironmental risk” message looks like the chronic concern about corporations skirting\ntheir environmental responsibilities.\n\nConversely, the worry about AI’s social effects also misses most of the upside.\nIt’s hard to overemphasize how tiny and parochial the future of our planet is, compared\nwith the full potential of humanity.

Moreover, the complex pattern of these connections is very\nmeaningful. (See our next point.) Computer units typically make only a handful\nof connections, in regular, fixed patterns.\n\ne Development (self-assembly with interactive sculpting): The human brain grows\nits units by cell divisions and orchestrates them into coherent structures by\nmovement and folding. It also proliferates an abundance of connections among\nthe cells. An important part of its sculpting occurs through active processes\nduring infancy and childhood, as the individual interacts with his or her\nenvironment. In this process, many connections are winnowed away, while others\nare strengthened, depending on their effectiveness in use. Thus, the fine structure\nof the brain is tuned through interaction with the external world—a rich source of\ninformation and feedback!\n\ne /ntegration (sensors and actuators): The human brain comes equipped with a\nvariety of sensory organs, notably including its outgrowth eyes, and with versatile\nactuators, including hands that build, legs that walk, and mouths that speak.\nThose sensors and actuators are seamlessy integrated into the brain’s information-\nprocessing centers, having been honed over millions of years of natural selection.\nWe interpret their raw signals and control their large-scale actions with minimal\nconscious attention. The flip side is that we don’t know how we do it, and the\nimplementation is opaque. It’s proving surprisingly difficult to reach human\nstandards on these “routine” input-output functions.\n\nThese advantages of human brains over currently engineered artifacts are\nprofound. Human brains supply an inspiring existence proof, showing us several ways\nwe can get more out of matter. When, if ever, will our engineering catch up?\n\nI don’t know for sure, but let me offer some informed opinions. The challenges\nof three-dimensionality and, to a lesser extent, self-repair don’t look overwhelming.\n\nThey present some tough engineering problems, but many incremental improvements are\neasy to imagine, and there are clear paths forward. And while the powers of human eyes,\nhands, and other sensory organs and actuators are wonderfully effective, their abilities are\nfar from exhausting any physical limits. Optical systems can take pictures with higher\nresolution in space, time, and color, and in more regions of the electromagnetic spectrum;\nrobots can move faster and be stronger; and so forth. In these domains, the components\nnecessary for superhuman performance, along many axes, are already available. The\nbottleneck is getting information into and out of them, rapidly, in the language of the\ninformation-processing units.\n\nAnd this brings us to the remaining, and I think most profound, advantages of\nbrains over artificial devices, which stem from their connectivity and interactive\ndevelopment. Those two advantages are synergistic, since it is interactive development\nthat sculpts the massively wired but sprawling structure of the infant brain, enabled by\nexponential growth of neurons and synapses, to get tuned into the extraordinary\ninstrument it becomes. Computer scientists are beginning to discover the power of the\nbrain’s architecture: Neural nets, whose basic design, as their name suggests, was directly\ninspired by the brain’s, have scored some spectacular successes in game playing and\npattern recognition, as noted. But present-day engineering has nothing comparable—in\n\n60\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016863\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Trump was soon, and obviously,\ndistracted, and as the lecture continued he began sulking.\n\n“That guy bores the shit out of me,” announced Trump after McMaster left the room.\nBut Kushner pushed him to take another meeting with McMaster, who the next day\nshowed up without his uniform and in a baggy suit.\n\n“He looks like a beer salesman,” Trump said, announcing that he would hire McMaster\nbut didn’t want to have another meeting with him.\n\nShortly after his appointment, McMaster appeared on Morning Joe. Trump saw the\nshow and noted admiringly, “The guy sure gets good press.”\n\nThe president decided he had made a good hire.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nBy midmorning on April 4, a full briefing had been assembled at the White House for the\npresident about the chemical attacks. Along with his daughter and Powell, most members\nof the president’s inner national security circle saw the bombing of Khan Sheikhoun as a\nstraightforward opportunity to register an absolute moral objection. The circumstance was\nunequivocal: Bashar al-Assad’s government, once again defying international law, had\nused chemical weapons. There was video documenting the attack and substantial\nagreement among intelligence agencies about Assad’s responsibility. The politics were\nright: Barack Obama failed to act when confronted with a Syrian chemical attack, and now\nTrump could. The downside was small; it would be a contained response. And it had the\nadded advantage of seeming to stand up to the Russians, Assad’s effective partners in\nSyria, which would score a political point at home.\n\nBannon, at perhaps his lowest moment of influence in the White House—many still\nfelt that his departure was imminent—was the only voice arguing against a military\nresponse. It was a purist’s rationale: keep the United States out of intractable problems,\nand certainly don’t increase our involvement in them. He was holding the line against the\nrising business-as-usual faction, making decisions based on the same set of assumptions,\nBannon believed, that had resulted in the Middle East quagmire. It was time to break the\nstandard-response pattern of behavior, represented by the Jarvanka-Powell-Cohn-\nMcMaster alliance. Forget normal—in fact, to Bannon, normal was precisely the problem.\n\nThe president had already agreed to McMaster’s demand that Bannon be removed from\nthe National Security Council, though the change wouldn’t be announced until the\nfollowing day. But Trump was also drawn to Bannon’s strategic view: Why do anything, if\nyou don’t have to? Or, why would you do something that doesn’t actually get you\nanything? Since taking office, the president had been developing an intuitive national\nsecurity view: keep as many despots who might otherwise screw you as happy as possible.\nA self-styled strongman, he was also a fundamental appeaser. In this instance, then, why\ncross the Russians?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020026\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Attending various dinner parties, mostly with\nother esteemed billionaires and widely acclaimed scientists. Jeffrey likes\nto surround himself with the most brilliant and powerful of minds, filling\nhis little black book with some of the most esteemed and even infamous\npeople in today’s wealthy society. It was during those intellectual\ngatherings that my body was also put on the banquet menu but this time\nfor a powerful senator George Mitchell and another prominent Nobel-\nPrize winning scientist who’s name would be mentioned but for all the\nlife of me can no longer remember. They would be only some of the\nrecognizable figures of the high society that became added to my list of\nclientele, of course being introduced to for a lot more than just a client of\nmassage.\n\nAs an amusement to Jeffrey’s associates I also knew my place was to\nentertain but not to every desired content. I was to show them a good time\nbut not the way I would have to use technique and effort for Jeffrey. The\nvery teachings from Jeffrey himself, or my tutor, as he liked to so\neloquently put it. Consistently being used and adored for the likeliness of\nmy youthful looks I was becoming very accustomed to my lifestyle with\nJeffrey, never really relaxing into it, but just accepting this as being as\ngood as it will ever get for me. 1 didn’t think J should be complaining,\nwasn't I being offered a life in exchange for servitude? Just letting the\nsigns of my anxiety and depression pass me by while I blanketed them\nwith my pills, suffocating under a blanket of pain is all IT was really doing.\n\nI spent Christmas and the New Years holidays with Jeffrey in N.Y.C,\nwho doesn’t celebrate the occasion, as he is of Jewish descent. Not that\nhe was a religious man anyways, I never even saw him celebrate\nHanukah either. We firstly stayed at his ranch in Santa Fe for a week,\nthen left for a long plane trip to Paris, France where we all suffered jet lag\nfor the next twenty four hours. We all stayed in a grand hotel with a view\nthe Champs’ Elyse.\n\nEmmy and | shared a room and with her gifted ability to make new\ncontacts in just a few hours, she brought out a jay to share on the rooftop\nat nighttime while we were overlooking the lit up Eiffel Tower. We never\ngot really close as buddies but we both knew what we were indebted to\nand felt each other’s sorrows. All four of us went out shopping at Chanel,\nD&G, Ralph Lauren, and many other little exclusive boutiques the\nfollowing afternoon. As a gift Jeffrey bought me a white terry clothed\ngoose feathered sofa and had it sent back to my apartment in Florida, and\nbought some new tapestries to have sent back to Santa Fe for his ranch.\n\n71\n\n(1 Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004204\n\nWe also visited his up and coming Paris apartment. It was a modern,\ntypical flat being refurbished, and we went to see how it was all looking.\nJeffrey liked to fuss about every detail and harass the builder’s about their\nwork, changing last minute details at a whim.\n\nDays and many croissants later we left for Spain feeling bloated and\nsleepy. We only stayed in Spain for the afternoon, going to see another\nastounding Moroccan castle for Jeffrey to replicate at one of his many\nmansions. It was only a short plane ride to Tangier, Africa for more\ncastles hopping. We arrived at the historic landmark and the only five star\nhotel in Tangier called E] Minzah in the village of Ville Nouvelle. The\ncity and outskirts were still very hostile at the time, females being warned\nto not walk the streets alone and not to leave the house after dark or be at\nrisk of being raped or worse.\n\nWhen we got to the room, it was oozing with every expected bit of\nextravagance that a luxurious historical palace should offer until I was\ngreeted with a pile of monkey poo in the very middle of my bed. Not a\nhappy camper I called Jeffrey, Ghislane and Emmy into my adjoining\nroom and they all had quite a good laugh at my expense. Within a\nmoments notice of a complaint call to the front desk and we had an\nattendant cleaning up my bed linen. The cleaner noticed the window was\nstill opened, he warned not to leave it ajar at nighttime just in case\nanother monkey wanted to make himself comfortable in my quarters.\n\nGhislane joked that maybe | should keep it open I might find a suitable\nhusband before I get any older. Always the instigator of a good joke but\nunable to take one herself she didn’t like when I poked back that it was\nmore in her recent taste of men, since she loved to brag about her\nrendezvous with her various lovers. Once she came back giddy as a\nschoolgirl with an explosion of news, with all the build up and excitement\nin her voice you’d think she was the next crown princess, but she had\ngiven George Clooney a blowjob in the bathroom at some random event,\nshe never let that one down.\n\nWe all went to explore the towns surrounding Moroccan castles and\nmeet their royalty that lived in them. Jeffrey’s personal interior designer’s\nmet us at the residences. They walked around hurriedly, scribbling notes\ninto their clipboards and whispering between themselves.

But, most likely, you did not follow my instruction.\nThis is a form of social self-censorship. I asked you to do something rather\ndifficult and embarrassing, but very creative and likely to enlighten you.\nSadly most people — I am no exception — tend to censor their creativity\nfor fear of embarrassment. Children, of course, do not sensor themselves\nas much as adults.\n\nNow you know how to be more creative. Find your inner child and\ndon't censor yourself too much!\n\nWhat Sparks Creativity\n\nAs an inventor, I’m often asked what makes me creative. How do I do it?\nThe answer is, I have no real process. After all, a process is mechanical\nand this entire book has been about exploring how creativity is a non-\nmechanical task. However, there are many things you can do to unleash\nyour creative potential.\n\nNew ideas are often sparked through linking disparate ideas. Expose\nyourself to as many ideas as you can, read widely, attend conferences,\nvisit customers.\n\nCreativity requires peace and quiet. I personally get up early every\nmorning. This gives me a good two hours of uninterrupted time every\nday. It’s also the part of the day when my brain works best. Others prefer\nto work late into the night.\n\nPressure, for me and for many people, is a great incentive. Tales of\nthe Polish Enigma code breakers, Douglas Adams’ writing deadlines and\nthe fear of impending death in shark attack stories all force people to\nthink in an accelerated way. This appears to help many people defeat the\nhuman tendency to prevaricate.\n\nOn the other hand avoid panic. While a level of pressure can help,\npanic is unproductive. There is a sweet spot between having enough time\nto get properly acquainted with a problem and an impending deadline\nto force the crystallization of ideas. This balance varies from person to\nperson and is something you need to test for yourself.\n\nYou need time off. Once you have a well thought out idea, you\nmay need to leave it alone for a while to allow your subconscious to\nwork. Time off does not need to be two weeks at the beach. Charles\nDarwin and Benjamin Britten used to go for long walks. You can walk in\nDarwin's footsteps at Down House in Kent.

The advent of deep learning—\nin which computers, in effect, teach themselves to be smarter by observing tons of data,\nhas given him pause, because this method lacks transparency.\n\nWhile recognizing the impressive achievements in deep learning by colleagues\nsuch as Michael Jordan and Geoffrey Hinton, he feels uncomfortable with this kind of\nopacity. He set out to understand the theoretical limitations of deep-learning systems\nand points out that basic barriers exist that will prevent them from achieving a human\nkind of intelligence, no matter what we do. Leveraging the computational benefits of\nBayesian networks, Judea realized that the combination of simple graphical models and\ndata could also be used to represent and infer cause-effect relationships. The\nsignificance of this discovery far transcends its roots in artificial intelligence. His latest\nbook explains causal thinking to the general public; you might say it is a primer on how\nto think even though human.\n\nJudea’s principled, mathematical approach to causality is a profound\ncontribution to the realm of ideas.

For example, the integrative diagram\ntakes LIDA as a model of working memory and reactive processing, but from the papers on\nLIDA it’s unclear whether the creators of LIDA construe it more broadly than that. The deep\nlearning community tends to believe that the architecture of current deep learning networks,\nin itself, is close to sufficient for human-level general intelligence — whereas the integrative\ndiagram appropriates the ideas from this community mainly for handling perception, action\nand language, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, in a more positive perspective, one could view the integrative diagram\nas consistent with LIDA, but merely providing much more detail on some of the boxes in the\nLIDA diagram (e.g. dealing with perception and long-term memory). And one could view the\nintegrative diagram as consistent with the deep learning paradigm — via viewing it, not as\na description of components to be explicitly implemented in an AGI system, but rather as a\ndescription of the key structures and processes that must emerge in deep learning network, based\non its engagement with the world, in order for it to achieve human-like general intelligence.\n\nOur own view, underlying the creation of the integrative diagram, is that different commu-\nnities of cognitive science researchers have focused on different aspects of intelligence, and have\nthus each created models that are more fully fleshed out in some aspects than others. But these\nvarious models all link together fairly cleanly, which is not surprising as they are all grounded\nin the same data regarding human intelligence. Many judgment calls must be made in fusing\nmultiple models in the way that the integrative diagram does, but we feel these can be made\nwithout violating the spirit of the component models. In assembling the integrative diagram, we\nhave made these judgment calls as best we can, but we’re well aware that different judgments\nwould also be feasible and defensible. Revisions are likely as time goes on, not only due to\nnew data about human intelligence but also to evolution of understanding regarding the best\napproach to model integration.\n\nAnother possible argument against the ideas presented here is that there’s nothing new — all\nthe ingredients presented have been given before elsewhere. To this our retort is to quote Pascal:\n\"Let no one say that I have said nothing new ... the arrangement of the subject is new.\" The\nvarious architecture diagrams incorporated into the integrative diagram are either extremely\nhigh level (Sloman’s diagram) or focus primarily on one aspect of intelligence, treating the\nothers very concisely by summarizing large networks of distinction structures and processes in\nsmall boxes. The integrative diagram seeks to cover all aspects of human-like intelligence at a\nroughly equal granularity — a different arrangement.\n\nThis kind of high-level diagramming exercise is not precise enough, nor dynamics-focused\nenough, to serve as a guide for creating human-level or more advanced AGI. But it can be a\nuseful tool for explaining and interpreting a concrete AGI design, such as CogPrime.\n\n5.3 An Architecture Diagram for Human-Like General Intelligence\n\nThe integrative diagram is presented here in a series of seven Figures.\n\nFigure 5.1 gives a high-level breakdown into components, based on Sloman’s high-level\ncognitive-architectural sketch [Slo01].

Would we relax, saying that it’s a problem that can be set\non one side for 50 years — people will then be richer, and it may turn out then that it’s\ngoing to miss the Earth anyway?

But even if they’re\nhonoured, this may not happen fast enough to prevent CO2 concentrations rising to\ndangerous levels.\n\nPoliticians seldom take a long-term view, and won't gain much resonance by\nadvocating unwelcome lifestyle changes now — when the benefits accrue mainly to\ndistant parts of the world, and are decades into the future.\n\nBut there’s one measures to mitigate climate change that genuinely seems a ‘win win’\nscenario.\n\nCLEANER ENERGY SOURCES\n\nIt’s that nations should accelerate R and D into all forms of low-carbon energy\ngeneration (renewables, , 4\"th generation nuclear, fusion, and the rest) . And into\nother technologies where parallel progress is crucial — especially storage (batteries,\ncompressed air, pumped storage, flywheels, etc) and smart grids. That’ why an\nencouraging outcome of Paris was an initiative called ‘Mission Innovation’. It was\nlaunched by President Obama and by the Indian Prime Minister Modi. And endorsed\nby 20 other nations. It’s a campaign to double publicly funded R and D into clean\nenergy by 2020. There’s been a parallel pledge by Bill Gates and other private\nphilanthropists.\n\nThis target is a modest one . Presently, only 2 percent of publicly funded R and D is\ndevoted to these challenges. Why shouldn’t the percentage be comparable to\nspending on medical or defence research?\n\nThe faster these ‘clean’ technologies advance, the sooner will their prices fall so they\nbecome affordable to developing countries - where more generating capacity will be\nneeded -- where the health of the poorest billions is jeopardized by smoky stoves\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026735\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Subfields such as\nlogical planning, robotics, and natural-language understanding are special cases of the\ngeneral paradigm. AI has incorporated probability theory to handle uncertainty, utility\ntheory to define objectives, and statistical learning to allow machines to adapt to new\ncircumstances. These developments have created strong connections to other disciplines\nthat build on similar concepts, including control theory, economics, operations research,\nand statistics.\n\nIn both the logical-planning and rational-agent views of AI, the machine’s\nobjective—whether in the form of a goal, a utility function, or a reward function (as in\nreinforcement learning)—1s specified exogenously. In Wiener’s words, this is “the\npurpose put into the machine.” Indeed, it has been one of the tenets of the field that AI\nsystems should be general-purpose—i.e., capable of accepting a purpose as input and\nthen achieving it—rather than special-purpose, with their goal implicit in their design.\nFor example, a self-driving car should accept a destination as input instead of having one\nfixed destination. However, some aspects of the car’s “driving purpose” are fixed, such\nas that it shouldn’t hit pedestrians. This is built directly into the car’s steering algorithms\nrather than being explicit: No self-driving car in existence today “knows” that pedestrians\nprefer not to be run over.\n\nPutting a purpose into a machine which optimizes its behavior according to clearly\ndefined algorithms seems an admirable approach to ensuring that the machine’s “conduct\nwill be carried out on principles acceptable to us!” But, as Wiener warns, we need to put\nin the right purpose. We might call this the King Midas problem: Midas got exactly what\nhe asked for—namely, that everything he touched would turn to gold—but too late he\ndiscovered the drawbacks of drinking liquid gold and eating solid gold. The technical\nterm for putting in the right purpose is value alignment. When it fails, we may\ninadvertently imbue machines with objectives counter to our own. Tasked with finding a\ncure for cancer as fast as possible, an AI system might elect to use the entire human\npopulation as guinea pigs for its experiments. Asked to de-acidify the oceans, it might\nuse up all the oxygen in the atmosphere as a side effect. This is a common characteristic\nof systems that optimize: Variables not included in the objective may be set to extreme\nvalues to help optimize that objective.\n\nUnfortunately, neither AI nor other disciplines (economics, statistics, control\ntheory, operations research) built around the optimization of objectives have much to say\nabout how to identify the purposes “we really desire.” Instead, they assume that\nobjectives are simply implanted into the machine. AI research, in its present form,\nstudies the ability to achieve objectives, not the design of those objectives.\n\nSteve Omohundro has pointed to a further difficulty, observing that intelligent\nentities must act to preserve their own existence. This tendency has nothing to do with a\nself-preservation instinct or any other biological notion; it’s just that an entity cannot\nachieve its objectives if it’s dead. According to Omohundro’s argument, a\nsuperintelligent machine that has an off-switch—which some, including Alan Turing\nhimself, in a 1951 talk on BBC Radio 3, have seen as our potential salvation—will take\nsteps to disable the switch in some way.! Thus we may face the prospect of\nsuperintelligent machines—their actions by definition unpredictable by us and their\n\n' Omohundro, “The Basic AI Drives,” in Proc.

I turn down most celebrity requests, and cases involving celebrity clients form a tiny\nfraction of my practice over the years, but the few that I do take garner far more publicity than do\nthe many cases involving unknown clients.\n\nIs there anything special about famous clients—celebrities? Should “high profile” cases be\nhandled differently from less visible controversies? These are questions I have pondered during\nmy career as a lawyer.\n\nMost people see celebrities at a distance — on the screen, stage, television, athletic field, or\nauditorium. They see them at their best — acting, posing, playing, speaking, being interviewed or\nparticipating in charitable causes.\n\nI see celebrities close up and at their worst. They come to me when they are in trouble, often\ndeep trouble. Their celebrity is no longer a shield protecting them from the ordinary tribulations\nthat befall most people on a daily basis. When they come to me, their celebrity has been turned\ninto a sword being wielded against them. Celebrities generally live by publicity. When they come\nto me, they are dying from the publicity and want privacy and anonymity. But they can’t have it,\nbecause the very celebrity that brought them fame and fortune now threatens to magnify their\nproblems.\n\nI have represented, advised and consulted with dozens of celebrities, ranging from Presidents and\nPrime Ministers to world famous athletes, actors, writers and financiers. Most have gotten into\ntrouble for one overarching reason: because they were willing to risk what they have limited\namounts of in order to obtain more of what they have unlimited amounts of.\n\nThis may sound self-defeating, if not bizarre—so let me explain. Celebrities share several\ncommon characteristics. They have more of something than ordinary people have: great athletes\nhave extraordinary physical skills; good actors have unusual thespian skills; successful politicians\nhave a special charisma; financiers have money and the ability to make more. These special\ncharacteristics generally give celebrities access to certain desiderata of life: lots of money and the\nthings money and fame buy, and the benefits that come with these commodities, such as access to\nnumerous sexual partners — if they choose to use their celebrity to obtain such access (and\nexcess!)\n\nMany of my celebrity clients, who have unlimited amounts of money or access to sex, have\nsacrificed what they have limited amounts of — freedom, career, time with loved ones, health — in\norder to obtain even more money or sex. Let me provide a few examples of such bizarre risk-\ntaking in cases that are a matter of public record.

Research shows bi-directional causality between neuropsychiatric disorders and sleep disorders.\nThis is a superb example of how fundamental science breakthroughs lead to clinical breakthroughs. This fact\nthat REM is associated with emotional memories is nicely consistent with the apparent psychotic nature of\ndreams, because in REM Sleep the frontal cortex is ‘down-regulated’ (and the frontal cortex is associated with\nrational planning, reflection, controlling impulses), while in REM Sleep the limbic system is “up-regulated”\n(and the limbic system is associated with emotions and feelings) — see Neuroimaging below. This is\n\nwhy dream states flood the ego with emotional fantasies without rational control. However, it is also true that\nthe limbic system enables creative ideas, thus grounding in science the long-suspected idea that sleep and\ndreams can enhance creativity.\n\nAs Dr. Robert Stickgold, our other advisor on the series, wrote: “It would be nice if we could talk about sleep\nand memory as if there were only one type of memory and one type of sleep. But this is far from the case.\nSleep and memory each comes in many forms, and furthermore, memories can go through multiple forms of\npost-encoding processing that must be individually addressed.”\n\nImmunity / Immune System. Strengthening the immune system is now a proven product of NREM sleep.\nDiscerning the evolutionary basis for this is a key research project (1.e., it seems counter-intuitive\n\nthat sleeping facilitates fitness for survival in that predators lurked in the jungles and on the plains so that\ngoing unconscious during sleep does not, at first glance, seem especially adaptive). Studies of sleep in various\nnon-human animals reveals a direct relationship between longer periods of NREM (Slow-Wave) Sleep and a\nstronger immune system, especially in fighting parasites. NREM Sleep releases molecules that\n\nfight inflection; NREM Sleep works for the maintenance, repair and activation of the immune system. (This\ngives scientific rationale for the need or desire to sleep during illnesses.) Related are “genetic conflict” studies\nwith respect to REM and NREM, showing differences in heredity between material and paternal lines, and\ndifferences between males and females in which genes get “imprinted”.\n\nNeuroplasticity. Exciting recent research has reversed the century-long conventional wisdom that new\nneurons are never created in adult animals/humans. The development of new neurons — neuronogenesis — is a\nvital part of maintaining normal brain and mental functioning. New neurons are being created, importantly, in\nthe hippocampus (brain organ where new memories are encoded) — but, remarkably, the neuronogensis in\n\nthe hippocampus occurs only/largely during REM Sleep — a stunning finding. This is another reason why\nREM sleep is needed for emotional memory consolidation (normal functioning).\n\nDream-Content. Although dreams have sparked human fascination and fantasy for thousands of years, only\nin very recent years, have large-scale surveys been conducted with rigorous design, classifications and\nstatistical analysis. Literally hundreds of thousands of dreams are enabling statistically significant theories,\nincluding cross-cultural analyses (similarities and differences). Dream-posting sites have revolutionized size\nand structure of dream data sets. This enables, for the first time, longitudinal studies of dreams over time.\nPatterns are repeated. For example, in general, the dreams of males and females differ in fundamental ways.\nMales will engage in fighting with other males; females with both males and females. Male dreamers\n\nare often the initiator of fights and the fights are usually physical. Females fight verbally. Aggressiveness\nby the dreamer is almost always in REM Sleep, rarely in NREM Sleep. (Why is a continuing question.)\n“Lucid Dreaming” is a new area of fascinating research. Lucid Dreaming is where the dreamer “knows” that\nhe/she is dreaming while dreaming (a talent that a small minority possesses but more can be\ntrained/developed). Lucid dreamers, while sleeping, can now communicate with experimenters by altering\ntheir brain activity and thus becoming detectable by neuroimaging techniques (see below).\n\nNeuroimaging. Finally, neuroimaging technology has enabled many of these breakthroughs. As such, it is\nitself a methodological breakthrough that has enabled these other content breakthroughs. Neuroimaging now\nenables detailed location of the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of REM and NREM Sleep. In\n\nREM Sleep, the dorsolateral, frontal cortex is “down-regulated”, whereas the limbic system is “up-regulated”,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025107\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

After reading the book I stopped talking about my dreams and immediately started setting\nshort-term and long-term goals. I bought a notebook to track my monthly goals and tasks. I did lots of\nresearch on potential remote working situations and I started telling my close friends and family about\nmy new plans. Everyone that I told thought it was just an idea and I wasn’t actually going to go through\nwith it. They thought it was a “some day I'd like to do this” idea and that I wasn’t actually setting daily\ngoals to get me there. They knew that I loved my job so why would I leave it for a life of uncertainty? I\ndidn’t think of it that way. I wasn’t scared, I was excited at the prospect of a new way of life, a fresh\nstart, and even though I loved my job I also had other things I wanted to accomplish in my life. At first I\nthought about teaching English to make a living down there, but deep down inside all I really wanted to\ndo was continue working for my current company, just doing it remotely. The book gave me the\nconfidence to think this was actually possible, when everyone around me thought it was impossible.\n\nI decided to write up a proposal and present it to my boss even at the advice not to do it from\neveryone I knew. If my boss rejected my proposal, I had enough money saved up to live in Argentina for\nat least six months to get me by until I could figure out how I wanted to make money there. I was not\ngiving up on my dream of living a freer, happier life with less work and more time for myself. All odds\nwere against me but I took a calculated risk and had faith in myself. After I handed in my proposal, I\nwas ready to expect the worst. Everyone around me was waiting with baited breath and words of\nencouragement after I got rejected. When I left the meeting with my boss I couldn’t believe it. She\naccepted and was eager to talk to me about the details. She even had a smile on her face and told me how\nawesome my proposal was. No one else could believe it when I told them. After the shock wore off, I\nrealized that I could actually do this, and a huge weight was lifted from my shoulders. The hardest part\nwas over and now I could start thinking of more possibilities for my new life.\n\nI set my goal to move to Argentina for September 2008. I arrived here on September 3 and have been\nhere for about six months now. I live in the capital city of Jujuy, Argentina, a small province in the\nnorthwest of Argentina. I work about 5—10 hours a week and [ find that I am much more focused now\nthat I am out of the office and working alone. I have a private Spanish tutor that I meet with for two\nhours, five days a week. I have a handful of friends that I spend time with, practicing my Spanish.

The idea, backed by Vice President\nAl Gore, was to reduce the size of the federal government by out-\nsourcing investigating the backgrounds of millions of government\napplicants for jobs. The task had previously been performed by the\nFBI, but it was assumed that a profit-making business could do it\nfaster and more efficiently. The private company named U.S. Inves-\ntigations Services was purchased in 2007 for $1.5 billion by Provi-\ndence Equity Partners, a rapidly expanding investment firm founded\nin 1989 by graduates of Duke, Brown University, and the Harvard\nBusiness School. So like Booz Allen, USIS was backed by a hedge\nfund determined to make money by systematically cutting the cost\nof a service previously carried out by the government.\n\nBut such outsourcing had drawbacks. For one thing, unlike the\nFBI, USIS lacked the investigative clout to gain entry to certain gov-\nernment agencies. A Congressional review found that the privacy\nact permits disclosure of government agency records to the private\n\n© firm if they are part of a “routine use of the records,” but intelligence ®\nagencies did not consider all such requests to be “routine. For exam-\nple, when it did the background check on Snowden in 2011, it could\nnot get access to his CIA file. The “derog” in his file might have set\noff alarm bells, as might the fear that he had been threatened by an\ninternal investigation over his alleged computer tampering in 2009.\nThe FBI might have learned this about Snowden if it had done his\nbackground check.\n\nThe lack of adequate oversight was another problem. USIS closed\ncases and cleared applicants without completing an adequate inves-\ntigation. According to a U.S. government suit filed in 2014, USIS\nhad prematurely closed over 665,000 investigations in order to get\npaid for them more quickly. Because the more cases it completed\neach month, the more money it received from the government, the\nlawsuit alleged that USIS employees often “flushed” or ended cases\nbefore completing a full investigation to meet corporate-imposed\nquotas for getting bonuses. One employee, in an e-mail cited in the\ngovernment’s complaint, said they “flushed everything like a dead\ngoldfish.” As a result, some information specialists entering the NSA\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r.indd 216 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019704\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

From two strongly supported hypotheses, we’ve\ndrawn a straightforward conclusion:\n\ne Human mind emerges from matter.\n\ne Matter is what physics says it is.\n\ne Therefore, the human mind emerges from physical processes we\nunderstand and can reproduce artificially.\n\ne Therefore, natural intelligence is a special case of artificial\nintelligence.\n\nOf course, our “astonishing corollary” could fail; the first two lines of this\nargument are hypotheses. But their failure would have to bring in a foundation-shattering\ndiscovery—a significant new phenomenon, with large-scale physical consequences,\nwhich takes place in unremarkable, well-studied physical circumstances (1.e., the\nmaterials, temperatures, and pressures inside human brains) yet which has somehow\nmanaged for many decades to elude determined investigators armed with sophisticated\ninstruments. Such a discovery would be. . . astonishing.\n\nID. The Future of Intelligence\n\nIt is part of human nature to improve on human bodies and minds. Historically, clothing,\neyeglasses, and watches are examples of increasingly sophisticated augmentations that\nenhance our toughness, perception, and awareness. They are major improvements to the\nnatural human endowment, whose familiarity should not blind us to their depth. Today\nsmartphones and the Internet are bringing the human drive toward augmentation into\nrealms more central to our identity as intelligent beings. They are giving us, in effect,\nquick access to a vast collective awareness and a vast collective memory.\n\nAt the same time, autonomous artificial intelligences have become world\nchampions in a wide variety of “cerebral” games, such as chess and Go, and have taken\nover many sophisticated pattern-recognition tasks, such as reconstructing what happened\nduring complex reactions at the Large Hadron Collider from a blizzard of emerging\nparticle tracks, to find new particles; or gathering clues from fuzzy X-ray, fMRI, and\nother types of images, to diagnose medical problems.\n\nWhere is this drive toward self-enhancement and innovation taking us? While the\nprecise sequence of events and the timescale over which they’ll play out is impossible to\npredict (or, at least, beyond me), some basic considerations suggest that eventually the\nmost powerful embodiments of mind will be quite different things from human brains as\nwe know them today.\n\nConsider six factors whereby information-processing technology exceeds human\ncapabilities—vastly, qualitatively, or both:\n\ne Speed: The orchestrated motion of electrons, which is the heart of modern\nartificial information-processing, can be much faster than the processes of\ndiffusion and chemical change by which brains operate. Typical modern\ncomputer clock rates approach 10 gigahertz, corresponding to 10 billion\noperations per second. No single measure of speed applies to the bewildering\nvariety of brain processes, but one fundamental limitation is latency of action\n\n58\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016278\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

If Clinton was prepared to pay $700,000 to settle a suit he regarded as utterly\nfrivolous and untrue, no greater incentive would have been added if he defaulted and paid.\n\nThe sad reality is that Robert Bennett, perhaps in his zeal to chalk up a high visibility win, failed\nor neglected to tell the president that this was one case that was better for the client to lose and\navoid testifying rather than to win and risk testifying falsely.\n\nDefaulting the Jones case would have resulted in bad headlines the next day—and perhaps for an\nadditional week. But testifying about his sex life resulted in a dangerous threat to the Clinton\npresidency — a threat which would not materialize for several months. Thus we see another\ninstance of the President making a decision which helped him in the short run — by avoiding the\nnegative headlines of a settlement or default — but hurt him greatly in the long run. It was a\npattern that would persist.\n\nOn January 26, 1998, President Clinton, with the assistance of Hollywood producer Harry\nThomason , decided to make a public statement denying a sexual relationship with Monica\nLewinsky. Pointing his finger at the TV camera for emphasis, he said:\n\n“T want you to listen to me. I’m going to say this again. I did not\n\nhave sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told\n\nanybody to lie, not a single time — never. These allegations are\n\nfalse. And I need to go back to work for the American People.”\n\nThis statement, made directly to the American public and not under oath, has come back to haunt\nClinton. Why did he make it? He was under no legal obligation to make any statement. He could\neasily have said, as so many others have said, “Since the matter is now the subject of a legal\nproceeding, my lawyers have advised me to make no public comment about it. I’m sure you\nunderstand.”\n\nBut instead, he issued a firm denial of what he would later have to admit was essentially true:\nnamely that he did, in fact, have some kind of a sexual encounter with “that woman.”\n\nOnce again, the President and his advisors opted for the quick fix. They felt that it was necessary\nto put out the political brushfire that was burning around them. By issuing a firm denial, the\nPresident could postpone — perhaps forever — the longer term consequences of his improper sex\nand his misleading testimony.

Body language allows us to convey qualitatively different things,\nsuch as trust and happiness.

It was\ngenerally holding.\n\nBut fundamentally, Arik’s war plan was not a response to the Katyushas. It\nwas a way of using military force to achieve Prime Minister Begin’s political\naim: stopping the Camp David peace process in its tracks, and ensuring it did\nnot go beyond the peace treaty with Egypt. And even that message was not\nprincipally intended for the Palestinians, I suspect, but for the Americans.\nIsrael’s Labor-led governments had always calculated that we needed at least\nsome measure of support from foreign allies, especially the US. Under Begin,\nwe'd already bombed Saddam Hussein’s nuclear reactor without telling the\nAmericans beforehand. Shortly after I returned to the kirya, he provoked further\nanger in Washington by announcing the de facto annexation of the Golan — in\neffect “balancing” our Sinai withdrawal with a dramatic reassertion of Israeli\ncontrol over other land captured in the 1967 war. Part of Arik’s plan in Lebanon\nwas to deliver an even more forceful riposte to any suggestion that we would\ngive up control of the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nYet these political aims, which I was gradually beginning to grasp in their\nfull form through my discussions with Arik, were only part of the reason I was\ndeeply uneasy about the plans for our Lebanon invasion. Having now spent\nnearly two decades in the military, I recognized that the security challenge north\nof the border was real. I did not believe it was inherently wrong for Begin’s\ngovernment to order a pre-emptive military operation with the aim of ending it.\nMy view, as an army officer, was that the decision on how, when and whether\nto go to war was for our elected government. But for that principle to work, I\nalso believed that government ministers had to know what they were deciding.\nThe more we geared up for an invasion, the less certain I became that Begin’s\ncabinet understood what we were planning to do.\n\nArik’s original plan was codenamed Oranim: Hebrew for “pine trees”. It\ninvolved pushing deep into Lebanon, all the way up to the strategically critical\nroad that ran between Beirut and Damascus. We would link up in Beirut with\nthe main Maronite Christian force, the Phalangists, whom we had been\nsupporting and training for several years. When that plan was presented to\nBegin’s cabinet at the end of 1981, however, most ministers opposed it. Thus\nwas born Arik’s Plan B, so-called “Little Pines”. Its stated aim was a lot more\nmodest. We would create a “security zone” — a 40-kilometer, or 25-mile, strip\nrunning north of the border with Lebanon.\n\n194\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028042\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

At week 24 in the same\ntrial, Praluent reduced LDL cholesterol by 43 percent compared to placebo. In this study, if additional LDL\ncholesterol lowering was required based on pre-specified criteria at week 8, Praluent was up-titrated to 150 mg\nat week 12 for the remainder of the trial. Eighty-three percent of patients remained on their initial 75 mg dose.\nPraluent is generally well-tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. Local injection site reactions including\nredness, itching, swelling or pain/tenderness where the injection is given were the most common events (7.2\npercent with Praluent versus 5.1 percent with placebo) and resulted in a low discontinuation rate that was\ncomparable to placebo (0.2 percent with Praluent versus 0.4 percent with placebo).

Then, after\nmonths of negotiations, the State reached what it believed was an appropriate resolution of the case.\nImportantly, this resolution was consistent with that of cases involving other defendants who had\nengaged in similar conduct. Implementation of the State resolution of the case was held in abeyance,\nhowever, due to the unexpected commencement of the successive federal criminal investigation.\n\nWhile it is true, as CEOS points out, (CEOS letter at p. 3) that many criminal prosecutions\nturn on issues of credibility of witnesses, to which many members of the defense team can attest\n(having had decades of federal criminal litigation experience among us), this does not serve to divest\nthe prosecutor of his/her duty to make a searching inquiry of the facts before using the power of\nprosecution, and the weight of the United States government, to level serious accusations. CEOS\nlikewise acknowledges as much, “the prosecutors are in the best position to assess the witnesses’\ncredibility.” (CEOS letter at p. 3).\n\nSince the CEOS letter also singles me out as someone who should be familiar with witness\nissues, I feel compelled to note that, of course, I am well aware that it is not uncommon for witnesses\nto give conflicting statements. Iam also fully aware that the credibility of key government witnesses\nmay be strongly impacted by the $50 million incentive provided via the civil lawsuits at play, and\nencouraged by the government here. ? I have also read many of the conflicts between witness\ntestimony and Detective ReCarey’s own rendition of that testimony in his reports and/or search\nwarrant affidavit. Detective ReCarey apparently formed a view early on as to the purported\ncriminality of Mr. Epstein’s conduct regardless of the mountain of evidence to the contrary. For a\nprosecutor that has had an opportunity to review the full facts, and to meet with the witnesses,\nhowever, “conflicting statements” cross the line to a “lack of credibility” that simply can not sustain\na prosecution. That is where an appropriate application of prosecutorial discretion must be brought\nto bear.\n\nAgain, CEOS was not itself in the position to exercise such discretion. By its own admission,\nCEOS did not make a full review of the witness statements here, and CEOS certainly did not sit\ndown across the table and speak to these witnesses. We understand that was apparently not its\nperceived role. But, CEOS should recognize that at least one prosecutor in this case — the Chief of\nthe SAO Sex Crimes Division has done so. Lana Belohlavek not only met with and interviewed\nthese witnesses during the course of the 15-month state investigation prior to any federal\ninvolvement, but she again sat across the table from many of them in connection with recent civil\n\n3 It is important to note here that this investigation was launched not upon the complaint of any alleged victim, but,\nrather, upon the complaint of (thcr, I, and her — —« More\nnotable still is the fact that [ME has been convicted of federal bank fraud, an has a state\n.

Jets belonging to TWA, Pan Am and Swissair were seized by the Popular Front\nfor the Liberation of Palestine. The group also attempted to hijack a jet over London belonging to the\nIsraeli airline El Al but was thwarted by security guards on board.\n\nThe Pan Am seizure ended quickly, but the passengers on the TWA and Swissair jets were diverted\nto a British air base in Jordan and the drama only ended after days of tense diplomacy, when the\nhostages were all released in a deal in which the Swiss, German, British and Israeli governments let\n\nPalestinian prisoners go.\" (http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/27/politics/terrorism-19 70s-richard-\nnixon/index.html)\n\nThis 9/11 response sounds quite normal of course.

The U.S. informed Secretary General Hammarskjold that it did not\nfavor any action by the UN to revise the present calendar. ‘Large numbers of the US\ncitizens oppose the plan,’ the U.S. note said. “Their opposition is based on religious\ngrounds...””\n\nWe were thrilled that our campaign—involving hundreds not quite the “large numbers”\nreported—had succeeded. We regarded it as a victory for religious freedom. It persuaded me\nthat even small efforts could have an impact on large organizations—a lesson that has stayed with\nme over my career. And it enhanced my admiration for the U.N., which had shown sensitivity to\nreligious minorities.\n\nDuring my high school years, my class made several visits to the U.N., where we watched the\nGeneral Assembly in action.

I\nmarched, attended rallies, trained for civil rights work in the South, and briefly traveled to points\nof confrontation in several southern cities, while carefully remaining out of harm’s way.\n\nAfter becoming a teacher and a lawyer, my involvement in the human rights movement\nbroadened, both academically and politically.\n\nIn my academic work, I began to explore the meaning of the term “human rights,” as contrasted\nwith “civil rights,” “civil liberties,” and “political rights.” To be an advocate of “human” rights\nmeant to me going beyond one’s particular group. A Jew who fights only against anti-Semitism is\nan advocate for particular rights, as is an African-American who struggles only against racism, a\nwoman who only opposes sexism, or a gay person who limits his advocacy to gay rights.

When I say “Mill’s idea”, from now on, | will mean some of both.\n\nNo one had the data to prove him right until national accounts began reporting\nmarket-valued capital in 1990 or so, and reconstructing it for a few decades before.\nWhat they had earlier was the book measures of capital that we see in balance\nsheets. They don’t reveal enough. Book measures assume depreciation norms.\nOutcomes converge to norms over time, but meanwhile might be anything. National\naccounts follow a form of this book or depreciation accounting. They now report\nmarket-valued capital too, but still prefer book methods to calculate investment I\nand output Y in the Y = C + I equation. That doesn’t work well.

In the boom year 1933, when stock\nmarkets were up 42%, 67%, 96% and 46% in those four countries, Germany and U.S.\nreported net investment (capital growth) as negative while France and U.K.\nreported it up less than half a percent. All this shows in my charts and tables.\nReports of net investment in national accounts tend to prove radically wrong in\nyears of unexpected upturn or downturn because they don’t get the news of wars or\nnational disasters or discoveries or business cycles until new assets are bought or\nnew products sold. Purchases and sales are normally the only input into the books.\nAverage time between original purchase and realization in sales is the “holding\nperiod” or “turnover period” of capital. For all physical capital together, it runs\nseveral years.

Our offices were along the\nsame hallway of the Airya, the ministry’s headquarters in the heart of Tel Aviv.\nRabin had a very low table in his office, with two chairs. We would sit across\nfrom each other, each with a ready supply of coffee and Yitzhak smoking an\napparently endless supply of cigarettes, and we would just talk. Politics.\nStrategy. Israel. The PLO. The surrounding Arab states. And the wider world.\n\nMany years before I became Prime Minister, I gave a lecture at a memorial\nmeeting for an Israeli academic. Not many people were there. I doubt even they\nremember it. But I do, because what I said has, sadly, become more prophetic\nthan even I could have imagined. I talked about the imperative for peace as part\nof Israel’s security. There was a “window,” I said. We were militarily strong. In\nregional terms, we were a superpower. But politically, resolving the conflict\nwith our Arab enemies would almost certainly become more difficult with time.\n\n9\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011480\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Yoram Ben-Porath combined these ideas and more in a masterly life-\n\ncycle model published in 1967. We'll get to it soon.\n\nSchultz called the part of consumption exhausted in taste satisfaction “pure\nconsumption”. The part invested in human capital was “pure investment”. I change\nthat to “invested consumption” to avoid confusion with investment in physical\ncapital. Since there is no settled term for the part of work invested in learning, | call\nit “self-invested work”. I call the part of work sold for pay “realized work”.

I agree,\nwith a clarification as to possible deadweight loss that I'll come to in Chapter 6. I call\nit the Ben-Porath equation, although he drew it from the Schultz-led consensus. It is\n\nreally a summary of the first four of the equations in his 1967 paper taken together.\n\nThis explains my critique of the Y=I+C equation. The equation would be true if\nhuman capital growth equaled invested consumption. In fact it equals that plus self-\ninvested work less human depreciation. The corrected equation would read “output\nequals consumption plus investment plus self-invested work less human\n\ndepreciation”. | call this the “Y rule”.\n\nUpending the Y =! + C equation is big news.

It doesn’t follow that national\naccounts in themselves need much change, aside from reporting net investment at\nmarket as well as at book, because accountants must measure what they can.\nHuman depreciation and self-invested work elude market measurement. But\neconomists can allow for them, and they are huge flows. Human depreciation is\ndepreciation of the larger factor. And self-invested work includes more than\nlearning. Ben-Porath showed, as we will see, that it equals all growth in human\n\ncapital not explained by inflows of nurture and schooling less outflows in human\n\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 12\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010952\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

They didn’t bother getting married until the summer of 1941. Perhaps\nbecause this was less than nine months before I was born, my mother always\nremained vague when asked their exact wedding date.\n\nMy parents were an unlikely pair. My mother — bright, lively and energetic —\nwas a doer, who believed passionately in the grand social experiment of kibbutz\nlife. Having helped her mother raise her siblings in Warsaw, and with a natural\naffinity from children, she became the main authority on issues related to\nchildbirth and early childcare. She actively partook in the kibbutz’s planning\nand politics, and reveled in its social life. My father was more detached both\npolitically and socially. He was more contemplative, less assertive, less self-\nconfident. Though he agreed broadly with the founding principles of the\nkibbutz, and wanted to play his role in making it a success, I could see, as I\ngrew older, that he was often impatient at what he saw as its intellectual\ninsularity and its ideological rigidities.\n\nThough it didn’t strike me at the time, he was not a large man. As a result of\nhis childhood illness, he never grew to more than five-foot-four. Still, he was a\npowerful presence, stocky and strong from his work on the kibbutz. He had a\ndeep, resonant voice and wise-looking, blue-gray eyes. It was only through\nUncle Meir that by the time I was born, he had moved on from driving a tractor\nto a more influential role on the kibbutz. Meir worked for the Palestine Electric\nCompany and when Mishmar Hasharon installed its own electricity system, the\nPEC was in charge of the work. Meir trained my father and put him forward as\nthe kibbutz contact for maintaining and repairing the equipment. He was well\nsuited for the work. He was a natural tinkerer, a problem-solver. He was good\nwith his hands, and his natural caution was an additional asset as the kibbutz got\nto grips with the potential, and the potential dangers, of electric power. Once the\nsystem was installed, he became responsible for managing any aspect of the\nsettlement that involved electricity: water pumps, the irrigation system, the\ncommunal laundry and our bakery.\n\nMy parents were courteous and polite with each other, but they never\nshowed any physical affection in our presence. None of the adults did. This was\npart of an unspoken kibbutz code. Not only for kibbutzniks, but for all the early\nZionists, outward displays of emotion were seen as a kind of selfishness that\nrisked undermining communal cohesion, tenacity and strength. Because I’d\nknown no other way, this did not strike me as odd. Besides, I was a quiet,\ncontemplative, bookish and self-contained child. Only in later years did I come to\nsee the lasting effect on me. It was be a long time before I became comfortable\n\n23\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011494\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Hunter 46\nThese gains are an extraordinary achievement for District 31\n\na school and its district. They are also difficult to\n\nmaintain over time, however this goal is shared Fifth Grade\n\nbetween the District and k12. The Hunter School\n\naccomplished these gains through the staff's hard Hunter 22\n\nwork, commitment to their students and —\n\ndedication to implementing the k12 program. District 15\n\nNew programs often take two to three years to generate similar results. While k12 and the Hunter staff\nare pleased with the first year’s results, it is only the beginning of a longer effort because, despite the\ngains, more than half of last year’s fifth graders still did not score at or above their grade level. Therefore,\nalthough there is pride in the progress, the overall scores demonstrate how much more is to be done.\n\n13.5. Direct to Consumer (3% of 2006E Revenue)\n\nk12 sells its curriculum direct to consumers who either home school their children or use k12’s curriculum\nto supplement their child’s education. k12 believes that it offers children and their parents an education\ncomparable to that offered in the nation’s best public and private schools, utilizing optimal multimedia\nmethods and research-tested approaches to learning. In addition, integrated assessments allow a parent\nto test his or her child’s mastery of skills and enables the child to progress at the appropriate pace.\nChildren can move faster through lessons and address more challenging problems, while other children\ncan spend the additional time needed to master certain skills. With k12’s high standards and integrated\nassessments, a parent can be confident that his or her child has mastered the subject. k12 considers this\nmarket a growth area.\n\nEducating a child at home full time or part time is a time-consuming and daunting task for parents.\nParents and caregivers spend a considerable amount of time searching for curriculum and trying to\nensure they are teaching the material adequately to their children. k12 offers a solution to this challenge\nby offering a comprehensive curriculum for students in grades K-9, complete with specific daily lessons.\nParents can purchase individual or multiple courses. Although small, the home-schooling market is\ngrowing at a healthy pace. Approximately 1.1 million students—roughly 2% of total K-12 enrollment—\nwere home-schooled in spring 2003, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).\nThis represents a roughly 30% increase from spring 1999. Most home school parents cited concerns\nabout the school environment (31%), interest in providing religious instruction (30%) and_ overall\ndissatisfaction with academic instruction (16%) as their reasons for home schooling their children.*°\n\nThe exam is also used in assessing performance toward No Child Left Behind guidelines for grades 3, 5, 9 and 11. The goal of the exam is for\nstudents to score at or above proficient levels. Student results are also used fo determine a school and district's performance in meeting pre-\ndetermined goals known as Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP).\n\n°° Source: Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005.\n\n110\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024543\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Marie Villafafia was the lead federal prosecutor in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case. The U.S. attorney’s office’s handling of\n\nthe prosecution, which led to a plea to minor charges in state court, has been harshly criticized.\n\nLater that year, Acosta and Villafafa put together a plea bargain for Epstein, a\nmultimillionaire money manager who sexually abused nearly three dozen teenage\ngirls at his mansion in Palm Beach. The deal, a federal judge ruled last month, was\nintentionally kept from his victims in violation of the Crime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nWhile the two cases are unrelated, it shows that both Acosta and Villafana had been\nwarned about the importance of victim disclosure in sex crimes cases before the\nEpstein agreement. They nevertheless forged ahead with a pact with Epstein that\nviolated the law.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Kenneth A. Marra wrote: “When the Government gives\ninformation to victims, it cannot be misleading. While the Government spent untold\nhours negotiating the terms and implications of the [agreement] with Epstein’s\nattorneys, scant information was shared with victims.”\n\nThis comes as Acosta, who is now the U.S. secretary of labor, is facing mounting\nscrutiny for his oversight of the Epstein case. On Monday, White House press\nsecretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to say whether President Trump has full\nconfidence in Acosta, noting that Acosta’s involvement in the Epstein case is\n“currently under review.”\n\nThe Justice Department launched a probe in January into whether Acosta, Villafafia\nand other prosecutors committed professional misconduct.\n\nFrancey Hakes, who worked in the Justice Department’s Crimes Against Children\nunit, said Zloch’s comments were so brutal that it should have deterred Acosta and\nVillafafia from keeping the deal secret.\n\n“Tt is highly unusual for a court to allege an assistant U.S. attorney has intentionally\nwithheld information.

Ultimately we are drawn to the question of whether\nthe wars were won by one side or another, or whether it’s more accurate to say that they simply\nfaded away.

WTC Attack — 9/11 (2001)\n3. BENGHAZI Attack — 9/11 (2012)\nBut you have to remember that H. W. Bush was planted:\n\nAUTHOR PETER DALE SCOTT: Sometimes you have little deep events that most people don't even\nnotice. One of those would be the Halloween Massacre. The older people remember the Saturday\nNight Massacre which happened under Nixon. I'm talking about the Halloween Massacre of October\n31, 1975, and probably people watching this show have never heard of it.\n\nThat was under Ford, and Ford may have condoned it because it was trying to help restore his\npopularity. He was going way down in the polls. But it was a very important series of events all on the\nsame night. The head of the CIA was fired, William Colby, replaced by a relatively unknown man\ncalled George H. W. Bush who then went on to authorize something that Colby had refused to\nauthorize - the Team B report - the Team B to recalculate the Soviet threat and it was pre-\ndetermined. They were going to find that it was much bigger than the professionals angled like\nRaymond [inaudible] that | mentioned.\n\nThey said Russia is less of a threat now than it used to be. Well, that was terrible news for the\nindustrial complex so the Team B came in and said oh, no, no, no, it's much more of a threat than it\nused to be, and that's why we got this huge military build-up. It started actually under Carter but we\nthink of it as the Reagan build-up, and that of course is a major factor in having ended the Soviet\nUnion because the Soviet Union tried to match it with a weaker economy. And that arms race which\nwas not about threats but was about fighting economic war, that was an arms race which you could\nsay that the Soviet Union lost because they couldn't keep it up. Their economy went more and more\ndownhill because they were deflecting resources away from vital domestic functions. But really I'm\ntrying to talk here about the Halloween Massacre...\n\nJust the change in the CIA was a major historical event but it wasn't very visible. The second thing\nthat happened was they fired Jim Schlesinger as Secretary of Defense... It was being done by\n[President Ford's] Chief of Staff and his assistant who are two names barely known then but quite\nfamous since. Chief of staff was Donald Rumsfeld and the assistant was Dick Cheney. And that was\nthe first real intrusion of the Rumsfeld-Cheney team into American politics. And they became the real\nheart of what | consider the Deep State in the 1980s when they were planning for Continuity of\nGovernment which was a plan for emergency rules like warrantless surveillance and warrantless\ndetention and the militarization of homeland security. All those things were planned all through the\n‘80s - COG planning by Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney. Even when Rumsfeld wasn't in the\ngovernment, he was authorized by Reagan to do this planning.\n\nAnd why is that important to our history? Because in 2001, these two men were now in the\ngovernment - Vice President and Secretary of Defense - the two top people in Washington on\nSeptember the 11th, 2001 when Bush was down in Florida - George W. Bush - and what did they do\non that day? They implemented the plans they had been planning for 20 years. Another major event\nin American history but it's not usually told that way.\n\nWe implemented - it’s in the 9/11 Commission Report that COG plans were implemented on that day.\nThis is a huge change in our country. We now have an ARMY command, NORTHCOM, to take\ncharge of America - North America, the way SOUTHCOM is in charge of South America and\nCENTCOM is in charge of Central Asia.\n\nThis used to be illegal...

I managed to get his statement\nback to the United States. Shortly thereafter he was released and came to live in my home while\nhe was trying to get into school here.\n\nMy interest in Soviet Jewry was stimulated by Elie Wiesel’s wonderful book Zhe Jews of Silence.\nBut it became a passion only after a more personal encounter. In 1971, I was invited to become a\nfellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences on the Stanford campus in\nPalo Alto, California. Forty fellows were invited from all over the world, to spend the year\nwriting and thinking. This year for the first time, a fellow had been invited from Communist\nRomania, Michael Cernea. He was Chairman of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology\nat the University of Bucharest and an active member of the Romanian Communist Party. On the\nday before Rosh Hashanah, he invited me to take a walk with him through the woods. When we\nwere away from any possibility of surveillance he told me that his real name was Moishe Katz,\nthat he was a committed Jew, and that he desperately wanted to defect along with his family from\nCommunist Romania and move either to the United States or Israel. He swore me to secrecy and\nasked if I would become his pro-bono lawyer in what would surely be a long-term activity, since\nhis family was being held hostage back in Romania. I immediately agreed and invited him to my\nhome for dinner that night, where we stayed up until dawn, listening to Jewish cantorial music,\nwhich he had not heard since his youth some thirty years earlier. Tears flowed freely from his\neyes. Several years later, we were able to arrange for him and his wife to be out of the country at\nthe same time, and they both defected, leaving his two children and his elderly mother behind.\nBut within a year or so, with the help of Senator Kennedy and others, we managed to get the\nwhole family out. We have remained close friends since that time.\n\nAnother close friend who started out as a client is Natan Sharansky, now a cabinet member of the\nIsraeli government. When I represented him his name was Anatoly Sharansky and he was an\nimprisoned Soviet refusenick. His mother and wife asked me, along with my friend and colleague\nIrwin Cotler, now the Minister of Justice in Canada, to represent Anatoly on a pro-bono basis.\nWe continued to be his lawyer for nearly nine years. We were not allowed to meet our client or\neven to communicate with him. For all we knew, he had no idea we were his lawyers. But we\nrepresented him vigorously in the court of public opinion as well as in the courts of the Soviet\nUnion. We were also involved in proposed prisoner exchanges which included Sharansky, Nelson\nMandela and several Eastern European spies being held by the United States. Neither Sharansky\nnor Mandela wanted to be part of any exchange for real spies, since they were political dissidents.\nIt is interesting to note, a especially in light of Sharansky’s high position in the Israeli government,\nthat when Sharansky was first arrested, the Israeli government wanted to have nothing to do with\nhis case, since they regarded him as a human rights dissident rather than as a prisoner of Zion. He\nwas, of course, both. When he was finally released some of the very same people who fought\nhardest against Israel doing anything on his behalf were among the first to claim credit for his\nrelease.\n\nI will never forget how I watched my client walk - - really bounce - - across the Glinicke Bridge\nand into the safety of the West. I knew he was well even while watching him on television.\n\nShortly thereafter I met him in person for the first time. He threw his arms around me and\nwhispered in my ear, “Baruch matir asurim,” which means, “Blessed be those who help free the\n\n325\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017412\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

To\nthis day, I doubt that Woody Allen knows how Robert Morvillo tried to use his case to settle a\nscore with me.\n\nShortly after it was publicly announced that I would be helping to defend Mia Farro against the\nlawsuit brought by Woody Allen, my phone rang.

What can I do to help?”\n\nI told Mr. Sinatra that I appreciated the call but that the legal case was under control.\n\nHe quickly responded, “Well beyond the legal case, what can I do to call Woody off?”\n\nAware of Sinatra’s reputation as a tough guy, I nervously told him to leave it to the lawyers and\nthat any approach to Woody Allen would be used against Mia and would backfire.\n\nSeveral months later, during the summer, Andre Previn—another of Mia’s former husbands—was\nperforming in the Whaling Church on Martha’s Vineyard. My wife and I attended his concert and\nthen went to a reception that followed. Previn, like Sinatra, told me how much he loved Mia and\n\nthat she was a great person.\n\nHe continued, “I feel like marching up to his apartment, knocking on the door, and punching him\nin the face, telling him to leave Mia alone.”\n\nRecalling the Sinatra call, I let out an uncontrollable laugh.

The goal is to simulate the\nphysical human form, its movements and mannerisms. It’s easy to get\nclose, but close is not good enough. The term “Uncanny Valley’ has been\ncoined to describe the discomfort humans have with something that tries\nto simulate a human being but does not quite get there. I think it is part\nof the reason Madam Tussaud’s waxworks are so fascinating. Humans\nhave a love-hate relationship with facsimiles of themselves. They love\nthe flattery but feel a sense of revulsion at anything that comes too close.\n\nSearle and Turing\n\nIn the Turing Test, we limited our senses to the purely symbolic: using\nonly typed words on a screen. I could break the lock on the door and go\ninto the room to see what was there.\n\n“Aha!” I would say.\n\n“I can see you're a computer, I, therefore, know you'll be good at\nsums and bad at creativity”\n\nBut Turing wants us to see if the difference is given away purely\nthrough intellect. He argues there is no way to tell. But if you follow my\nargument from chapter 1, there is one way: ask the computer to find a\nnon-computable solution to a mathematical puzzle. This is, in practice,\na difficult test to pose because it might take a very long time. Twenty-\nfive billion people have lived on planet Earth during the last 350 years,\nand about 5 million of them were mathematicians. None of them was\nable to solve the problem posed by Pierre de Fermat until Andrew Wiles\nturned up but this is a clear difference between humans and computers.\nHowever long you give a computer it would never be able to solve the\nproblem.\n\nThis creativity test would take centuries to run if non-computable\nthought was rare, but I think we see it often — on display even when we\ntell jokes. In which case computers and humans should be easy to tell\napart: humans are the funny ones. I am not saying you can't build a brain;\nour brains are physical devices, after all. I just believe a computer or a\nmechanistic machine, cannot think like a human being.\n\nI like the Searle argument but qualitative arguments are insufficient.\nWe need a quantitative argument. In the forthcoming chapters, I am\ngoing to look at the mathematical argument underlying the difference\nbetween human intelligence and computer processing. Before we do this\nlet’s take one last look at a qualitative difference; the way computers and\nhumans communicate.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015765\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Some were operational. It is true we ended up overcoming Palestinian\nand Syrian resistance. Given the numerical balance of forces, that was a\nforegone conclusion. But with all the attention paid to the political aims of the\ninvasion, we’d never sufficiently planned for operating against a wholly\ndifferent kind of enemy than in our previous wars, and on a wholly different\nkind of terrain. Huge columns of Israeli armor had found themselves stuck on\nthe winding roads of central Lebanon, running low on gasoline, vulnerable to\nrelatively small ambush squads. In some instances, a dozen Palestinian fighters\nor Syrian commandos had halted the best-armed, best-trained, tank forces in the\nMiddle East for hours on end. Overall, the pattern of past wars had been broken.\nEven in 1973, once the surprise attacks had been turned back, Israeli forces had\nadvanced, attacked and broken enemy resistance. That hadn’t happened here.\n\nThere was a deeper problem as well. At the start of the conflict, Begin had\ndeclared, boastfully almost, that this was Israel’s first “war of choice.” That\nwasn’t true. Both 1956 and 1967 were wars of choice. Yet those preemptive\nattacks, especially in the Six-Day War, were in response to a sense of strategic\nthreat that was commonly understood by almost all Israelis. There was a sense\nnot just of consensus, but national unity. This war was different. It had been\nlaunched in pursuit of a specific political vision: a marriage of Begin’s political\ncredo and Arik’s determination to use overwhelming force to bulldoze a new\npolitical reality in Lebanon.\n\nThe findings of the inquiry commission were published in February 1983.\nThey were all the more powerful for the forensic language used. The inquiry did\nconcede Begin’s point: it was Gemayel’s men who had actually done the\nkilling. But it said that the Israel1 commanders’ decision to allow the\nPhalangists into the refugee camps “was taken without consideration of the\ndanger — which the makers and executors of the decision were obligated to\nforesee as probable — that the Phalangists would commit massacres.” The\ncommission added that “when the reports began to arrive about the actions of\nthe Phalangists in the camps, no proper heed was taken. The correct conclusions\nwere not drawn. No energetic and immediate action was taken to restrain the\nPhalangists and put a stop to their actions.”\n\nArik bore personal responsibility for this, the report said. So did Raful, and\nthe head of military intelligence, Yehoshua Saguy.

It was charged with monitoring\nnuclear proliferation in Iran, Pakistan, and North Korea, poten-\ntial jihadist threats everywhere in the world, and much else. The\nRussian foreign intelligence service, the SVR, could put its limited\nresources to work on redressing the gap with its main enemy: the\nUnited States.\n\nNevertheless, Putin had to reckon with the reality in 2013 that\nRussia could not compete with the NSA in the business of inter-\ncepting communications. And if the NSA could listen in on all the\ninternal activities of its spy agencies and security regime, the ability\nof Putin to use covert means to achieve his other global ambitions\nwould be impaired. In the cold peace that replaced the Cold War,\nRussia had little hope of realizing these ambitions unless it could\nweaken the NSA’‘s iron-tight grip on global communications intel-\nligence. One way to remedy the imbalance between Russian intel-\nligence and the NSA was via espionage. Here the SVR would be the\ninstrument, and the immediate objective would be to acquire the\nNSA’s lists of its sources in Russia. If successful, it would be a game\n\n© changer. ®\n\nSuch an ambitious penetration of the NSA, to be sure, was a tall\norder for Russian intelligence. Most of its moles recruited in the\nNSA by the KGB had been code clerks, guards, translators, and low-\nlevel analysts. They provided documents about the NSA‘s cipher\nbreaking, but they lacked access to the lists of the NSA’s sources and\nmethods. These meager results did not inhibit Russian efforts. For\nsix decades, ever since the inception of the NSA in 1952, the Russian\nintelligence service had engaged in a covert war with the NSA.\n\nThe Russian intelligence service is, as far as is known, the only\nintelligence service in the world that ever succeeded in penetrating\nthe NSA. A number of NSA employees also defected to Moscow.\nThe history of this venerable enterprise is instructive.\n\nThe first two defectors in the NSA’s history were William Mar-\ntin and Bernon Mitchell. They were mathematicians working on the\nNSA’s decryption machines who went to Moscow via Cuba in 1960.\nThe Russian intelligence service, then called the KGB, went to great\nlengths to get propaganda value from their defections. It even orga-\nnized a ninety-minute press conference for them on September 6,\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r.indd 222 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019710\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The Hong Kong authorities had been advised as early as\nJune 19, 2013 that there were criminal charges against Snowden and only a typographical error in\nspelling out Snowden’s middle name—James instead of John-- in the criminal charges prevented\nthe Hong Kong police from immediately ordering his detention. His Hong Kong lawyers were\nadvised of the pending charges, which were unsealed on June 21, 2013 and published on front\npage of the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong. So presumably Snowden knew that action\nby the U.S. government was imminent. One of his lawyers, Jonathan Mann, even accompanied\nSnowden to the airport out of his concern that he would not even be allowed by Hong Kong\nauthorities to go through passport control. Although Snowden still had a US passport in his\npossession, the computerized database would show on June 23rd, it was no longer valid for travel\nto anywhere but the U.S.\n\nThis electronic notification advised foreign government that his passport was only approved for\nhis return to the U.S. Even so, when he arrived in Russia any future international travel decisions\nfor him would be up to Russia, not the U.S. So the only government with the means to “trap”\nhim in Russia was the Russian government.\n\nThe U.S. government also knew that his it was no accident that Snowden wound up in the\nhands of Russia. He had been in contact with Russian officials in Hong Kong. Even before Putin\nadmitted this liaison on September 3, 2013, the CIA knew about it. In fact, on June 23™, t,\nSenator Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), correctly said based on a White House briefing that\n“Vladimir Putin had personally approved Snowden’s flight” to Moscow. As mentioned earlier,\nthe NSA still had the capability to monitor Russian communication in June 2013. The messages,\nas well as the traffic, it intercepted from its sources reportedly revealed the Russian intelligence\nactivity in Hong Kong. The NSA also reportedly intercepted contacts between these Russian\nofficials and Russian representatives of Aeroflot, the Russian state-owned airline flying between\nHong Kong and Moscow. Aeroflot, like most other international carriers, ordinarily requires\ninternational passengers to have both a valid passport and visa to the country of his destination.\nThat those rules were waived for Snowden implicated Aeroflot in Snowden’s exfiltration from\nHong Kong. All of which meant to investigators that Snowden’s defection to Moscow was not a\nhaphazard result of unexpected circumstances. This raised new questions for the investigation.\nWhat led Snowden to defect to Russia? Was his arrival in Moscow planned by Russia intelligence\nin advance? Was any other party, such as China, privy to the plan? Was there a quid pro quo?\n\nUS intelligence had some clues suggesting that Snowden’s path to Russia had been prepared\nfor him in advance. On September 3, 2013, Russia’s President Putin gave a lengthy interview on\nstate-owned Channel | television in which he divulged that he personally had had advance\nknowledge of Snowden’s plan. “I will tell you something I have never said before,” Putin said.\nSnowden \"first went to Hong Kong and got in touch with our diplomatic representatives” and\nthat he was told then that an American \"agent of special services\" was seeking to come to Russia.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020191\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Don’t be in a rush to jump into a full-time long-term commitment. Take time to find\nsomething that calls to you, not just the first acceptable form of surrogate work.

An out-of-\ncontrol arms race in lethal autonomous weapons that drives the price of automated\nanonymous assassination toward zero will be very hard to stop once it gains momentum.\nThe second goal would require reversing the current trend in some Western countries\nwhere sectors of the population are getting poorer in absolute terms, fueling anger,\nresentment, and polarization. Unless the third goal can be met, all the wonderful AI\ntechnology we create might harm us, either accidentally or deliberately.\n\nAI safety research must be carried out with a strict deadline in mind: Before AGI\narrives, we need to figure out how to make AI understand, adopt, and retain our goals.\nThe more intelligent and powerful machines get, the more important it becomes to align\ntheir goals with ours. As long as we build relatively dumb machines, the question isn’t\nwhether human goals will prevail but merely how much trouble the machines can cause\nbefore we solve the goal-alignment problem. If a superintelligence 1s ever unleashed,\nhowever, it will be the other way around: Since intelligence is the ability to accomplish\ngoals, a superintelligent AI is by definition much better at accomplishing its goals than\nwe humans are at accomplishing ours, and will therefore prevail.\n\nIn other words, the real risk with AGI isn’t malice but competence. A\nsuperintelligent AGI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals\naren’t aligned with ours, we’re in trouble. People don’t think twice about flooding\nanthills to build hydroelectric dams, so let’s not place humanity in the position of those\nants. Most researchers argue that if we end up creating superintelligence, we should\nmake sure it’s what Al-safety pioneer Eliezer Yudkowsky has termed “friendly AI’—AI\nwhose goals are in some deep sense beneficial.\n\nThe moral question of what these goals should be is just as urgent as the technical\nquestions about goal alignment. For example, what sort of society are we hoping to\ncreate, where we find meaning and purpose in our lives even though we, strictly\nspeaking, aren’t needed? I’m often given the following glib response to this\nquestion: “Let’s build machines that are smarter than us and then let them figure out the\nanswer!” This mistakenly equates intelligence with morality. Intelligence isn’t good or\nevil but morally neutral. It’s simply an ability to accomplish complex goals, good or bad.\nWe can’t conclude that things would have been better if Hitler had been more intelligent.\nIndeed, postponing work on ethical issues until after goal-aligned AGI is built would be\nirresponsible and potentially disastrous. A perfectly obedient superintelligence whose\ngoals automatically align with those of its human owner would be like Nazi SS-\nObersturmbannfithrer Adolf Eichmann on steroids. Lacking moral compass or\ninhibitions of its own, it would, with ruthless efficiency, implement its owner’s goals,\nwhatever they might be.!?\n\nWhen I speak of the need to analyze technology risk, ’m sometimes accused of\nscaremongering.

Objective: an alliance between \nright-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections \nNEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru who \nwas Donald Trump's right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following the racist \nviolence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the Daily Beast \nhimself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (II Movimento), right in the heart of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019312 \nEurope and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the \nEuropean elections which will be held in spring 2019. \nObjective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor of \nthe Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in support of \nNGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist right, accused \nof plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to have \nlabour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the Interior \nMatteo Salvini. \nThe ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in the \nEuropean campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and \nRome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great \"populist international\" of which he \nhas long since been dreaming. \nThe Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic \nadvice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European \nmovements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling \nfunding. \nThe aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of \"super group\" that if victorious can conquer up to a \nthird of the European Parliament in the elections next May. \nIndeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The \nAmerican strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress \n— and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data stolen \nfrom Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump emerged victor. \nIt is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West. And he has \nalready met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and the former leader of \nthe British separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on Friday in Pennsylvania, \nUSA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. Without forgetting the \nItalians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: \"If it works in Italy, we can import the model \nanywhere\". \nThe Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. In \nshort, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries \nsupporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But in \nthe future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also because \nthe relationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff and \npublished in the scandal book \"Fire and Fury\". \"Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Paradise,\" \nBannon says now paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost Paradise. \nHell in this case would be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The \"army of darkness\" is \nalready among us. \nIn Sacratissimo Corde Iesu et Purissimo Corde Mariae et Castissimo Corde Ioseph. \n******* \nBenjamin Harnwell \nFounder and President of the Board of Trustees \nDignitatis Humanae Institute \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019313 \nCell: \nOfficl \n- \nIstituto Dignitatis Humanae \n44 Via delle Fornaci  \nRoma 00165  \nITALY  \n@ben harnwell \n_ \nwww.dignitatishumanae.corn \nII giorno 22 lug 2018, alle ore 15:38, Steve Bannon <I> ha scritto: \nWhat does this say??? \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: Maria Luisa \nW \nDate: July 22, 2018 at 9:11:58 AM EDT \nTo: Steve Bannon <11111>, Preate Alexandra <41.1 \n<PHOTO-2018-07-22-10-02-17.jpg> \nSent from my iPhone \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

Victims never got that opportunity when Epstein faced criminal charges, because \nAlex Acosta___then the lead prosecutor, now the Secretary of Labor___let Epstein off with \na ridiculously lenient sentence. Despite having committed hideous sex offenses with dozens \nof minors, Epstein received a sentence of 13 months in jail, during which he was often free \nduring the day. \nEpstein's decision to buy his out of the civil lawsuit, one that he had the nerve to initiate, \nbenefits Acosta. The trial would have provided non-stop headlines, coupled with frequent \nreferences to the sweetheart deal Acosta gave him. As Randy Schultz puts it, the trial would \nhave been the occasion for a long overdue public shaming of Acosta. Now, he avoids this \nconsequence. \nBut this doesn't mean Acosta is out of the woods. He faces calls for his ouster from the \nTrump cabinet. \nSome calls are from the usual suspects. Michelle Goldberg of the New York Times has \nwritten a piece so obnoxious that it almost makes me want to see Acosta ride out the storm. \nBut some conservatives are also advocating Acosta's departure. Concerned Women for \nAmerica is a stalwart conservative organization. It describes itself, accurately, as \"focus[ed] \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030958 \non seven core issues: the family, the sanctity of human life, religious liberty, education, \nsexual exploitation, national sovereignty, and support for Israel.\" (Emphasis added) \nIts leader, Penny Nance, has called for Acosta's resignation. Noting that labor trafficking, \nwhich the Labor Department combats, is often conjoined with sex trafficking, Nance says \nthat President Trump would not have nominated Acosta if reports fully describing Acosta's \nconduct in the Epstein case had emerged earlier. \nSen. Ben Sasse has also weighed in. He sent a letter to the Justice Department asking it to \ninvestigate its treatment of Epstein, including the fact that the plea deal ensured that victims \nof the pervert would be denied the ability to comment on or object to the leniency of his \nsentence. Sasse is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Oversight, \nAgency Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts. \nSen. Marco Rubio, a longtime supporter of Acosta, says it would be \"very troubling\" if \npolitical influence led to a light sentence for Epstein. In Rubio's view, and that of every \nrational person, Epstein \"should have been in jail for a long time.\" Rubio added, however, \nthat he will reserve judgment until he hears Acosta's side. \nThat's fair. But so far, Acosta has provided no real defense for letting Epstein off so lightly. \nIn public, at least, he is standing by his argument that the deal was a reasonable one and that \nthis is old news. \nPreviously, Acosta had a different defense. He cited \"a year-long assault on the prosecution \nand the prosecutors\" by \"an army of legal superstars\" who represented Epstein. This \nallegedly included \"defense counsel investigat[ing] individual prosecutors and their \nfamilies, looking for personal peccadilloes that may provide a basis for disqualification.\" In \nthis account, the deal was made to relieve the pressure, while still getting a conviction. \nAcosta could hardly assert this explanation____i.e., that he wimped out___while seeking a \ncabinet position with the expectation of being appointed to more exalted jobs in the future. \nNor is the explanation particularly plausible. Acosta isn't the first prosecutor to face a \nscorched earth defense. Ask Ken Starr about this. \nI don't doubt that Acosta regarded escaping the wrath of the defense team as a benefit of \nreaching the plea deal. But I don't believe this was incentive enough to cause him, in effect, \nto throw the case. \nWhat was the true incentive? As I wrote when this story broke, I think it was the same \nincentive that explains much of his conduct in public life___Acosta's desire to \naccommodate people he thinks can help him down the road. \nWhich people? Probably the lawyers at Kirkland and Ellis, where Acosta had once worked. \nEpstein enlisted Ken Starr* and Jay Lefkowitz, both of Kirkland, for his defense team. \nAcosta reportedly worked out the terms of his surrender with Lefkowitz, a former \ncolleague, at a meeting in a location far away from the prosecutor's office. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030959 \nThe location of the meeting is itself suspicious. Prosecutors and other law enforcement \nofficials normally demand that those seeking a deal come to them. \nThe fact that Acosta didn't is another sign___if one were needed___that this was a \ncapitulation. It also casts further doubt on the claim that Acosta was capitulating for the \npurpose of sparing the folks who worked with him in the prosecutor's office. \nThe key point, though, is that Ken Starr and Jay Lefkowitz were power players in \nWashington___men who might help Acosta down the road. \nReaders will be quite familiar with Starr's background. Lefkowitz was director of cabinet \naffairs and deputy executive secretary to the domestic policy council under President \nGeorge H.W. Bush. Under President George W. Bush, Lefkowitz served as general counsel \nin the Office of Management and Budget and later as deputy director of domestic policy at \nthe White House. \nAccommodating such influential figures must have seemed like a good career move. \nHaving Starr and Lefkowitz on his side might help Acosta get a judgeship, a cabinet \nappointment, or a high-paying job back at Kirkland and Ellis. \nI'm speculating, of course. But my speculation finds support in Acosta's practice of \naccommodating the powerful. \nMuch of that accommodation is of Democrats. Indeed, at the time Acosta was working in \nMiami as a U.S. Attorney, he had alienated some Republicans by such accommodation  \nwhile at the Department of Justice. Some say he was on the verge of being fired when \nAttorney General Alberto Gonzalez parachuted him to Miami. The Epstein settlement was a \nway for Acosta to shore up his standing with some influential Republicans. \nWill Acosta be able to survive the current scandal? I don't have a clear sense about this yet. \nBut President Trump, who isn't bashful about sacking cabinet members, may come to \nbelieve (if he doesn't now) that it's disadvantageous to have a cabinet member who sold out \nteenage victims of sexual abuse, especially when the sell-out benefited an ultra-wealthy \nserial offender. \n* Some on the left are trying to make something or the fact that Starr, who had investigated \nBill Clinton in connection with sexual misconduct, later defended Epstein, a pervert. This is \nsilly. \nIn both instances, Starr was doing his job as a lawyer. Perverts are entitled to a defense and \nthere is nothing hypocritical about investigating Bill Clinton's misconduct when that was \nStarr's job and later joining the team that was defending Jeffrey Epstein. \nAcosta, by contrast, was on the team seeking justice for Epstein and for his victims. He \ngave up this quest for reasons that can't be defended. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030960 \nSent from my iPad \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

This is the most effective way to solve a creative programming\ntask. Practically, once your task is over the limit for a single human, a\nsoftware project must be split up. This requires great care. Dividing a\nproblem efficiently means specifying the interfaces between them and\ndecoupling the components. This is the art of an architect or a producer\nin the creative arts. The creative process operates similarly in other walks\nof life. There are many examples of successful creative duos — Rogers\nand Hammerstein (The Sound of Music), Ben Elton and Richard Curtis\n(Blackadder).\n\nGood managers, therefore, find ways to break projects into\nmanageable sub-projects that can be worked by pairs or rely on single\nsuper-programmers with support around them. If you are lucky enough\nto gather together a group of super-programmers and can divide a\nproblem efficiently amongst them, you can achieve great things. You\nsee this pipeline in movie production. A script writer generates a script\ncreatively. The casting director finds the actors, a director is in charge of\nfilming, and an editor puts it together. In very great movies you will often\nfind a great director or producer who had a hand in almost everything\nholding it all together. They are often accused of micro-managing but\nyou can see that’s what they must do. They are the super-programmer\nwith the whole creative work in their head, and an eye on the audience\nand financial backers.\n\nIf you talk with great programmers you will be amazed by their\nbreadth of technical, commercial and product knowledge. Why do they\nneed all this commercial information to do their job in the round?\n\nRules and Tips\n\nI began writing some rules on how to split up a project, and almost\nimmediately ran into exceptions and special cases. The job of dividing\nthings into sub-tasks is, itself, a creative problem and must not be done\nmechanically. Any ‘one size fits all’ rule will fail and you must apply\ndomain knowledge and careful thought to the process.\n\nIt is the job of architects or a senior engineer to split projects into\nsmaller chunks. To do this they must accurately ‘guess’ boundaries\nbetween subtasks to create self-contained, creatively solvable problems.\nThis can be done by either vertical or horizontal abstraction. Both have\ntheir problems.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015956\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In that case, a series of errors resulted in the loss of three transmission lines in Ohio over the course of about an\nhour. Once the third line went down, the outage cascaded towards the coast, cutting power to some 50 million people.\nHavlin says that this outage is an example of the inherent instability his study describes, but others question whether the\nteam’s conclusions can really be extrapolated to the real world.\n\n“| suppose | should be open-minded to new research, but I'm not convinced,” says Jeff Dagle, an electrical engineer at the\nPacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington, who served on the government task force that investigated\nthe 2003 outage. “The problem is that this doesn’t reflect the physics of how the power grid operates.”\n\nCritical order\n\nHavlin and his colleagues focused on idealized scenarios. They found that randomly structured networks — such as social\nnetworks — degrade slowly as nodes are removed, which in the real world might mean there is time to diagnose and\naddress a problem before a system collapses. By contrast, the connections of orderly lattice structures have more critical\nnodes, which increase the instability. The problem is that such orderly networks are always operating near an indefinable\nedge, Havlin says. To reduce that risk, he recommends adding a small number of longer transmission lines that provide\nshort cuts to different parts of the grid.\n\nBenjamin Carreras, a physicist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee who has conducted similar work2, says that\nnetwork theory can be useful for providing insight into electric grids but must be complemented with more complex models\nthat attempt to represent both the physical realities and the responsiveness of the modern electric grid. Although in some\ncases adding long lines can benefit the overall stability of an electric system, Carreras’ work suggests that in certain\ncircumstances such an approach allows problems to propagate even farther.\n\n“More connections may stabilize some processes, by, for instance, increasing the number of paths to generators, but also\nmay destabilize others,” Carreras says. “One cannot make generic statements on this topic.”\n\nAlthough local outages caused by falling trees knocking down distribution lines are common, large-scale failures within the\ncore ne transmission lines rarely occur ona modern electric grid. Before 2003, the last major blackout in the United States\nhad been on the west coast in 1996, and more recently an outage has struck in the San Diego area.\n\nDagle says that the 2003 blackout stemmed from a combination of bad vegetation management — the first three lines\ntripped after sagging into trees but were all within their load rating — and a series of monitoring and communications\nbreakdowns. Vegetation requirements have since been standardized, and a new generation of sensors is providing grid\noperators with more information about what is happening across the grid at any given moment.\n\n“Many more utilities have much more data,” Dagle says. “The next phase of our voyage is to make better use of that data.”\nBack to top\nTechnology — Full text articles\n\nBallmer Departure From Microsoft Was More Sudden Than Portrayed by the Company\nKara Swisher — All Things D\n\nAccording to sources close to the situation, the departure of CEO Steve Ballmer from Microsoft last week was more sudden\nthan was depicted by the company in its announcement that he would be retiring within the next year in a planned smooth\ntransition.\n\nIt was neither planned nor as smooth as portrayed.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028628\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

To return the favor, Matthews\nallegedly bought a condo in Washington, D.C., from Rowland through a straw buyer\nin 1997 for nearly 20 percent more than what the governor had originally paid.\n\nThe condo sale and other business dealings eventually led to a corruption\ninvestigation into Rowland.

As Michael\nHartnett pointed out, 2016 saw global interest rates fall to 5,000-year lows and the\nlikely end of what has been the greatest bull market in bonds ever. We experienced a\nhistoric US Presidential election and Republican sweep of Congress on November 9th.\nLater that same month, OPEC reached a historic deal to reduce crude production by\n1.2mn b/d with non-OPEC producers delivering an additional 600k b/d of cuts – the first\nsuch joint curb since 1998. Risk assets responded with 30-year Treasury reaching a\nyield of 2.088% in July, US equity markets reaching all-time highs, and oil prices rallying\nmore than 40% since the start of the year. Given the Republican sweep - and the\nresulting likelihood that the logjam of Washington gridlock will be broken - our Top 10\nstock selections are more heavily geared toward companies that may benefit from\nincreased fiscal stimulus, a more pro-business agenda, and/or tax-policy reform.

The list\nreflects primarily a bottoms-up approach, with calendar-specific events noted for most\nstocks. We constructed our list by canvassing BofAML Fundamental Equity Research\nanalysts in order to find 10 BofAML-covered stocks which we think will significantly\noutperform or underperform peers during the quarter. We considered only Buy-rated\nnames for outperform ideas and Underperform-rated names for underperform ideas. We\nthen narrowed the list after consulting our Equity Research colleagues.\nTo be eligible for the list, the stock must be covered by BofA Merrill Lynch AMRS\nfundamental equity analysts with a rating of Buy or Underperform, for long and short\nstock recommendations, respectively.\nStocks will be chosen on a discretionary basis by the Alpha Generation team, which\ncurrently includes strategists with experience choosing stocks for BofAML’s US 1 list.\nStocks will be chosen for the list using a bottoms-up approach after taking into account\nthe views of the relevant BofA Merrill Lynch Fundamental Equity analyst and upcoming\ncatalysts. Diversity of the list and BofAML macro views will also be factors in choosing\nstocks for the list.\nStocks on the list will generally remain on the list during the quarter. However, a stock\nwill be removed interim quarter if considered ineligible due to a change in the stock’s\nfundamental rating, or if the stock is no long covered by BofA Merrill Lynch fundamental\nEquity Research. When stocks are removed during the quarter, they will not be replaced.\nStocks will generally be removed from the list at the end of the quarter in conjunction\nwith the publication of the next quarter’s list, but may on select occasions remain on the\nlist if the identified catalyst remains relevant or a new catalyst is expected to drive the\nrequisite over/under performance. Any intra-quarter actions to the list will be announced\nin a research report.\nThe Top 10 list will be published on or close to the first day of each quarter. In addition,\nwe may also publish research reports updating the catalysts’ status or other news on\nparticular stocks during the quarter.\nHow the list will be maintained and updated\nWe will publish this list at the beginning of each quarter. Ideas will generally remain on\nthe list through the quarter unless coverage is dropped or the recommendation changes.\nAny security which is removed will not be replaced. If there are any changes to the list\nduring the quarter we will promptly publish a note explaining the change.

PF 2018 earnings\nshould be close to $11.50 (vs $9.70 consensus), even before taking into account the\nupside from tax reform (+15% to EPS) and rising interest rates (+5%).

While we were not concerned about\nSIVB's ability to transition into a CCAR bank, the removal of this should no doubt serve\nas a positive. At $43bn in assets, becoming a CCAR bank had been weighing on investor\nsentiment. With expectations for this threshold to be pushed higher, this should no\nlonger be a significant concern when thinking about SIVB's growth trajectory. Another\nissue that has not been discussed much but could occur is any changes in the Volcker\nrule that would allow the bank to once again participate in investing capital in PE/VC\nfunds. We view this restriction as an unintended consequence on SIVB stemming from\nthe Volcker rule and the ability once again participate in these funds would be a\nsignificant positive given the potential for getting equity exposure in the early stages of\nthe life cycle of start-up companies.\nTax Policy: With SIVB paying an effective tax rate of 40.6% in 2016 YTD, the bank will\nundoubtedly be a beneficiary from a lower corporate tax rate.

We expect TXN to continue to generate industry leading FCF while growing its\ndividend at 20%+ CAGR. We look toward the strategy update call in early February as\nthe next catalyst for the stock.\nTable 1: Texas Instruments key stock data\nIndustry\nSemiconductors\nMarket Cap (mn) $73,899\nPrice $74.15\nP/E (2017) 20.1x\n% of sell-side rated Buy 35.3%\nShort interest % of float 1.75%\nSource: Bloomberg and BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates\nDeregulation/Gov’t Legislation: 60% of TXN’s sales are exposed to the industrial,\nautomotive, and communications equipment end markets. We think these markets could\nTop 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017 13\nsee the most uplift in spending from any potentially large fiscal stimulus and\ninfrastructure spending under the new US administration.\nTax Policy: Unlike most semis, TXN reports its financials on a pure GAAP basis and its\ntax rate at 30% is one of the highest in the industry. We think TXN stands to\ndisproportionately benefit from the looser tax policies foreshadowed by the upcoming\nadministration. Specifically, a 10% drop in the corporate tax rate would lead to 15%\nhigher EPS for TXN in 2017, all else equal.\nCatalysts: (1) Seasonally stronger period for industrial/automotive spending – 46% of\nTXN’s revenue come from these end markets; (2) Annual strategy and capital allocation\npolicy update call with shareholders which is likely to occur at the beginning of February.\nLatest report: The new \"industrials\": growth recovery plus pricing power,\nBuy TXN, ADI, MCHP, ON\n1Q risks: (1) Still somewhat large (>10%) exposure to consumer electronics could create\nnear-term volatility in topline results; (2) Historically lumpy communications equipment\nspending trends; (3) Larger than expected slowdown in North America automotive unit\nproduction\nCompany Description: Texas Instruments is a broad-based supplier of semiconductor\ncomponents, ranging from digital signal processors, to high-performance analog\ncomponents, to digital light-processing technology and calculators. 65% of TXN sales\nare exposed to the well diversified, business-to-business Industrial, Automotive,\nCommunications Infrastructure, and Enterprise markets.\nTripAdvisor (TRIP)\nNat Schindler +1 415 676 3574\nResearch Analyst, MLPF&S\nUnderperform, PO $41\n1Q investment thesis\nDespite easier y/y comps in 2017, we see risk that Click-based & Transaction Hotel\nrevenue continues to decline as 1) higher monetizing desktop traffic structurally\ndeclines, 2) mobile monetization remains at 30% of desktop traffic and is unlikely to\nmeaningfully close the gap, and 3) Instant Book is unlikely to help reverse the revenue\nand earnings trend. At the same time, TRIP has been accelerating marketing spend,\nimplying increasing acquisition costs, with further ad spend ramp in ‘17. TRIP noted\n2017 EBITDA margin will decline further from 2016 levels as ad spend ticks up to reaccelerate\ngrowth.\nTable 1: TripAdvisor key stock data\nIndustry\nOnline Travel\nMarket Cap (mn) $9,071\nPrice $46.95\nP/E (2017) 32.5x\n% of sell-side rated Buy 14.3%\nShort interest % of float 10.30%\nSource: Bloomberg and BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates\n14 Top 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017\nTax Policy: TRIP has a ~25% tax rate. Trump’s tax plan calls for a reduction in the\nbusiness tax rate from 35% to 15%, with elimination of most corporate tax\ndeductions/credits (except for the R&D credit). While it’s unclear what elements of the\ntax plan will eventually be executed, Trump’s intent is clear and we believe companies\nwith the highest tax rate have the most to gain. We see less incremental benefit to\nmany of the global companies who already enjoy optimized tax rates (22% average tax\nrate across our coverage), but many companies will have more incentive to bring back\nIntl profits for buybacks with lower US tax rates.\nCatalysts: 4Q’16 Earnings (early February) will feature initial 2017 guidance. TripAdvisor\nnoted on the 3Q’16 earnings call that 2017 EBITDA margin will decline further from\n2016 levels as ad spend ticks up to re-accelerate growth, however it is unclear how\nmuch margin deterioration TripAdvisor will guide to. We think the deterioration in the\nguide will be higher than the Street’s expectations, driving further downside estimate\nrevisions.\nLatest report: TripAdvisor: 2017 PM Level Outlook\n1Q risks: There is downside risk to Street estimates if hotel shopper growth comes in\nbelow expectations, mobile monetization gap widens, and if initial 2017 guidance\ndisappoints. We remain cautious on IB as an attempt to solve a very large problem: the\ncontinued transition of users consuming TripAdvisor’s content on their mobile phones\ninstead of their desktops. On mobile phones, users are much less likely to transact or\nclick on an ad than on desktops.\nA risk to the short thesis: There has been frequent speculation in the press that\nTripAdvisor may be a takeout candidate in the rapidly consolidating online travel market,\nwith Priceline frequently named as the likely suitor.\nCompany Description: TripAdvisor is the largest global online travel media company\nwith over millions of members and hundreds of millions of user reviews. The company's\nportfolio of web properties attracts over 300 million unique visitors per month\nworldwide.\nPrice objective basis & risk\nAetna Inc (AET)\nOur Price Objective of $149 is based on a 50/50 blend of our standalone AET valuation\n($138, 13.1x 2018E EPS of $10.50 when including share repurchase) and AET pro forma\nHUM valuation ($160, 14x 2018E EPS of $11.40). Our AET standalone valuation multiple\nreflects AET's historical average discount to the S&P 500. Our AET pro forma HUM\nvaluation multiple of 14x reflects upside levers to HUM synergy guidance and to reflect\nthe improved long-term growth profile of the company. Risks to the upside are\nregulatory approval of the HUM acquisition, better-than-expected membership growth\nand lower than expected cost trend. Risks to the downside are regulators not approving\nthe HUM acquisition, lower-than-expected membership growth and higher than\nexpected cost trend.\nConsolidated Edison (ED)\nOur price objective of $59 is predicated on shares of ED achieving 13.0x our 2019 EPS\nestimate. We apply the current group average multiple of 13.5x and apply a 0.5x\ndiscount to reflect a well below average ROE, a slightly below average growth profile,\nand a relatively challenging regulatory environment. This is offset slightly by a lower risk\nTop 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017 15\nprofile investment outlook. Upside risks to our thesis could stem from more favorable\nchanges to the investment and/or regulatory environment in New York.\nDownside/upside risks: ED, like all utility stocks, is also sensitive to changes in the\nmarket level of interest rates. Utilities historically underperform if bond yields rise, and\noutperform when they fall. Furthermore, ED is a bellwether utility and has historically\noutperformed during market uncertainty as a large liquid \"flight to safety\" stock.\nDover Corp (DOV)\nOur PO of $85 is based on 11.5x EV/EBITDA on our 2017 estimate, which would put\nDOV in line with the multi-industrial peer group average. We view the target multiple as\nconservative, as we expect the Street to focus on EPS growth upside in '17, driven by\nEnergy coming off depressed profitability.\nRisks to our PO are: 1) Highly dependent on acquisition strategy, 2) A reduction in\ncapital spending in the oil & gas market, and 3) Weak global industrial production\ngrowth.\nGeneral Dynamics (GD)\nWe derive our PO of $200 using a sum-of-the-parts valuation model. Our model factors\nin 19.5x P/E multiple on 2018E earnings for GD's defense business, which is in line with\npure play defense peers, and 18x P/E multiple on Gulfstream's 2018E earnings. In our\nview, GD's competitive business jet product portfolio and growth outlook in defense\ncould provide near-term and medium-term organic growth. Additionally, the company's\nstrong balance sheet and solid cash generation could sustain dividend growth and share\nrepurchases.\nDownside risks to our PO are: 1) A downturn in business jets, due to an exogenous\nfactor. 2) Given that business jets are priced in dollars, an unexpected devaluation in the\ndollar could significantly impact order activity, 3) We are forecasting a declining defense\nbudget, which would then place a cap on the top-line growth for the defense primes. We\nview the Administration change as a potential ceiling to defense stocks as political\ncontrol, in our view, is a key driver of defense spending. Decline in defense spending\nauthorization (a leading indicator), which in turn could impact treasury outlays. Potential\nbudget cuts to the Navy's fleet could encumber GD as well as a slowdown in\nprocurement for the Army (armored vehicles). 4) Poor execution on defense programs\ncould adversely impact margins.\nHess Corp. (HES)\nOur price objective of $80 / share is based on a 5-year outlook which assumes a 5.5x\nDACF multiple and a commodity deck of $67.50 WTI and $70 Brent to which we add\n$10 / sh for Liza in offshore Guyana. The multiple is based on a finite timeline to\ndelivery which is supported by core NAV.\nThe risks to our price objective are: 1) the oil and gas price environment, (2) slowdowns\nin development drilling that leave production below expectations, and (3) news flow\naround HES' exploratory and appraisal drilling activities that could impact the stock.\nMGM Resorts International (MGM)\nOur $33 PO is based on 11.5x our 2017 EBITDA estimate (implied 10x 2018E EBITDA).\nThis is in line with its historical trading range and supported by our detailed sum of the\nparts analysis.\nUpside risks are: a stronger than anticipated recovery in Las Vegas, improving consumer\nsentiment and its 56% ownership stake in MGM China. Downside risks are: balance\nsheet and liquidity risks proving worse than expected, continued Strip competition, and\ncontinuing near-term softness in the Macau market.\n16 Top 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017\nNorfolk Southern (NSC)\nOur $122 price objective is based on a 19.5x multiple on our 2017 EPS estimate of\n$6.25. We move above the top of its one-standard deviation historical trading range of\n12x-16x given the new management team's move to improve margins, cut costs, and\nraise its ROIC, and as EPS inflects off a volume deflated 19% decline in 2015.\nRisks to our price objective and estimates are the company's ability to derive continued\noperational benefits, a return to significant pricing competition among the rails, slower\nthan expected economic growth, a deterioration to improving service metrics, a heavily\nunionized employee base, inability to exercise pricing power due to regulatory changes\nor legal challenges from customers, external factors (such as weather) impacting\noperations, and the STB installing mandatory reciprocal switching (or open access) to\nthe rail network without proper pricing.\nSVB Financial Group (SIVB)\nWe use a three-factor valuation framework (P/TBV, P/E, DCF) to arrive at our $190 price\nobjective and assign a 2.3x multiple to our 2017e TBV and apply a 21x P/E to 17E EPS.\nOur valuation multiples are both in line with high growth peers due to SIVB's high\nprofitability and EPS growth profile. Our DCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of\n9.5% and a terminal growth rate of 6%.\nDownside risks are a longer than expected low rate environment and a slowdown in the\ntechnology sector and related IPO activity. Upside risks are sooner than expected rate\nhike, or better than expected pickup in the tech sector.\nTexas Instruments Inc. (TXN)\nOur $82 PO on TXN is based on14x FY17E EV/EBITDA, in line with high quality\ndiversified and analog peers trading at 14x-15x, given TXN's high quality business model\nand strong FCF generation.\nRisks to our price objective: 1) Lumpy telco capex, especially in wireless deployments, 2)\nVolatile market share as design cycle times are very long, 3) Increased R&D spending\npressure to maintain an edge versus the competition, 4) Inventory cycles and potential\ndouble ordering by customers that can often create mismatches between real supply\nand demand, 5) Exposure to several mature markets such as PC and other consumer\nelectronics could limit its growth rate.\nTripAdvisor (TRIP)\nOur price objective of $41 is based on 21x our 2018 non-GAAP EPS estimate. This\nmultiple represents a premium to online travel/vertical media comps and in our view\nadequately compensates TripAdvisor for improving margins and growth off a trough\npoint in FY16 into FY17 when the negative impacts of its IB transition peak.\nDownside risks to our price objective are: 1) increasing competition (e.g. Yelp), 2) macroeconomic\nfactors (e.g. recession in Europe) impacting the travel industry, 3) challenges\nto the credibility of online reviews, 4) Instant Book transition puts pressure on revenue\ngrowth, and 5) mobile monetization headwinds.\nUpside risks to our price objective are: 1) improved mobile monetization 2) major OTA\nsign on for instant booking 3) high non-hotel shopper dollar capture and 4) improved\nglobal macro environment.\nAnalyst Certification\nWe, Derek Harris, Andrew Obin, Brian Chin, Doug Leggate, Ebrahim H.

For purposes of this Investment Rating Distribution, the coverage universe includes only stocks. A\nstock rated Neutral is included as a Hold, and a stock rated Underperform is included as a Sell.\nFUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential\nprice fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)\nattractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total\nreturn of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than\nBuy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12\nmonth total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be\nreferenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).\nInvestment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*\nBuy ≥ 10% ≤ 70%\nNeutral ≥ 0% ≤ 30%\nUnderperform N/A ≥ 20%\n* Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.\nINCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays\nno cash dividend. Coverage Cluster is comprised of stocks covered by a single analyst or two or more analysts sharing a common industry, sector, region or other classification(s). A stock’s\ncoverage cluster is included in the most recent BofA Merrill Lynch report referencing the stock.\nPrice charts for the securities referenced in this research report are available at http://pricecharts.baml.com, or call 1-800-MERRILL to have them mailed.\nMLPF&S or one of its affiliates acts as a market maker for the equity securities recommended in the report: Aetna Inc, Consolidated Edison, Dover Corp, General Dynamics, Hess, MGM Resorts,\nNorfolk Southern, SVB Financial, Texas Instrument, TripAdvisor.\n28 Top 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017\nMLPF&S or an affiliate was a manager of a public offering of securities of this issuer within the last 12 months: Aetna Inc, Consolidated Edison, Dover Corp, General Dynamics, Hess, MGM\nResorts, Norfolk Southern, Texas Instrument.\nThe issuer is or was, within the last 12 months, an investment banking client of MLPF&S and/or one or more of its affiliates: Aetna Inc, Consolidated Edison, Dover Corp, General Dynamics, Hess,\nMGM Resorts, Norfolk Southern, Texas Instrument.\nMLPF&S or an affiliate has received compensation from the issuer for non-investment banking services or products within the past 12 months: Aetna Inc, Consolidated Edison, Dover Corp,\nGeneral Dynamics, Hess, MGM Resorts, Norfolk Southern, SVB Financial, Texas Instrument, TripAdvisor.\nThe issuer is or was, within the last 12 months, a non-securities business client of MLPF&S and/or one or more of its affiliates: Aetna Inc, Consolidated Edison, Dover Corp, General Dynamics,\nHess, MGM Resorts, Norfolk Southern, SVB Financial, Texas Instrument, TripAdvisor.\nMLPF&S or an affiliate has received compensation for investment banking services from this issuer within the past 12 months: Aetna Inc, Consolidated Edison, Dover Corp, General Dynamics,\nHess, MGM Resorts, Norfolk Southern, Texas Instrument.\nMLPF&S or an affiliate expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from this issuer or an affiliate of the issuer within the next three months: Aetna Inc,\nDover Corp, General Dynamics, Hess, MGM Resorts, Norfolk Southern, Texas Instrument.\nMLPF&S together with its affiliates beneficially owns one percent or more of the common stock of this issuer.

AI risk is not yet common knowledge either. In\nrelation to the timeline of the first dissident message, I’d say we’re around the year 1988,\nwhen raising the Soviet-occupation topic was no longer a career-ending move but you\nstill had to somewhat hedge your position. I hear similar hedging now—statements like,\n“Tm not concerned about superintelligent AI, but there are some real ethical issues in\nincreased automation,” or “It’s good that some people are researching AI risk, but it’s not\na short-term concern,” or even the very reasonable sounding, “These are small-\nprobability scenarios, but their potentially high impact justifies the attention.”\n\nAs far as message propagation goes, though, we are getting close to the tipping\npoint. A recent survey of AI researchers who published at the two major international AI\nconferences in 2015 found that 40 percent now think that risks from highly advanced AI\nare either “an important problem” or “among the most important problems in the field.””°\n\nOf course, just as there were dogmatic Communists who never changed their\nposition, it’s all but guaranteed that some people will never admit that AI is potentially\ndangerous. Many of the deniers of the first kind came from the Soviet nomenklatura;\nsimilarly, the AI-risk deniers often have financial or other pragmatic motives. One of the\nleading motives is corporate profits. Al is profitable, and even in instances where it isn’t,\nit’s at least a trendy, forward-looking enterprise with which to associate your company.\nSo a lot of the dismissive positions are products of corporate PR and legal machinery. In\nsome very real sense, big corporations are nonhuman machines that pursue their own\ninterests—interests that might not align with those of any particular human working for\nthem. As Wiener observed in Zhe Human Use of Human Beings: “When human atoms\nare knit into an organization in which they are used, not in their full right as responsible\nhuman beings, but as cogs and levers and rods, it matters little that their raw material is\nflesh and blood.”\n\nAnother strong incentive to turn a blind eye to the AI risk is the (very human)\ncuriosity that knows no bounds. “When you see something that is technically sweet, you\ngo ahead and do it and you argue about what to do about it only after you have had your\ntechnical success. That is the way it was with the atomic bomb,” said J. Robert\nOppenheimer. His words were echoed recently by Geoffrey Hinton, arguably the\ninventor of deep learning, in the context of AI risk: “I could give you the usual\narguments, but the truth is that the prospect of discovery is too sweet.”\n\nUndeniably, we have both entrepreneurial attitude and scientific curiosity to thank\nfor almost all the nice things we take for granted in the modern era. It’s important to\nrealize, though, that progress does not owe us a good future. In Wiener’s words, “It is\npossible to believe in progress as a fact without believing in progress as an ethical\nprinciple.”\n\nUltimately, we don’t have the luxury of waiting before all the corporate heads and\nAI researchers are willing to concede the AI risk.

She and Jared, or Jared, but by inference\nshe, too, were in effect the real chief of staff—or certainly as much a chief of staff as\nPriebus or Bannon, all of them reporting directly to the president. Or, even more to the\norganizational point, Jared and Ivanka had a wholly independent standing inside the West\nWing. A super status. Even as Priebus and Bannon tried, however diplomatically, to\nremind the couple of staff procedures and propriety, they would in turn remind the West\nWing leadership of their overriding First Family prerogatives. In addition, the president\nhad immediately handed Jared the Middle East portfolio, making him one of the\nsignificant international players in the administration—indeed, in the world. In the first\nweeks, this brief extended out to virtually every other international issue, about which\nnothing in Kushner’s previous background would have prepared him for.\n\nKushner’s most cogent reason for entering the White House was “leverage,” by which\nhe meant proximity. Quite beyond the status of being inside the family circle, anyone who\nhad proximity to the president had leverage, the more proximity the more leverage. Trump\nhimself you could see as a sort of Delphic oracle, sitting in place and throwing out\npronouncements which had to be interpreted. Or as an energetic child, and whomever\ncould placate or distract him became his favorite. Or as the Sun God (which is effectively\nhow he saw himself), the absolute center of attention, dispensing favor and delegating\npower, which could, at any moment, be withdrawn. The added dimension was that this\nSun God had little calculation. His inspiration existed in the moment, hence all the more\nreason to be there with him in the moment. Bannon, for one, joined Trump for dinner\nevery night, or at least made himself available—one bachelor there for the effective other\nbachelor. (Priebus would observe that in the beginning everyone would try to be part of\nthese dinners, but within a few months, they had become a torturous duty to be avoided.)\n\nPart of Jared and Ivanka’s calculation about the relative power and influence of a\nformal job in the West Wing versus an outside advisory role was the knowledge that\ninfluencing Trump required you to be all in. From phone call to phone call—and his day,\nbeyond organized meetings, was almost entirely phone calls—you could lose him. The\nsubtleties here were immense, because while he was often most influenced by the last\nperson he spoke to, he did not actually listen to anyone. So it was not so much the force of\nan individual argument or petition that moved him, but rather more just someone’s\npresence, the connection of what was going through his mind—and although he was a\nperson of many obsessions, much of what was on his mind had no fixed view—to\nwhomever he was with and their views.\n\nUltimately Trump may not be that different in his fundamental solipsism from anyone\nof great wealth who has lived most of his life in a highly controlled environment. But one\nclear difference was that he had acquired almost no formal sort of social discipline—he\ncould not even attempt to imitate decorum. He could not really converse, for instance, not\nin the sense of sharing information, or of a balanced back-and-forth conversation. He\nneither particularly listened to what was said to him, nor particularly considered what he\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019937\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It was\nAbdullah, the king’s son and later his successor, and he explained that he would\nbe in charge of handling security for the talks. For a few hours in the afternoon,\nwe held preliminary discussions, and I presented our assessment of the\nchallenges and options facing all the different players in the crisis. Then we\nretired to a dinner at which — despite the royal china, crystal and silverware —\nthe atmosphere was also surprisingly informal.\n\nThe main meeting came the next morning. Both sides recognized the\nseriousness of the issues we had to discuss. Shamir began with the one we\nassumed would be the least difficult. Israel was on a heightened state of military\nalert, prompted by Iraqi reconnaissance flights over Jordan, and the likelihood\nthe Iraqis were also hoping to get a look at our main nuclear research and\ndevelopment facility in the nearby Negev. It was important to ensure this didn’t\nlead to an unintended conflict between us and the Jordanians. While the king\nwas careful to steer clear of any detailed comment on the Iraqi moves, he made\nit clear that he understood our concern about stumbling into an Israeli-Jordanian\nconflict and agreed that we had to avoid doing so.\n\nYet the issue of our overflights, if we needed to attack the Scuds, was more\nsensitive. We said that if we did have to cross into Jordanian air space, we\nwould find whatever way the king suggested to make it as unobtrusive as\npossible. We raised the possibility of using a narrow air corridor. His response\nwas not hostile, but it was firm. This was an issue of Jordanian sovereignty, he\ntold us. He could not, and would not, collaborate in any way with an Israeli\nattack on another Arab state. It was Ephraim who tried to find a way around the\napparent stalemate. He suggested Shamir and the king withdraw to speak alone,\nad they met for nearly an hour. When Shamir emerged, clasping the king’s hand\nand thanking him for his hospitality, he turned to us and said: “OK. We’ re going\nhome.”\n\nHe didn’t tell us exactly what Hussein said. In the few sentences with which\nhe described the talks on the flight back, he said that, as a sovereign, Hussein\ncould not order his forces to ignore Israeli planes. But he added: “I assume there\nwill be no war with Jordan.” I took that to mean there might well be an attempt\nto intercept our jets, with the risk that either we or they might end up with one\nof our planes shot down, but that the king would use his authority and\nexperience to ensure this didn’t lead to a wider confrontation.\n\n233\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028081\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

After eight hours in the refrigerator, this\n\ncheesecake still hadn’t set at all. It swished in the gallon bowl like a viscous soup, chunks shifting and\nbobbing as I tilted it under close inspection. Somewhere a mistake had been made. It could have been\nany number of things:\n\nThree 1 Ib. sticks of Philly Cream Cheese\nEggs\n\nStevia\n\nUnflavored gelatin\n\nVanilla\n\nSour cream\n\nIn this case, it was probably a combination of things and the lack of a few simple ingredients that\ngenerally make cheesecake a form of cake.\n\nI was on a no-carbohydrate diet, and I had used this recipe before. It had been so delicious that my\nroommates wanted their fair share and insisted on an attempt at bulk production. Hence began the\nmathematical shenanigans and problems.\n\nBefore Splenda® and other miracles of sugar imitation came on the scene, the hard core used stevia,\nan herb 300 times sweeter than sugar. One drop was like 300 packets of sugar. It was a delicate tool and I\nwasn’t a delicate cook. I had once made a small handful of cookies using baking soda instead of baking\npowder, and that was bad enough to drive my roommates to puke on the lawn. This new masterpiece\nmade the cookies look like fine dining: It tasted like liquid cream cheese mixed with cold water and\nabout 600 packets of sugar.\n\nI then did what any normal and rational person would do: I grabbed the largest soup ladle with a sigh\nand sat down in front of the TV to face my punishment. I had wasted an entire Sunday and a boatload of\ningredients—it was time to reap what I had sown.\n\nOne hour and 20 large spoonfuls later, I hadn’t made a dent in the enormous batch of soup, but I was\ndown for the count. Not only could I not eat anything but soup for two days, I couldn’t bring myself to\neven look at cheesecake, previously my favorite dessert, for more than four years.\n\nStupid? Of course. It’s about as stupid as one can get. This is a ridiculous and micro example of what\npeople do on a larger scale with jobs all the time: self-imposed suffering that can be avoided. Sure, I\nlearned a lesson and paid for the mistake. The real question is—for what?\n\nThere are two types of mistakes: mistakes of ambition and mistakes of sloth.\n\nThe first is the result of a decision to act—to do something. This type of mistake is made with\nincomplete information, as it’s impossible to have all the facts beforehand. This is to be encouraged.\nFortune favors the bold.\n\nThe second is the result of a decision of sloth—to not do something—wherein we refuse to change a\nbad situation out of fear despite having all the facts. This is how learning experiences become terminal\npunishments, bad relationships become bad marriages, and poor job choices become lifelong prison\nsentences.\n\n“Yeah, but what if I’m in an industry where jumping around is looked down upon? I’ve been here\nbarely a year, and prospective employers would think...”\n\nWould they? Test assumptions before condemning yourself to more misery. I’ve seen one determinant\nof sex appeal to good employers: performance. If you are a rock star when it comes to results, it doesn’t\nmatter if you jump ship from a bad company after three weeks. On the other hand, if tolerating a\npunishing work environment for years at a time is a prerequisite for promotion in your field, could it be\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013952\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

At one point in its history, Haiti was a market leader in the textile industry supplying quality products. Currently there is an opportunity to provide sustainable employment for Haitians with the right training to develop an industry to serve as a catalyst to catapult the country out of the stigmatism of a third world country. There is a need for work to be done, such as construction of homes, infrastructure, etc.\n\nHaiti is one of the lowest-income countries in the Western hemisphere. The country has problems with AIDS, crime, drug trafficking, etc. (CIA, 2010). On January 12th, 2010, an earthquake destroyed the capital of the country and worsened the overall situation of Haiti. The total loss was estimated around $11.5 billion; however, the country still needs more time to rebuild (U.S. Department of State, 2010).  The majority of the donor countries worry about Haiti becoming a burden throughout the years without any positive results (Novacek et. al, 2008). The country has both positive and negative sides. \n\nThis business plan includes secondary data. Secondary data was selected from academic, government, news resources or based on extensive research by those with experience in dealing with Haiti. Considering retrieved data, the plan focused on the following aspects: \n  •  Past and current situations in Haiti; \n  •  A critical needs assessment of Southeastern area of Haiti;\n  •  Our plan for investment in Haiti\n\nAfter the detailed investigation of the authoritative sources and critically evaluating information, CEFOTAJ has concluded the following:\n  •  Haiti has a potential for investment in the area of apparel/clothing.\n\n  •  Establishment of our trade/learning school will facilitate and foster future investments within the country via job and economic growth in the southeastern area.\n\n  •  Despite its economic situation, the country attracts foreign investments and investors. \n\n  •  Foreign investments and aid allow restoring the country quicker.\n\n  •  Foreign investments positively affect the country.\n\n\n\n\n\f\nIntroduction\n\n\nBackground \n\nInvestment into another country or internalization is a very important and scrupulous decision that a business has to make. As a rule, developing countries seek to attract investors in order to gain FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) and acquire technology. Mainly, the investors seek for variety of factors when going international. \n\nThese factors include the following: \n  •  an area's business climate; education and training strengths; \n  •  labor unionization; attitudes of local and state governments; \n  •  available incentives;\n  •  community attitude; \n  •  commuting distance; \n  •  transportation costs and  proximity to roads;\n  •  availability of transportation facilities; \n  •  labor productivity and attitude toward productivity; \n  •  cost of labor; \n  •  availability of skilled and unskilled labor; \n  •  availability and transfer of qualified technicians and managers;\n  •  land availability and cost; cost of construction; proximity and access to markets;\n  •  availability and cost of utilities; \n  •  cost of living; \n  •  tax structures and rates; \n  •  insurance considerations; \n  •  financing opportunities; \n  •  banking services; \n  •  social and cultural climate; \n  •  quality of life; \n  •  local and physical infrastructure;\n  •  proximity to suppliers/resources; \n  •  access to raw materials; CEO ownership preferences; \n\nHaiti (Republic of Haiti) is not a very easy place to invest. The country has a very unstable social and economic situation. It experienced a massive 7.0 earthquake and several subsequently large tremors, which led to the deaths of many citizens in January 2010. Currently, the country is experiencing problems with cholera, AIDS, high crime rates, high unemployment, and high illiteracy among other things.  According to CIA Factbook Report (2010), 80% of the population lives “under the poverty line and 54% in abject poverty”. \n\n\fCountry Profile Background\n\n\n\nGeneral Geographical and Macroeconomic Situation\n\n\nHaiti (Republic of Haiti) is located on the western part of the island of Hispaniola (Greater Antillean archipelago in the Caribbean Sea). Haiti shares the island with the Dominican Republic. The geographical characteristics are follows:\n       •  Area: total: 27,750 sq km; land -  27,560 sq km; water -  190 sq km; \n       •  Area—comparative: slightly smaller than Maryland  \n       •  Climate: tropical; semiarid where mountains in east cut off trade winds  \n       •  Terrain: mostly rough and mountainous  \n       •  Natural resources: bauxite, copper, calcium carbonate, gold, marble, hydropower \n       •  Items imported: Haitian rum, beer, cigars, furniture, etc. \n       •  Literacy rate - 53 percent\n       •  Land use: arable land-  20% permanent crops - 3%; permanent pastures - 18%; forests and woodland- 5%; other- 44%.\n       •  Natural hazards: lies in the middle of the hurricane belt and subject to severe storms from June to October; occasional flooding and earthquakes; periodic droughts;\n       •  Environment—current issues: extensive deforestation (much of the remaining forested land is being cleared for agriculture and used as fuel); soil erosion; inadequate supplies of potable water  \n       •  Environment—international agreements: party to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Marine Life\n       •  More than two-thirds of the population live on less than $1 per day\n       •  Approximately 58 percent of the population is less than 25 years old.\n       •  Haiti ranks 154 of 177 countries in the UN's Human Development Index (CIA, 2010; USAID, 2009; The World Bank, 2010).\n\n\nLight manufactures ($165.1 million); fuel and lubricants ($651.8 million), essential oils ($17.8), mango ($10.0 million), cacao ($7.4 million) were the main exports. U.S. (69%), Dominican Republic (10.2%), Canada (3%), and Mexico (2.8%) were the main countries of exports. U.S. (43.8%), China (5.4%), Brazil (4.1%), Colombia (2.9%) were the main countries of import to Haiti in 2008. The country had mainly imported fuel and lubricants ($651.8 million), food ($616.9 million), manufactured goods ($242.7 million), and machinery/ transport equipment ($187.7 million) (CFI, 2009).\n\n\n\nU.S. and Haiti Relationship\nLong-term relationships between the U.S. and Haiti have been developed. First of all, the country has a very good geographical location. Port-au-Prince is less than 2 hours by air from Miami (approximately 600 miles southeast of the coast of Florida). Moreover, there are flights to New York and Fort Lauderdale. Secondly, English is well known in the country. Majority of the Haitian businesspersons speak English and it is possible to pay for the products in US dollars. Currently, there are some U.S. companies, including commercial banks, telecommunications, airlines, oil and agribusiness companies, and U.S.-owned assembly plants are present in Haiti (US Department of State, 2010; CIA, 2010).\n\nThe economic situation was largely dependent on the U.S. and entire world’s financial aid. For example, the U.S. contributed more than $850 million of financial aid from 1995 to 2003 to improve governance, security, the rule of law, economic recovery and critical human needs. From 2004 to 2008, the U.S. provided $600 million of financial aid. Moreover, The World Economic Forum ranked Haiti last in its 2003 Global Competitiveness Report (Global Security, n.d.; CFI, 2010). That is why World Bank Donors (U.S., Canada, EU, France, Sweden, Spain, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, Greece, Norway, Mexico, and Ireland) provided $1.085 billion from 2004 through 2006 to address humanitarian needs (U.S. Department of State, 2008).\n\n\n\nHaiti before the Earthquake in 2010\n\nHaiti had been the least-developed country in the Western Hemisphere since the 1980s. The economic stagnation of the country was a result of inadequate economic policies, political instability, shortage of arable land, environmental deterioration, lack of investment in human resources, migration of majority of skilled citizens, weak national savings rata, lack of functioning judicial system, corruption, reliance on traditional technologies instead of applying the new ones, drug trafficking, etc. (U.S. Department of State, 2008). A variety of the sources (U.S. Department of State, 2000; PRS Group, 2002; World Bank, 2004; Icon Group, 2007; Infomat, 2008; CFI, 2010) identified that Haiti had low trade with the foreign countries between 1990 and 2004 due to the political instability. Therefore, there were a limited number of foreign investors in Haiti. Later on, the political situation stabilized. \n\nGenerally, Haiti had a positive attitude towards foreign investors. There were no economic or industrial strategies with discriminatory effect, e.g. nationality. The Haitian banking system is open to the entry and operation of foreign banks.  At present, there are two foreign banks operating in Haiti: Citibank and Scotia bank (PRS Group, 2002; Investment Overview, 2007). \n\nThe Government of Haiti has made several commitments to the world trade organization in the financial services sector as follows:\n•  Allow foreign participation in deposit taking, lending, guarantees and commitments; in financial leasing; in underwriting services, including participation in the issuance and placement of securities; and in advising and auxiliary services for each of the above-mentioned services.\n•  The tax code includes a withholding tax provision that discriminates against foreign investors (PRS Group 2002, PRS Group 2003, PRS Group, 2005, PRS Group, 2009; USAID, 2006).\n\nAs a rule, investment in “sensitive” sectors, such as electricity, water and telecommunications require special government concession. Investment in the public health sector requires authorization from the Ministry of Public Health and Population. Investment in agriculture is subject to the Ministry of Agriculture’s approval. Exploiting mineral and energy resources require permits from the Office of Mining and Energy. Besides, natural resources are considered as the property of the country (PRS Group, 2009; Schaaf, 2009).\n\n\nHaiti after the Earthquake in 2010\n\nThe January 12th, 2010 earthquake had inflicted massive human and financial damage to the country. The natural disaster damaged homes, commercial & government buildings, cities infrastructure, and took many people lives. The estimated monetary loss is $11.5 billion (U.S. Department of State, 2010). \n\nAccording to the World Bank report (2010), 70% of the total damage and losses were done in the private sector. Therefore, this has lead to the loss of production, reduction in revenues, loss of jobs and wages, increase in production cost, etc. Additionally, the job market experienced 8.5 % of pre-earthquake jobs decrease due to devastation. \n\nNinety percent of businesses are informal in Haiti; ninety-five percent of businesses are SME (Small and Medium sized Enterprise). Business people indicated having various problems due to the natural disaster. Some of them lost their houses and facilities; therefore, they do not have money for rebuilding all the facilities. However, a vast majority of businesses do not pay taxes and do not contribute to the countries’ official GDP (Investment Facilitation centre, 2010). \n\n\n\nGovernment Role in Economy\n\nGenerally, government’s role in the economy is minimal. There are several government subsidies and price controls; however, goods are mainly traded at market prices. Considering the fact that there are over 70 % of imports in Haiti, the Haitian government has eliminated tariffs and non-tariff barriers in order to liberalize trade (CIA, 2010; World Bank, 2010; PRS Group, 2009). \n\nAt the same time, there is a project for creating several trade free zones and exclusion from the taxes of the foreign investors (PRS Group, 2009. \n\n\n\nProject Overview\n\n\n\nDescription\n\nHaitian manufacturing has been well known in the world. As recently as the mid 1980’s, Haiti was known as the staple for baseball production.  After labor unrests occurred, corporations moved their operations out of Haiti to China and other countries. Haiti went from employing 150,000 workers in the textile industry to a current level of 20,000.  Haiti occupies the lowest ranks in the world’s ranking among the countries. As a rule, the country is perceived as politically unstable, being subject to various natural disasters, and having increasing security problems. For example, the political difficulties related to the Presidential election had led to the suspension of funding for major infrastructure rehabilitation by most international and bilateral donors.  \n\nThe Centre de Formation Technique pour L’Avancement des Jeunes du Sud-est (CEFOTAJ) was created by members who trace their roots to the beautiful city known as Haiti’s cultural center to increase general awareness of the dangers facing idle young women and men. The city, a population of 60,000, is considered a major production center of arts and creativity and is determined by CEFOTAJ members as the ideal location to establish a trade school.\n\n In support of the Government of Haiti’s National Action Plan to produce centers of economic development outside the capital of Port-au-Prince, CEFOTAJ plans to ensure Haiti’s future development by bringing much needed training skills for the textile industry to support the creation of jobs to Haiti’s underserved regions. \n\nBased on our target group of attracting over 100 youths with 75 enrolling and being trained for the project, we have formulated a free association questionnaire that we would pose to individuals within the community in order to assess whether the community believes this avenue of job skill creation would be fruitful. The following questionnaire would be utilized to engage the community in open ended discussions about their future and viability of a successful training center:\n.\nSurvey Questionnaire\n\t\n       1.  A job training center in our community would                                     .\n\t\n       2.  Without a job I believe                                     .\n\n\t\n       3.  The textile industry in Haiti has                                     .\n\n\t\n       4.  I would like                                     .to occur in my community.\n\n\t\n       5.  The young people in the Jacmel community                                      .\n\n\t\n\n\n\nThe establishment of a training center would seek to achieve the following goals;\n\n       •  Mobilize the local population\n       •  Workers technically trained for couture\n\n       •  Promotion of couture in Haiti\n\n       •  Establishment of a major element in the structure for bringing the assembly industry into the area\n\n       •  Strengthening of institutional structures\n\n\n\nSWOT Analysis\n\n\nWhen considering market entrance strategy for the business, there were several opportunities and threats that were considered before starting the business or investing in this Haitian industry. The SWOT analysis was based on information provided in the secondary sources (PRS Group, 2009, Schaaf, 2009, The World bank, 2006; The World Bank, 2010; Investment Overview, 2007; CFI, 2010; Economy watch, n.d.; Ozdenli & Bennet, 2007; Icon Group, 2007; Novacek et. al, 2008)\n\n                    Strengths\n\t                    Weaknesses\n\t\n\n    •  Low cost of production\n    •  Possibility to outsource the services \n    •  High demand for work\n    •  Tax exclusion\n    •  Positive legal and regulatory environment\n    •  Geographical proximity compared to China\n    •  Previous experience with foreign partners\n    •  Skilled professionals speak three languages (French, English, and Spanish). \n    •  The country’s population is quite young (43% under 15 years, 4% above 65 years) \n\n\t\n    •  Lack of professionals\n    •  Bad overall situation in the country\n    •  Dependence on the world’s aid\n    •  Corrupted environment  & shadow economy\n    •  Low literacy rate\n    •  Underdeveloped transport, city, rural, telecommunication, etc. infrastructure \n    •  Haiti experiences many natural disasters (flooding, earthquake, draught, etc.)\n    •  Great dependence on foreign aid and imports\n    •  Enormous rich-poor gap (1% of society owns 44% of the wealth) \n\t\n                    Opportunities\n\t                    Threats\n\t\n\n    •  Incorporate the best creative minds from Haitian Community\n    •  Presence of financial partners to support the new investment project\n    •  Haitian Diaspora in the U.S. is concerned about Haiti and willing to help\n\t\n    •  Unstable political situation & Reliance on foreign aid\n    •  Insecure country with unequal access to the police protection and security services to all people in Haiti \n    •  Change in the regulations to less favorable ones\n    •  Corruption, Money laundering activities\n\t\n\n\n\nResults\n\nResearch and Market (2010) research identified the global plan of South Korean company, Sae-A Trading Company Limited, that has built an industrial park and garment making operation in Haiti with the financial support of the World Bank's IFC financing arm and the U.S. State Department. This has provided an initial 20,000 people jobs. Furthermore, A USAID funded Apparel Training Center opened its doors in August 2010 to assist in the training of individuals to rebuild the industrial garment industry in Haiti.  Both projects have received the full backing of the Haitian government as well as the U.S. government.\nThere were various investigations and researches aimed to identify the best areas to invest and market opportunities in Haiti. In order to combine and identify the main trends, the most reliable and authoritative sources were selected and investigated. The list given below provides the summary of the findings:\n\n\n  •  Apparel sector, agribusiness, electronics (US Trade and Developing Agency cited by Fagenson, n.d.);\n•  Apparel, agribusiness, and tourism (Haitian Investment Facilitation Center, 2010);\n  •  Apparel (Research and Marketing, 2010);\n  •  Development and trade of raw and processed agricultural products; medical supplies and equipment; rebuilding and modernizing Haiti's depleted infrastructure; developing tourism and allied sectors--including arts and crafts; and improving capacity in waste disposal, transportation, energy, telecommunications, and export assembly operations (U.S.. Department of State, 2008). \n  •  Apparel, telecommunications, reforestation, agribusiness, call centers (Clinton, 2010).\n\n\nAccording to Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) act, a U.S. company has duty-free export of many Haitian products assembled from U.S. components or materials. Therefore, U.S. companies can outsource labor force from Haiti and experience exclusion from taxes in Haiti. Moreover, they would have less transportation expenses if compared to China, Vietnam, or Taiwan. The HOPE and HOPE II (Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement) Act is another positive legal document for the businesses from the U.S. According to this act, there are additional duty-free preferences for qualifying apparel/textiles products and automotive wire harnesses. \n\nAdditionally, The Haitian Economic Lift Program (HELP) Act that was passed in May 2010 expands the duty-free treatment of imported apparel made in Haiti or the Dominican Republic. These new regulations are developed to attract large corporations and apparel manufacturers, especially from South Korea and Brazil (U.S. Department of State, 2010; PRS Group, 2005; Research and Markets, 2010).\n\nAfter detailed evaluation of the overall situation in the country and methods of community development, CEFOTAJ came to the following expected results indicated in the following sections:\n\n\n\nTraining Plan \n\nThis project’s goal is to improve the living conditions of urban young people. It aims specifically at the establishment of new social structures for youth. This project consists particularly in training them in handling of scissors, cutting of canvas, training in patterns, use of the computer in couture, and the use of specialized sewing machines. The project will be implemented in Jacmel.\n\nA solid structure will be established to work on complete implementation of the project, which will be carried out by CEFOTAJ.  The project will be managed by the administrative committee of CEFOTAJ.   The goal of the Center is to instruct individuals in almost all facets of the textile industry in relation to working in a factory.  Students will be trained efficiently and effectively to the following techniques:\n     •  Handling of scissors\n\n     •  Cutting of canvas\n\n     •  Preparation of patterns\n\n     •  Use of the computer in sewing\n\n     •  Use of specialized sewing machines\n\n     •  Finished product for the international market\n\n     •  Evaluation and adjustment of the finished product\n\n     •  Quality of garments according to the seasons\n\n\n\nThe center has formulated a plan to devise students into three distinct groups to be trained in. Students accepted to the center will be developed via one of the following:\n\n  •  Young people who have no knowledge of garment-making. Their training will last for one year.\n  •  Young people who already have some knowledge of garment-making. Their training will last for nine months.\n  •  Young people who are interested in haute couture. This is a three-year training program.\n\nThe trainees will not be charged entrance fees or monthly payments. However, they will have to obtain the tools necessary for their training.\n\nThe trainees will be chosen on the following bases:\n\n  •  Level of education: primary school equivalency for the first two groups\n  •  Completion of secondary-school equivalency for the third group\n  •  Admission examination designed to evaluate the applicants’ understanding of geometric and mathematical concepts\n  •  Age level: 18 to 35\n\nA certificate will be issued to students who pass the final examination after completing their training. The list of new garment-industry workers will be given to entrepreneurs looking to hire workers. The project has a term cycle of three years at which point a full assessment will be reviewed in preparation for future subsequent cycles.\n\n\n\nExecution Schedule\n\nActivities                                   M1   M2   M3   M4   M5   M6   M7   M8  M9   M10   M11   M12\n\n\t\nMobilization                                XXXX\n\n\t\nRecruitment                                                 XXXX\n\n\t\nTraining                                                                  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\n\t\nMonitoring and evaluation          XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  \n\n\t\nAnnual report                                                                                                        XXXXXXXXX\n\n\t\n\n\n\nForecasted Budget\n\nThe total operating cost of the project is estimated at US$359,731.\n\nThe financing will be obtained as by contributions by members of the organization, grants by philanthropists interested in such projects, companies that specialize in assembly, under conditions that comply with the regulations and bylaws of the NGO, and by international financial backers interested in the development of Haiti.\n\nThe listed prices on schedules C, D, and E represent an on average estimate based upon utilizing marketplace prices for items quoted within the United States as well as the professional experience of the President of the organization.  Schedules A and B were determined based on a blend of Haitian labor rates as well as some influence from US labor rates.  The budgeted amounts for labor are considered heavily competitive within the Haitian workforce.\n\nThe costs, which are listed in USD, are broken down as follows:\n\n LINK Excel.Sheet.8 \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Yair\\\\Documents\\\\CEOFTAJ CHARTS.xlsx!A B and C!R5C3:R32C6\" \"\" \\a \\p \\* MERGEFORMAT  \n LINK Excel.Sheet.8 \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Yair\\\\Documents\\\\CEOFTAJ CHARTS.xlsx!D!R5C3:R32C6\" \"\" \\a \\p \\* MERGEFORMAT  \n\n\n\n LINK Excel.Sheet.8 \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Yair\\\\Documents\\\\CEOFTAJ CHARTS.xlsx!E!R5C3:R32C6\" \"\" \\a \\p \\* MERGEFORMAT  \n\n\fAppendix\n\nBracken, Amy (2010) Recycled trash to fuel Haiti.

Ever since the Carter administration first explored the possibility\nwith Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese counterparts of sending Chinese students to\nthe United States in 1977—78,1 PRC government authorities (like their Republican-era\npredecessors) have seen American universities as integral to China’s economic and\nscientific development. For the first two decades after normalization, the Chinese\ngovernment placed a priority on sending students in STEM subjects (Science,\nTechnology, Engineering, Mathematics). Over time, however, fields of study broadened\ninto the humanities, social sciences, and the arts, a change that has mirrored the shift\nin educational exchange from primarily a state-directed to a private consumer-driven\nphenomenon that saw an increasing number of middle-class Chinese parents opting\nto send their children to the United States for liberal arts undergraduate university,\nand even secondary school education. The net result has been that several million\nChinese students have now successfully matriculated through the US higher education\nsystem. During the 2017-2018 academic year, for instance, a record 350,755 Chinese\nstudents were enrolled in American universities (with an additional 80,000 in high\nschools), out of a total of 1.5 million Chinese students studying worldwide in the\nsame year.* (Altogether, since the late 1970s, an estimated 5.2 million Chinese have\nattended foreign universities.)* Unlike the early years of this epic exchange, a majority\nof Chinese students have become able to pay full tuition, creating an extremely\nsignificant source of revenue for financially stressed American universities and colleges.\n(Chinese pay tuition worth an estimated $12 billion per year, according to the US\nDepartment of Commerce.)>\n\nUS universities and American society have benefited significantly from this exchange,\nand from the presence of international students generally. Chinese students have\nhelped to diversify the makeup of US student bodies, they often contribute positively\nin the classroom, and they have made a real contribution in joint research projects\nwith university faculty. Many have remained in the United States postgraduation to\npursue professional careers, build their lives, and become American citizens—a sizable\ncontribution to American society, to the US economy, and to technological innovation\nand the knowledge base in numerous fields. The engineering, medical, and hard\nsciences have benefited particularly, but so have the humanities and social sciences.\nIndeed, those who negotiated the initial educational and scientific exchange accords\nback in 1978-1979 could never have envisioned how much of a success story US-China\nhigher educational exchanges would become over the next four decades.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020498\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It is a theoretical overview of predictive modeling for robots and does not provide actionable leads or novel controversy involving powerful actors.", "key_insights": ["Emphasizes need for robots to predict human actions and internal states.", "Notes mutual influence between humans and robots.", "Advocates transparency and mental‑model alignment."], "tags": ["AI safety", "human‑robot interaction", "predictive modeling"], "power_mentions": [], "agency_involvement": [], "lead_types": [], "metadata": {"source_row_index": 22348, "original_row": {"filename": "IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016903.txt", "text": "This need to understand human actions and decisions applies to physical and\nnonphysical robots alike. If either sort bases its decision about how to act on the\nassumption that a human will do one thing but the human does something else, the\nresulting mismatch could be catastrophic. For cars, it can mean collisions. For an AI\nwith, say, a financial or economic role, the mismatch between what it expects us to do\nand what we actually do could have even worse consequences.\n\nOne alternative is for the robot not to predict human actions but instead just\nprotect against the worst-case human action. Often when robots do that, though, they\nstop being all that useful. With cars, this results in being stuck, because it makes every\nmove too risky.\n\nAll this puts us, the AI community, into a bind. It suggests that robots will need\naccurate (or at least reasonable) predictive models of whatever people might decide to do.\nOur state definition can’t just include the physical position of humans in the world.\nInstead, we’ ll also need to estimate something internal to people. We’ll need to design\nrobots that account for this human internal state, and that’s a tall order. Luckily, people\ntend to give robots hints as to what their internal state is: Their ongoing actions give the\nrobot observations (in the Bayesian inference sense) about their intentions. If we start\nwalking toward the right side of the hallway, we’re probably going to enter the next room\non the right.\n\nWhat makes the problem more complicated 1s the fact that people don’t make\ndecisions in isolation. It would be one thing if robots could predict the actions a person\nintends to take and simply figure out what to doin response. But unfortunately this can\nlead to ultra-defensive robots that confuse the heck out of people. (Think of human\ndrivers stuck at four-way stops, for instance.) What the intent-prediction approach misses\nis that the moment the robot acts, that influences what actions the human starts taking.\n\nThere is a mutual influence between robots and people, one that robots will need\nto learn to navigate. It is not always just about the robot planning around people; people\nplan around the robot, too. It is important for robots to account for this when deciding\nwhich actions to take, be it on the road, in the kitchen, or even in virtual spaces, where\nactions might be making a purchase or adopting a new strategy. Doing so should endow\nrobots with coordination strategies, enabling them to take part in the negotiations people\nseamlessly carry out day to day—from who goes first at an intersection or through a\nnarrow door, to what role we each take when we collaborate on preparing breakfast, to\ncoming to consensus on what next step to take on a project.\n\nFinally, just as robots need to anticipate what people will do next, people need to\ndo the same with robots. This is why transparency is important. Not only will robots\nneed good mental models of people, but people will need good mental models of robots.\nThe model that a person has of the robot has to go into our state definition as well, and\nthe robot has to be aware of how its actions are changing that model. Much like the robot\ntreating human actions as clues to human internal states, people will change their beliefs\nabout the robot as they observe its actions. Unfortunately, the giving of clues doesn’t\ncome as naturally to robots as it does to humans; we’ve had a lot of practice\ncommunicating implicitly with people. But enabling robots to account for the change\nthat their actions are causing to the person’s mental model of the robot can lead to more\ncarefully chosen actions that do give the right clues—that clearly communicate to people\nabout the robot’s intentions, its reward function, its limitations.

He has paid for\ncollege educations for personal employees and students from Rwanda, and spent millions\non a project to develop a thinking and feeling computer and on music intended to\nalleviate depression.\n\nBut Mr. Epstein also paid women, some of them under age, to give him massages that\nended with a sexual favor, the authorities say.\n\nFederal prosecutors initially threatened to bring him to trial on a variety of charges and\nseek the maximum penalty, 10 years in prison. After years of legal wrangling, Mr.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to lesser state charges.\n\nUpon his release from jail, he must register as a sex offender wherever he goes in the\nUnited States.\n\nPeople from all walks of life break the law, of course. But for the rich, wrapped in a\ncocoon of immense comfort, it can be easy to yield to temptation, experts say.\n\n“A sense of entitlement sets in,” said Dennis Pearne, a psychologist who counsels people\n\non matters related to extreme wealth. The attitude, he said, becomes, “I deserve anything\nI want, I can have anything I want — and I can afford it.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021786\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

His overall\ncontention was that Wiener missed the implications of the digital revolution that was\nhappening around him—although some would say this charge can’t be leveled at\nsomeone on the ground floor and lacking clairvoyance.\n\n“The tail wagging the dog of my life,” he told us, “has been Fab Labs and the\nmaker movement, and [when] Wiener talks about the threat of automation he misses the\ninverse, Which is that access to the means for automation can empower people, and in\nFab Labs, the corner I’ve been involved in, that’s an exponential.”\n\nIn 2003, I visited Neil at MIT, where he runs the Center for Bits and Atoms.\nHours later, I emerged from what had been an exuberant display of very weird stuff. He\nshowed me the work of one student in his popular rapid-prototyping class (“How to\nMake Almost Anything”), a sculptor with no engineering background, who had made a\nportable personal space for screaming that saves up your screams and plays them back\nlater. Another student in the class had made a Web browser that lets parrots navigate\nthe Net. Neil himself was doing fundamental research on the roadmap to that sci-fi\nstaple, a “universal replicator.” It was a visit that took me a couple of years to get my\nhead around.\n\nNeil manages a global network of Fab Labs—small-scale manufacturing systems,\nenabled by digital technologies, which give people the wherewithal to build whatever\nthey'd like. As guru of the maker movement, which merges digital communication and\ncomputation with fabrication, he sometimes feels outside the current heated debate on AI\nsafety. “My ability to do research rests on tools that augment my capabilities,” he says.\n“Asking whether or not they are intelligent is as fruitful as asking how I know I exist—\namusing philosophically, but not testable empirically.”” What interests him is “how bits\nand atoms relate—the boundary between digital and physical.

But others almost uniformly use one word to\ndescribe the chief: professional.\n\n\"I have always been impressed by Mike's professionalism and his leadership,\" said Rick Lincoln, chief of the\nLantana Police Department and a Palm Beach County cop for 32 years.\n\n\"The town of Palm Beach has a very professional police department. We all consider Mike to be our peer and a\nman of integrity.\"\n\nJuno Beach Police Chief H.C. Clark Il agreed. Although he doesn't know Reiter well, he has met with him on\ncountywide law enforcement issues. \"I've never seen him lose his cool. I've never seen anything but a\nprofessional demeanor from him.\"\n\nReiter joined the Palm Beach Police Department in 1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year patrol job at the University\nof Pittsburgh. His personnel jacket shows consistently excellent job evaluations.\n\nPosh Palm Beach is no hotbed of crime, and in his first year on the job, a resident confined to his home with a\nsick child thanked Reiter for delivering a few Cokes to the house. Reiter refused payment for the beverages.\nAnother resident thanked Reiter for shutting off his car's headlights in his driveway, saying a valet must have\nbeen at fault.\n\nReiter worked everything from road patrol to organized crime, vice and narcotics. And he's no novice at\ninvestigations involving the island's rich and famous. He was the lead detective probing the drug overdose\ndeath of David Kennedy in 1984. He also was one of the officers who worked the investigation of William\nKennedy Smith, who was charged in 1991 — and later acquitted — with raping a woman at the Kennedy\nfamily compound in Palm Beach.\n\nReiter, who has a master's degree in human resource development from Palm Beach Atlantic University, also\nhas attended the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Va., and management courses at Harvard.

Reiter makes more than $144,000 as\nthe town's top cop. Elwell thinks he's worth it.\n\n\"He's very businesslike, very straightforward. He's not easily agitated or flamboyant.

Edwards’\nattorney responded by stating that based on “sworn testimony and private interviews” he had\n“placed [Dershowitz] in the presence of Jeffrey Epstein on multiple occasions... when Jeffrey\nEpstein was in the company of underage females subsequently identified as victims.” (DE 291 at\n13, 14.) Again, no allegations were made at that time by Edwards’ attorney, or by anyone else,\nthat Prof. Dershowitz engaged in any inappropriate conduct or witnessed any inappropriate\nconduct related to Jeffrey Epstein and underage females.

These models map linguistic symbols to concepts, and relate\nconcepts to each other, but they do not relate the concepts to \"proper\" mental representations of what objects\nand processes look like and how they interact.

Personal favorites: (1)\nAthleta carries excellent, light, quick-dry clothing that hold up well to sports but still look very\nfashionable. Skorts are a must for looking feminine but being fully covered for hiking and steep pyramid\nsteps—you know what I mean, ladies! Just a note, a slightly longer length will serve you well in a lot of\ncountries, as well as tankini tops and swim skirts for swimming. (2) Fresh & Go toothbrush is simple to\nuse. (3) Marsona sound machine for drowning out unfamiliar noises is a must (regularly use with baby at\nhome too so when they hear the sound they know it’s sleep time!). This has been a lifesaver for us on\nmany trips, and we now use it regularly at home for better sleep. No more changing hotels midtrip to\navoid noise. AND, I know we have to travel light, but with baby a lot of things are nonnegotiable. These\nmake for smoother sailing: (1) Peanut shell sling in black fleece—it’s more comfy than the cotton and\nyou can pop baby in and out wherever you are, from birth to 35 Ibs. I never take mine off, it’s part of my\noutfit; (2) Peapod plus portable tent—this is baby’s main bed at home and travel so baby has the same\nsleep place everywhere we go, and the flaps give all travel parties privacy— great from small babies to\nfive-year-olds. I can still jam this onto a little wheeled carry-on and pack mine and baby’s minimal\nclothing around it; (3) Go Go Kidz TravelMate (great for wheeling car seat up to the gate for gate check\nor use on plane); (4) Britax Diplomat car seat is small but kids can use it from birth to approx. four years\nold.\n\nMake sure the wheeled carry-on bag you get is one size smaller than the allowed carry-on size so you\ndon’t get bumped to check the bag in if the plane is full. You can always nicely argue/reason/bat your\neyelashes that you will put the bag in your foot space. Also, very helpful to give baby something to sip\nor munch on during take off and landing so yours isn’t the baby screaming from ear pain.

President Bush smiled in response.\nHe said he didn’t deal with “hypotheticals.”\n\nYet any idea of an Israeli attack on Saddam became instantly irrelevant once\nforeign media reports had disclosed the reason for our ill-fated military exercise\nin the Negev. Inside Israel, the focus, and the controversy, shifted to the\naccident itself.\n\nThe foreign media reports of the operation we were planning proved\nremarkably accurate. Some of the details still remain classified, but we were\ngoing to use one of our new “stand-off” weapons systems: a camera-guided\nmissile that could be fired from a considerable distance away and, in\ncoordination with one of the Sayeret Matkal soldiers nearer in, maneuvered in\nfor the strike. After months of planning and intelligence work, we were\nconfident that we’d found a way to get the sayeret unit into Iraq, target Saddam\nat an event we knew he would be attending, isolate and kill him with minimal\ndanger of any other casualties, and get our unit out safely again. The Negev\nexercise was a run-through of the entire operation. It lasted nearly 48 hours. And\nit culminated in a simulation of the missile attack on Saddam.\n\nI was there as an observer along with Amnon Lipkin, my deputy chief-of-\nstaff; as well as the head of military intelligence, the head of operations and\nAmiram Levin. We assembled at dawn for the simulation of the missile attack.\nWe watched from a few hundred yards away as a group of young Israeli soldiers\nwalked into a wide area in front of us: posing as Saddam” and his entourage.\nWe — and they — knew that this was just the first part of the exercise.

Rev. 861, *865\n\nA. The Crime Victims’ Rights Movement\n\nThe Crime Victims' Rights Movement developed in the 1970s because of a perceived imbalance in the criminal justice system.\n\nThe victims' absence from criminal processes conflicted with \"a public sense of justice keen enough that ... it has found voice\nin a nationwide \"victims' rights' movement.\" © Victims advocates argued that the criminal justice system had become\npreoccupied with defendants’ rights to the exclusion of considering the legitimate interests of crime victims. ’ These advocates\nurged reforms to give more attention to victims' concerns, including protecting victims’ rights to be notified of court hearings,\nto attend those hearings, and to be heard at appropriate points in the process.\n\nThe victims movement received considerable impetus in 1982 with the publication of the report of the President's Task Force\non Victims of Crime (\"Task Force\"). The Task Force concluded that \"the criminal justice system has lost an essential balance...\n. The system has deprived the innocent, the honest, and the helpless of its protection... . The victims of crime have been\ntransformed into a group oppressively burdened by a system designed to protect them. This oppression must be reddressed.\" 8\nThe Task Force advocated multiple reforms. It recommended that prosecutors assume the responsibility for keeping victims\nnotified of all court proceedings and bringing to the court's attention the victim's view on such subjects as bail, plea bargains,\nsentences, and restitution. ° It also urged that courts receive victim-impact evidence at sentencing, order restitution in most\ncases, and allow victims and their families to attend trials even if they would [*866] be called as witnesses. !° In its most\nsweeping recommendation, the Task Force proposed a federal constitutional amendment to protect crime victims’ rights \"to be\npresent and to be heard at all critical stages of judicial proceedings.\" |!\n\nIn the wake of the recommendation for a constitutional amendment, crime victims' advocates considered how best to pursue\nthat goal. Realizing the difficulty of achieving the consensus required to amend the United States Constitution, advocates\ndecided to go first to the states to enact state victims’ rights amendments. They have had considerable success with this \"states-\nfirst\" strategy. !? To date, about thirty states have adopted amendments to their own state constitutions, | which protect a\nwide range of victims’ rights.\n\n® Payne v.

These instances of shaming might\ndeter bad behavior, but critics like Martha Nussbaum, a political philosopher at the University of\nChicago, argue that shaming by the state conflicts with the law’s obligation to protect citizens\nfrom insults to their dignity.'°\n\nWhat if government is not involved in the shaming? A neighborhood in Leicester,\nEngland, has a YouTube channel dedicated to neighborhood issues, including catching “litter\nlouts.” A collection of videos shows individuals caught in various acts of littering, and if\nsomeone recognizes the litter lout, he or she can e-mail the lout’s identity to the neighborhood\nmanagement board, which they pass on to City Council so that fines can be issued and the video\nremoved. In 2008, the Santa Fe Reporter published the names and addresses of the top ten\nwater-using households in the city (first place went to a homeowner who used twenty-one times\nthe household average). The tennis club near my apartment in Vancouver, B.C. publishes the\nnames of people who do not pay their dues. In each of these cases, the activity of the individual\ncompromises the community. In none of them is the state involved in the shaming. Is this a fair\nuse of shaming? Is it effective?\n\nLet’s deal with the latter question. Shaming might work to change behavior in these\ncases, but in a world of urgent, large-scale problems, changing individual behavior is\ninsignificant. Small changes, adopted by one individual at a time, can make a difference in a\n\nproblem only when the problem is small or there is lots of time to solve it (for instance, in\n\n‘0M.

L. Rev. 844, *877\n\n[*878]\n3. Federal Oversight of Declination Decisions\n\nIn the United States, only the federal justice system provides for a process of administrative review somewhat comparable to\nthose in E.U. member states. Federal law grants victims a right to seek review of prosecutors' decisions within the Department\nof Justice hierarchy, although it also explicitly bars judicial review of Justice Department decisions in this process. !!4\nAlthough decision makers in an internal review process have less institutional independence from those they review than do\njudges engaged in judicial review, they also have a comparative advantage in institutional expertise, which could translate into\n\nless deference to, and more meaningful oversight of, front-line prosecutors.\n\nIn addition, federal law guarantees victims \"the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case.\"\n115 The Department of Justice interprets this not to create a right to confer before charges are filed, reasoning that no \"case\"\nexists until charges are filed. '!® Some lower courts have interpreted the statute differently, however, and concluded that it\n[*879] creates an enforceable right for victims to confer with prosecutors before, and about, the charging decision. One held\nthat prosecutors cannot enter a non-prosecution agreement with a suspect until they confer with victims, and that if they fail to\n\ndo so the court can order prosecutors to re-open the non-prosecution agreement. !!7 A few other lower federal courts have\n\nreached similar conclusions, !18 119\n\nalthough at least two have opposing conclusions.\nEven in its stronger form, this is a limited entitlement, in effect, to an opportunity to try to influence charging decisions. Even\nthe most aggressive federal courts on this point do not examine prosecutors’ good faith during consultations or their reasons for\ndisagreeing with victims. In sum, neither the consultation right nor the right to review by Justice Department supervisors\ninfringes federal prosecutors’ monopoly power over charging from judicial oversight.\n\nfor the court calendar). England had no full-scale prosecution agency until the creation of the Crown Prosecution Service in the Prosecution\nof Offences Act 1985. See Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, c. 23. The Director of Public Prosecutions office was established in 1879, but it\nsupplemented rather than displaced private prosecution. See Glanville Williams, The Power to Prosecute, Crim. L. Rev. 596, 601-03 (1955)\n(noting 1879 creation of Director of Public Prosecutions and describing police as de facto public prosecutors).\n\n7 See Parrillo, supra note 58.\n\n8° Professional police forces did not arise until the 1850s, so victims investigated crimes and arrested offenders. See Peggy M. Tobolowsky,\nVictim Participation in the Criminal Justice Process: Fifteen Years After the President's Task Force on Victims of Crime, 25 New Eng. J.\nCrim. & Civ. Confinement 21, 25 (1999) (explaining that, to arrest offenders, victims could enlist the \"aid of the local watchman, justice of\nthe peace, or constable for whose assistance the victim paid\").\n\n81 See, e.g., Mike McConville & Chester Mirsky, Jury Trials and Plea Bargaining: A True History 25-42 (2005) (describing early systems in\nNew York of judicial or gubernatorial appointment of prosecutors, until the office first became elective in 1847); Allen Steinberg, The\nTransformation of Criminal Justice: Philadelphia, 1800-1880, at 152-58 (1989) (stating that Philadelphia first elected its district attorney in\n1850). Prosecutors as well as judges became elected positions in many states as part of a wave of state constitutional reform in the mid-\nnineteenth century. See, e.g., Ind. Const. art. 7, § 11 (1851); Md. Const. art. 5 (1851); see also id. art. 3 (forbidding creation of state attorney\ngeneral office); Mich. Const. arts. 8, 10 (1850); N.Y. Const. art. 10 (1846); N.C. Const. art. 4, § 29 (1868); Va. Const. art. 6,§§6, 8, 30\n(1851).\n\n82 See Jacoby, supra note 70, at 6 (arguing that American prosecutors evolved from weak to strong figures largely because they were\npopularly elected and tied to local government organization). Public and private prosecutors coexisted for a few decades in some places. See\nCantrell v. Commonwealth, 329 S.E.2d 22, 25 (Va. 1985) (describing the history of private prosecution in Virginia); State v. Stein, 30 S.C.L.\n(1 Rich.) 189, 190 (S.C. 1845) (affirming that private individuals may file criminal or civil actions for the same offense but must elect the\nform before trial); Corley v. Williams, 17 S.C.L. (1 Bail.) 588, 588-89 (S.C. 1830) (providing an example of private prosecution).\nPennsylvania and New York relied heavily on private prosecutors for criminal law enforcement before 1850. See Stewart v. Sonneborn, 98\nU.S. 187, 198 (1879) (Bradley, J., dissenting) (\"Every man in the community, if he has probable cause for prosecuting another, has a perfect\nright, by law, to institute such prosecution, subject only, in the case of private prosecutions, to the penalty of paying the costs if he fails in his\n\nsuit.\"); McConville & Mirsky, supra note 81 (describing New York courts with private prosecutors and, prior to 1847, judicial or\ngubermatorial appointments of public prosecutors); Steinberg, supra note 81, at 24-69, 152-57 (describing private prosecutions, screened by\naldermen acting as magistrates, and creation of elected district attorney's office in 1852).\n\n83 Robert M.

But I sought the advice of a friend who, rather than leaving\npolitics, had just entered it. Colin Powell was now the second President Bush’s\nSecretary of State. “Why don’t you go on the lecture circuit?” he said. The short\nanswer was that it hadn’t occurred to me that I’d be any good at it. But it proved\nenergizing and interesting both for me and, it seemed, the audiences I spoke to. It\nwas also lucrative. I would deliver four lectures over the span of a week and end up\nmaking twice what, until that point in my life, I had earned during a full year. I was\nalso invited onto a number of company boards. I turned down some, in order to\navoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. But I did get involved in an area\nwhere I believed my range of experiences might be relevant: investment decisions,\nand venture capital.\n\nThe result was a dramatic change in lifestyle. Nava and I got to spend more\ntime with our daughters. We vacationed overseas for the first time. We also\ndecided to build a new home, and the place that we chose gave me my first\nexperience of how far I was from being a “private citizen” in the eyes of the Israeli\npublic. When it became known we were planning to move to Kfar Shmaryahu near\nTel Aviv, one of the wealthiest places in Israel, all hell broke loose. How could\nyou, I was asked. I couldn’t resist joking that I just wanted to be close to our\nvoters. Likud supporters were about as rare in Kfar Shmaryahu as panhandlers.\nAlong with Mishmar Hasharon, it was the only place where I'd polled over 80\npercent even in my loss to Sharon.\n\nIsrael had changed dramatically from the kibbutz-centered pioneer society of\nmy youth. Greater Tel Aviv, in particular, was thriving economically, and the\nrising crop of millionaires, whether from traditional business or in the bourgeoning\ntechnology sector, included its fair share of former kibbutznikim. Still, socially and\nculturally, a puritanical streak remained, a sense that there was something not quite\nright about people raised on a socialist ideal becoming personally well off. I\naccepted this. I recognized that I was not just a former kibbutznik. I had been head\nof the Labor Party. And Prime Minister. Still, I did feel much of the personal\ncriticism was unfair. I had devoted more than four decades of my life to serving\nmy country.

It should be as unobtrusive as possible, so that it just seems like another engaging ac-\ntivity, and the results used to tailor the teaching regimen to use different techniques to address\nweaknesses and reinforce strengths.\n\nFor example, with group building of a model car, students are tested on a variety of skills:\nprocedural understanding, visual acuity, motor acuity, creative problem solving, interpersonal\ncommunications, empathy, patience, manners, and so on. With this kind of complex, yet en-\ngaging, activity as a metric the teacher can see how each student approaches the process of\nunderstanding each subtask, and subsequently guide each student’s focus differently depending\non strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIn Tables 16.4 and 16.5 we describe some particular tasks that AGIs may be meaningfully\nassigned in the context of a general AGI Preschool design and curriculum as described above.\nOf course, this is a very partial list, and is intended as evocative rather than comprehensive.\n\nAny one of these tasks can be turned into a rigorous quantitative test, thus allowing the\nprecise comparison of different AGI systems’ capabilities; but we have chosen not to emphasize\nthis point here, partly for space reasons and partly for philosophical ones. In some contexts\nthe quantitative comparison of different systems may be the right thing to do, but as discussed\nin Chapter 17 there are also risks associated with this approach, including the emergence of\nan overly metrics-focused “bakeoff mentality” among system developers, and overfitting of AI\nabilities to test taking. What is most important is the isolation of specific tasks on which\ndifferent systems may be experientially trained and then qualitatively assessed and compared,\nrather than the evaluation of quantitative metrics.\n\nTask-oriented testing allows for feedback on applications of general pedagogical principles to\nreal-world, embodied activities. This allows for iterative refinement based learning (shaping),\nand cross development of knowledge acquisition and application (multitask learning). It also\nhelps militate against both cheating, and over-fitting, as teachers can make ad-hoc modifications\nto the tests to determine if this is happening and correct for it if necessary.\n\nE.g., consider a linguistic task in which the AGI is required to formulate a set of instruc-\ntions encapsulating a given behavior (which may include components that are physical, social,\nlinguistic, etc.). Note that although this is presented as centrally a linguistic task, it actually in-\nvolves a diverse set of competencies since the behavior to be described may encompass multiple\nreal-world aspects.\n\nTo turn this task into a more thorough test one might involve a number of human teachers\nand a number of human students. Before the test, an ensemble of copies of the AGI would\nbe created, with identical knowledge state. Each copy would interact with a different human\nteacher, who would demonstrate to it a certain behavior. After testing the AGI on its own\nknowledge of the material, the teacher would then inform the AGI that it will then be tested on\nits ability to verbally describe this behavior to another. Then, the teacher goes away and the\ncopy interacts with a series of students, attempting to convey to the students the instructions\ngiven by the teacher.\n\nThe teacher can thereby assess both the AGI’s understanding of the material, and the ability\nto explain it to the other students. This separates out assessment of understanding from assess-\nment of ability to communicate understanding, attempting to avoid conflation of one with the\nother. The design of the training and testing needs to account for potential\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013211\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

On the other hand, history has taught me not to fall for it when\nRichard seems unexpectedly vulnerable.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said. I kept my tone light-hearted, friendly. \"You know I love you, right?\"\n\"Do I?\" Richard asked.\n\nI tilted my head at him. Without thinking, I kissed my own fingers, then put my hand\ngently against his face, as if I were about to stroke his cheek. Or slap him. I guess it was a\nway of distancing myself and kissing him at the same time. I think he understood that I\nintended it as an uncertain-but-intimate gesture. But I'm never sure, with Richard.\n\n\"Call me,” I said.\n\"No,\" Richard said. \"You call me.”\n\nHours later, Mr. Ambition brought him up. We were having one of those sweet, intimate,\ndisjointed bedtime conversations. Mr. Ambition was lying back, half-covered by a sheet,\nand I was admiring the play of light on his chest. \"Richard really cares about you,\" he\nsaid.\n\nI stiffened, and sat up. \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But I can't trust Richard.\"\n\"His tone seemed wistful, when he saw you.\"\n\n\"I can't trust Richard,\" I repeated. \"It's always a game with him. Sometimes I think that\nwe have a real emotional connection, but if I try to talk about it or give him emotional\nfeedback, he just ignores me.\"\n\n\"Maybe he isn't really ignoring you,” argued Mr. Ambition. \"Maybe every time you say\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018624\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Our relatively common computers these\ndays have 32 or 64 bit processors. If these 0,1 choices are made in a random\nsequence in which each step is independent of the previous one, the sequential\nprobabilities, _, are multiplicative: e.g. the probability of getting two 1’s (heads\nin a fair coin) in a row are the product of each 0.5 probability: p,;=0.5 x p2=0.5 =\nP1 P2 = 0.25.

The many visitors to the temple stopped and took photos of\nthe passing bride and groom, no other foreigners had ever been married\nthere and certainly anyone wearing traditional western wedding attire,\nsuch a sight had never been seen behind these religious walls, we became\na permanent icon at the temple. The ceremony was done in the Buddhist\ncustoms according to their ancestral accordance, and translated for us in\nour own language. Both Robbie and I were anointed with a blessing from\nthe monk with a splash of water and seven sacramental bracelets, each\none representing another meaning to the longevity of our union together.\nWe signed our names in the Buddhist wedding registry of Doi Cept\nTemple and officially became Mr. & Mrs. Roberts at least officially in\nour hearts knowing the laws of Australia only recognize certified\nweddings, meaning when we got back to his homeland we’d have to\nmake a run for the courthouse. This was our real wedding though, perfect\ndown to every detail. Walking up to the highest point of the temple to the\nbalcony hanging over the edge of a cliff side over looking the city of\nChang-Mai, we knew we had found the perfect spot to recite our vows of\nlove to each other. Providing everything for me and more than I could\never ask for, his vows were to love me unconditionally until death do we\npart, shelter me from all the cruelty in the world that I was so accustomed\ntoo and to be like the bear, because the bear never forgets. Tears once\nagain streamed down from my eyes as he made this moment\nunforgettable. Wiping the mascara fading undermeath my eyelids whilst\ngiggling at my embarrassment | took his hands back into mine again and\ngave him the vows that were the sacred prepared words from my heart.\nMy ears were thundering the sound of a million horses hoofs descending\ndownhill and my heart was beating so fast my words barely trembled out\nof my mouth when I began to tell him how much he had changed my\n\n129\n\nJ Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL.\n\nwhole life around and how I would dedicate my entire being to loving\nhim and only him until | blew my final breath.\n\nI meant every word that I said to him, this was it for me, wanting\nnothing more out of life than to be with someone like him to raise a few\nkids together and grow old on the front porch letting the days fade us by.\nI know it probably sounds boring to most and it would’ve to me as well\nmany years ago but after the life | had led, I had enough experience in the\nreal world for my liking and now all I want to do is to enjoy the\nremaining days of my life for what it is...a simple and satisfying\nexistence. Our day was so special but not only to us, even too the Monk\nthat married us. Upon our descent down the lifts he asked if he could take\na photo with the bride and groom in front of their symbolic liberty bell\nsignifying the union between east and west. It represented a lot for us too,\nit was the commencement of a new life together and just the beginning of\nbattling each other’s past demons together.\n\nKissing the bridal party goodbye, who were just the local girls I had\nmet on some of our many nights out of having fun. | threw my arranged\nbouquet of Thailand’s white wedding floras mixed with colorful orchids\nto the screaming Thai women behind me and we were given one last\ntradition to take with us, the release of caged doves. It was such an\nincredible gesture, especially for me. Symbolizing their freedom as well\nas mine I opened the cage’s door to let them free to decide our own fates.\nAs the wings on the birds began to spread open and they took their final\ndecent into the blue skies granting themselves freedom | knew mine had\nfinally come too. The relevance of watching them fly away and how I had\nperceived my own day of marriage related to the identical feeling of\nfleeing an entrapment of my own kind. | was liberated from the bounds of\nslavery I had come to know over the many years I had spent with my fair\nshare of greedy perverted old men only to have serendipity mend my\nscars with the powerful healing of what true love has to endeavor on.\n\nAs customary in the romance novels I had read as a young girl he\npicked me up in the hallway before our hotel suite and carried me over\nthe threshold, poufy dress and all. My arms were tightly squeezed around\nhis neck never once taking my eyes off of him until he revealed yet\nanother sweet surprise. Besides the cleaners tiding up my room while we\nwere gone they were also given instructions by none other than the groom\nhimself to pick the petals off the stems of red roses to place on our bed in\nthe shape of a giant heart. The rose petals led the way to where we\nconsummated our love physically and it was undeniably the first time in\nmy life I had really ever been made love too. Hours had passed by before\nwe thought about anything else besides one another’s words of arousal,\ntantalizing touches, and lingering kisses.

Since the negotiations with the Palestinians were stuck in\nneutral, I was under increasing pressure from within Labor to pull out of Bibi’s\ngovernment. What on earth was the point of staying, they asked. All I was doing,\nfrom their perspective, was giving Bibi political cover for abandoning any serious\neffort to get a peace agreement. Their argument was entirely reasonable. My\nfrustration was that, due to the need for military secrecy, the counter-argument was\nimpossible for me to make: that I felt I had a responsibility to stay at a time when\nthere remained a real possibility Israel might need to take military action against\nIran. To a mix of consternation and anger among many Labor colleagues, I ended\nup taking what seemed to me the only realistic option. In January 2011, I left the\nLabor Party. With three other of our ministers in the government — who were, of\ncourse, aware of the ongoing Iran discussions — I set up a new “centrist, Zionist”\nparty called Ha’Atzmaut, or Independence. We remained in Bibi’s government.\n\nMy main focus was now on the Americans. In order to secure the “international\nlegitimacy” any Israeli attack required, we had to win at least their understanding\nthat we might feel it necessary to act. Fortunately, I had built up a good\nrelationship with the key figures in the Obama administration. That had not always\nbeen easy, given the tension between the Americans and Bibi. That wasn’t just\nbecause of the deadlock in the peace process, still a priority for President Obama.\nThere were other complications. Ever since the initial pressure for a settlement\nfreeze, right-wing politicians and commentators, and Bibi himself, had taken to\nportraying President Obama as fundamentally unsympathetic to Israel. After the\nRepublicans’ victory in the mid-term Congressional elections in November 2010,\nBibi went a step further. He began cozying up to congressmen and senators on the\nother side of the aisle. This overt meddling in the internal politics of our closest\nally was not just a breach of longstanding tradition, but of common sense.\nMembers of the Administration began privately calling Bibi “the Republican\nsenator from Rechavia” — a reference to the Jerusalem neighborhood where the\nPrime Minister’s residence was located.\n\n420\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028268\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

What nation does conduct the confident, creative, energetic an global\nnegotiations of the sort that mark a power with a clear sense of direction?\n\nTaken as a whole, these six paradoxes represent nothing less than the potential\nunbuckling of the greatest power the world has ever seen. And because the whole\nworld is connected to that power, still more of the system may yet be rattled apart.\nWe are surrounded today not only by fish, but enmeshed in a world of connective\nlinks that are the tissue of our real power - and a source of danger. A sense of\ndirection. You have to feel as you look at this rotten, dangerous landscape we've\nmade for ourselves in recent years. We need a sense of direction.\n\n6.\n\nIn response to these challenges, America’s leading figures are now proposing a\nrange of ideas that don’t honestly resonate with much confidence. Really they are\nhaving a debate about if they should use more of the old style of power or less. What\nthey aren’t doing is grasping the nature of the age. So no clear, imaginative and\ncoherent picture of where we might head yet exists. In fact, as you're probably\nstarting to suspect, the very best ideas of our incumbent figures may yet make the\nworld more dangerous, may firmly and enthusiastically pull us into connective webs\nof danger and waste and mis-calculation they don't see. With our Seventh Sense\nwe'll be able to spot and think about many of these dangers in a new, better and\nmore rational way, free from the blinders of habit, but we should know what the\nworld looks like to the blind.\n\nTwo approaches are predominant among the most respected American elites, who -\nas leaders of the leaders of the establishment represent an important group for us as\n\n47\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018279\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Two days in, in fact, I told a television interviewer that the\ngovernment had every right to respond and was doing so effectively. Olmert\nphoned to thank me. When he, like Shimon, asked what I thought the government\nshould do next, I was straightforward: “Do your best to bring things to an end as\nsoon as you can.” I said that Halutz and the other generals would be caught up in\nthe operational details, which made his role and that of the cabinet even more\ncritical. “In any operation, you’ll have an idea about what represents a satisfactory\nexit point. But there will be a temptation, when you get close to that point, to take\njust one more step, to keep going until you’re absolutely sure you’ve reached it.”\nResist that temptation, I told him. I said there was a danger that, before they knew\nit, he and the other minister would be in way over their heads.\n\nIn pure military terms, there were just two realistic choices in responding the\nHibzollah attack: a deliberately limited and fairly brief operation, or a full-scale\nwar. We ended up doing neither. The result was an operation that lasted 34 days,\nnearly twice the length of the Yom Kippur War. Our air force flew 12,000\nmissions, more than in 1973 and nearly twice as many as in the 1982 Lebanon\nWar. Hizbollah fired about 4,000 rockets into Israel — from a stockpile we\nestimated to number nearly 20,000 — and not just at the border settlements but as\nfar south as Hadera and Haifa, keeping hundreds of thousands of Israelis under\neffective siege. More than 120 Israeli soldiers and 44 civilians were killed. So were\nhundreds of Hizbollah fighters and, inevitably, many Lebanese civilians as well,\nwith a predictable surge of criticism from much of the outside world. Only\nPresident Bush and Britain’s Tony Blair steadfastly reminded the critics of how the\nwar had actually begun.\n\nThe one putative victory for Israel was the UN cease-fire resolution that Tzipi\nLivni helped to negotiate in August. At least on paper, it contained a commitment\nto a “long-term solution” including the disarmament of Hizbollah and the\n“unconditional release of the abducted Israeli soldiers, which has given rise to the\ncurrent crisis.” But as Israeli newspapers began speaking to the returning soldiers\nand officers, a picture emerged not just of a long and difficult war, but a lack of\nclearly communicated military objectives, and an often-chaotic chain of command,\nwhich ended up costing Israeli lives. Our final advance, alone, shortly before the\ncease-fire, claimed the lives of some 30 soldiers. And for what, many Israelis were\nsoon asking themselves.

But it is not illegal \nfor White House officials to use private email accounts as long as they forward work-related \nmessages to their work accounts so they can be preserved. \nDuring the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Trump repeatedly harped on Hillary Clinton's use of a \nprivate account as secretary of state, making it a centerpiece of his campaign and using it to \npaint her as untrustworthy. \"We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval \nOffice,\" Mr. Trump said last year.

We actually prefer to separate this into two topics: environments and methods for careful\nqualitative evaluation of AGI systems, versus metrics for precise measurement of AGI systems.\nThe difficulty of formulating bulletproof metrics for partial progress toward advanced AGI\nhas become evident throughout the field, and in Chapter 8 we have elaborated one plausible\nexplanation for this phenomenon, the \"trickiness\" of cognitive synergy. [LW MLO09], summarizing\na workshop on “Evaluation and Metrics for Human-Level AT’ held in 2008, discusses some of\nthe general difficulties involved in this type of assessment, and some requirements that any\nviable approach must fulfill, On the other hand, the lack of appropriate methods for careful\nqualitative evaluation of AGI systems has been much less discussed, but we consider it actually\na more important issue — as well as an easier (though not easy) one to solve.\n\nWe haven’t actually found the lack of quantitative intelligence metrics to be a major obstacle\nin our practical AGI work so far. Our OpenCogPrime implementation lags far behind the\nCogPrime design as articulated in Part 2 of this book, and according to the theory underlying\nCogPrime, the more interesting behaviors and dynamics of the system will occur only when all\nthe parts of the system have been engineered to a reasonable level of completion and integrated\ntogether. So, the lack of a great set of metrics for evaluating the intelligence of our partially-\nbuilt system hasn’t impaired too much. Testing the intelligence of the current OpenCogPrime\nsystem is a bit like testing the flight capability of a partly-built airplane that only has stubs\nfor wings, lacks tail-fins, has a much less efficient engine than the one that’s been designed for\nuse in the first \"real\" version of the airplane, etc. There may be something to be learned from\nsuch preliminary tests, but making them highly rigorous isn’t a great use of effort, compared\nto working on finishing implementing the design according to the underlying theory.\n\nOn the other hand, the problem of what environments and methods to use to qualitatively\nevaluate and study AGI progress, has been considerably more vexing to us in practice, as\nwe've proceeded in our work on implementing and testing OpenCogPrime and developing the\nCogPrime theory. When developing a complex system, it’s nearly always valuable to see what\nthis system does in some fairly rich, complex situations, in order to gain a better intuitive\nunderstanding of the parts and how they work together. In the context of human-level AGI, the\ntheoretically best way to do this would be to embody one’s AGI system in a humanlike body\n\n289\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013205\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

They need to hold votes to vali-\ndate their rule, but they also recognize the risk involved,\nas elections remain a potent instrument of democratic\nrenewal even in deeply troubled societies.\n\nThe events of late 2014 and 2015 include vivid re-\nminders of the power of the ballot. In Nigeria, Africa's\nmost populous country and largest economy, voters\nwho were fed up with governmental complacency,\nterrorism, and graft rejected the incumbent presicent,\nGoodluck Jonathan, and elected Muhammadu Buhari\nto replace him. In Myanmar, a huge turnout produced\nan overwhelming victory in parliamentary elections for\nlongtime opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her\nNational League for Democracy (NLD), a remarkable\nturnaround in a country that until recently ranked\namong the world’s most repressive.\n\nVoters in Sri Lanka ousted their increasingly author-\nitarian and divisive president, Mahinda Rajapaksa,\n\nin favor of Maithripala Sirisena. Upon taking office,\nSirisena immediately overturned some of Rajapaksa’s\nrepressive policies and began repairing relations with\nboth the country’s Tamil minority and the international\ncommunity. And in Argentina, opposition candidate\nMauricio Macri won the presidency by defeating the\nnominee of incumbent Cristina Fernandez de Kirch-\nner, who with her late husband, Néstor Kirchner, had\ndominated the executive branch for over a decade.\nCombined with a victory for the democratic opposi-\ntion in Venezuela's parliamentary elections, Macri’s\nvictory may have been the beginning of a rollback of\n\nLatin America’s populist movements, which had previ-\nously made impressive gains across the region.\n\nVoters in these countries retained faith in the democrat-\nic process even after experiencing hardship after hard-\nship, including military rule (Myanmapn), civil war and au-\nthoritarian rule (Sri Lanka), a terrorist scourge (Nigeria),\neconomic collapse and political repression (Venezuela),\nand economic setback and unaccountable government\n(Argentina). They prevailed despite, in some cases, an\nelectoral playing field tilted sharply against the opposi-\ntion; in other cases, a history of political violence; and in\nstill other cases, apprehensions about what lies ahead\nwhen dictatorships give way to normal politics.\n\nSome of these voters were also rejecting political\nfigures who had publicly disdained the world’s democ-\nracies and drawn closer to authoritarian powers like\nRussia, China, and Iran. They were willing to listen to\ncandidates who talked about the rule of law, freedom\nof expression, and the right to be free of payoffs and\nbribes, and they were unimpressed by those who\nblamed every step backward on foreign plots.\n\nThere will always be dictators and would-be leaders\nfor life who grow overconfident, lose touch with the\nmood of their people, and fail to do what it takes to\nensure victory at the polls, as apparently occurred in\nThe Gambia in late 2016. But the rest can be expected\nto learn from such mistakes and invest the necessary\n\nresources in a false mockery of democratic suffrage.\n\n1.
