Previously, we made the suggestion that\nthe US dollar is on the right side of the Dollar Smile against the majors, but\nit is on the left side of the Dollar Smile against the EM\n\ncurrencies. Reaganomics-Lite should be positive for the dollar, even if the\nUS’ twin deficits could widen. ‘America First’ means that there will be a\nbifurcation in economic prosperity, that economic strength in the US will no\nlonger translate, with the same elasticities as before, into prosperity in many\nparts of EM. (1) The dollar has begun a consolidation phase this week. But\nmy guess is that it will be temporary and shallow, partly because the data\n(ISM and NFPRs) will be sufficiently strong to justify another Fed rate hike\non December 14. The weekly claims data remain extraordinarily strong,\nwhile the second derivatives in the data in much of EM have ceased to be\npositive. (2) Further advances in the dollar, however, will of course depend\non the policy announcements and delivery by the Trump Administration, as\nwell as an apparent lack of an economic strategy in other countries. (3)\nYield differentials have helped the dollar advance vis-a-vis the JPY and the\nEUR. However, I should note that the EMU economies are not doing that\nbadly, though credit demand remains weak. PMI remains well above 50 and\ninflation has bounced away from zero. The main factor — other than yield\ndifferentials - weighing on the EUR 1s the risk that we will see more political\nuncertainty in Europe. (4) I came across an editorial arguing that Mr\nTrump’s protectionist policies would hurt the dollar’s international\nstanding. While this may be a popular view — that the US, as a savings\ndeficit nation, needs a globalised world to finance its external balance —I\ncontest this conclusion. I think it will be extremely difficult for the\ninternational status of the dollar to be supplanted, even with Mr Trump as\nthe President. The dollar losing its hegemonic status has been a popular\nthesis by many academics over the last twenty years — precisely the period\nwhen the dollar’s international and reserve currency status has risen. In\nmany ways, the sturdiness of the dollar’s global status has surprised some\npeople, because globalisation is supposed to lead to a multi-polar world\nwhere the US loses its dominance. That is certainly true for the real\neconomy, but exactly the opposite has happened for the dollar. This is a\npoint I’ve tried hard to make over the years, that financial globalisation is\nuni-polar, even though trade globalisation is multi-polar. Look at how the\nrise in the dollar is hurting, disproportionately, the high-yield and EM\ncurrencies. Further, which currencies might replace the dollar? The EUR\nitself is still in an existential crisis; nothing needs to be said about the JPY;\nChina could not even dare opening up its capital account. In fact, Beijing\nhas just issued even more ‘strict controls’ on overseas investment, after\nexperiencing some USD207 billion in outflows in Q3 2016.

This was not due to\nany inadequacy in their brains. On the contrary, even before the emergence of our\nanatomically modern human sub-species, they were making things like clothes and\ncampfires, using knowledge that was not in their genes. It was created in their brains by\nthinking, and preserved by individuals in each generation imitating their elders.\nMoreover, this must have been knowledge in the sense of understanding, because it is\nimpossible to imitate novel complex behaviors like those without understanding what the\ncomponent behaviors are for.”°\n\nSuch knowledgeable imitation depends on successfully guessing explanations,\nwhether verbal or not, of what the other person is trying to achieve and how each of his\nactions contributes to that—for instance, when he cuts a groove in some wood, gathers\ndry kindling to put in it, and so on.\n\nThe complex cultural knowledge that this form of imitation permitted must have\nbeen extraordinarily useful. It drove rapid evolution of anatomical changes, such as\nincreased memory capacity and more gracile (less robust) skeletons, appropriate to an\never more technology-dependent lifestyle. No nonhuman ape today has this ability to\nimitate novel complex behaviors. Nor does any present-day artificial intelligence. But\nour pre-sapiens ancestors did.\n\nAny ability based on guessing must include means of correcting one’s guesses,\nsince most guesses will be wrong at first. (There are always many more ways of being\nwrong than right.) Bayesian updating is inadequate, because it cannot generate novel\nguesses about the purpose of an action, only fine-tune—or, at best, choose among—\nexisting ones. Creativity is needed. As the philosopher Karl Popper explained, creative\ncriticism, interleaved with creative conjecture, is how humans learn one another’s\nbehaviors, including language, and extract meaning from one another’s utterances.”’\n\n6 “ Aping” (imitating certain behaviors without understanding) uses inborn hacks such as the mirror-neuron\nsystem. But behaviors imitated that way are drastically limited in complexity. See Richard Byrne,\n“Imitation as Behaviour Parsing,” Phil. Trans. R.

The message from China to US universities is clear: Do not transgress the\npolitical no-go zones of the Chinese Communist Party or government, or you will pay\na price. Sometimes the pressure is overt; other times it is more subtle and indirect, but\nno less alarming. Some American faculty members report troubling conversations with\nuniversity administrators who continue to view Chinese students as such a lucrative\nrevenue stream that it should not be endangered by “needlessly irritating Chinese\nauthorities.”\n\nCensorship and Self-Censorship\n\nThe final category of troubling Chinese influence on American campuses involves the\nvexing issue of self-censorship among faculty and students in Chinese studies.*° In a\nmuch-quoted essay, Perry Link described censorship within China as the use of vague\nthreats to induce academics, writers, and others to self-limit what they say; he called\nthis “the anaconda in the chandelier” syndrome.*! More recently, the phenomenon\n\nhas begun to loom over scholars working outside China, and the Chinese government\nhas started deploying a variety of techniques to also encourage self-censorship beyond\nChina’s borders, including in the United States. In some cases, this syndrome has led to\noutright self-censorship of academic work. To cite some of the most egregious examples:\n\ne Denial of visas to qualified scholars and students seeking access to China for\nresearch or training purposes. The State Department estimates that fifteen to\ntwenty individuals are on an outright “black list,” while scores of others appear\nto be on a “gray” list, where denials are less absolute and sometimes temporary\nor limited only to certain categories of visa.

(“I\nsuppose travel with Clinton changed the arc of my life,” Epstein tells me.\n“There were, I knew, lots of obvious reasons not to do it, but having the\nability to spend 100 hours with a former president just doesn’t happen to\nmany people.”)\n\nThe instinctively private Epstein is not just increasingly exposed, but\nclearly curious about the nature of exposure.\n\nI met Epstein around this time. Epstein had become a more and more\nactive backer of advanced scientific research and in 2002 he was taking a\nsmall group of scientists out to the TED conference in Monterey. The TED\norganizers invited various other TED participants, including me, to join the\nflight. A small group assembled at the private plane terminal, most of us\nunfamiliar with our benefactor, and as we headed in the direction of the\ndiscrete private plans we were gently pointed to our ride: Epstein’s 727.\n\nIt is some thoroughly updated drawing room set-up, all of us\nnervously ensconced in this luxury plane, waiting for our unknown host to\narrive—and soon he does, tanned, relaxed, with wide open smile,\naccompanied by three young women.\n\nIt would be unlikely, outside of a men’s magazine fantasy of the luxe\nlife, that you could locate this in reality. Epstein’s attentions, taking time\nwith each of his passengers, seemed impossible to account for. The quiet of\nthe plane, engineered into acoustic perfection, seemed spooky. Epstein’s\nthree companions were witty, poised, helpful as well as powerfully\nalluring—as though stewardesses of bygone times.\n\n(One more thing about this trip: Google founders, Larry Page and\nSergey Brin, with their company still in its infancy, came out to see the\nplane on the Monterey tarmac and, with a few other Googlers, literally ran\nwhopping from one end of the plan to the other. Then they described for\nEpstein, in what I can not now remember as a put on or entrepreneurial\nbrainstorm, a brand extension in which they would market a line of Google\nbras with the Os as convenient cups. In fact, the name Google, they said,\nwas invented out of the belief that men would focus on a word with two Os\nin it.)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022759\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Under\nChevron, where Congress has not\n“directly addressed the precise question\nat issue,”’ id. at 842-843, that\nrulemaking authority may be used in\norder “‘to fill any gap left, implicitly or\nexplicitly, by Congress.” Id. at 843.\n\nEven assuming that the absence of an\nexplicit posting requirement in the\nNLRA is not interpreted as clear\nexpression of Congressional intent, the\nmajority fails to persuade that Congress\ndelegated authority in Section 6 of the\nNLRA for the Board to fill a putative\nstatutory gap by promulgating a rule\nthat an employer commits an unfair\nlabor practice by failing to affirmative\nnotify its employees of their rights\nunder the NLRA. As the Supreme Court\nhas explained, ‘the ultimate question is\nwhether Congress would have intended,\nand expected, courts to treat [the\nregulation] as within, or outside, its\ndelegation to the agency of ‘gap-filling’\nauthority.” Long Island Care at Home,\nLtd. v. Coke, 551 U.S. 158, 173 (2007).\n\nThere is no doubt that there are many\ngaps and ambiguities in the NLRA that\nCongress intended for the Board to\naddress, using its labor expertise, either\nthrough adjudication or rulemaking.\nHowever, the existence of ambiguity in\na statute is not enough per se to warrant\ndeference to the agency’s interpretation\nof its authority in every respect. The\nambiguity must be such as to make it\nappear that Congress either explicitly or\nimplicitly delegated authority to cure\nthat ambiguity. Am. Bar Ass’n v. FTC,\n430 F.3d 457, 469 (D.C. Cir. 2005);\nMotion Picture Ass’n of America, Inc. v.\nFCC, 309 F. 3d 796, 801 (D.C. Cir. 2002)\n(“MPAA ’’) (“agency’s interpretation of\n[a] statute is not entitled to deference\nabsent a delegation of authority from\nCongress to regulate in the areas at\nissue.”’).\n\nThus, even when an administrative\nagency seeks to address what it believes\nis a serious interpretive problem, the\nSupreme Court has said that the agency\n“may not exercise its authority ‘in a\nmanner that is inconsistent with the\nadministrative structure that Congress\nenacted into law.’’’ FDA v. Brown &\nWilliamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S.\n120, 125(2000) (quoting ETSI Pipeline\nProject v. Missouri, 484 U.S. 495,\n517(1988)). Further, the statute at issue\nmust be considered as a “symmetrical\nand coherent regulatory scheme.”’\nGustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561,\n569, 115 S.Ct. 1061, 131 L.Ed.2d 1\n(1995). In our case, the exercise of\nrulemaking authority under Section 6 is\nnot self-effectuating; it must be shown\n\nto relate reasonably to some other\nprovision as part of the overall statutory\nscheme contemplated by Congress.175\n\nNothing in the text or the regulatory\nstructure of the NLRA suggests that the\nBoard has the authority to promulgate\nthe notice-posting rule at issue in order\nto address a gap in the statutory scheme\nfor resolving questions concerning\nrepresentation through Section 9, or in\npreventing, through Sections 8 and 10,\nspecifically enumerated unfair labor\npractices that adversely affect\nemployees’ Section 7 rights. On the\ncontrary, it is well-established that the\nBoard lacks independent authority to\ninitiate or to solicit the initiation of\nrepresentation and unfair labor practice\nproceedings, and Section 10(a) limits\nthe Board’s powers to preventing only\nthe unfair labor practices listed in\nSection 8 of the Act. Yet the majority\nasserts that it may exceed these\nlimitations by requiring employers to\npost a notice of employee rights and\nillustrative unfair labor practices at all\ntimes, regardless of whether a petition\nhad been filed or an employer has been\nfound to have committed an unfair labor\npractice.\n\nThe majority’s reliance on a\ncombination of Section 7, 8, and 10\nwarrants special mention. They reason\nthat an employer interferes with Section\n7 rights in general, and thereby violates\nSection 8(a)(1), by failing to give\ncontinuous notice to employees of those\nrights. It may be a truism that an\nemployee must be aware of his rights in\norder to exercise them, but it does not\nfollow that it is the employer under our\nstatutory scheme who must provide\nenlightenment or else incur liability for\nviolating those rights. The new unfair\nlabor practice created by the rule bears\nno reasonable relation to any unfair\nlabor practice in the NLRA’s pre-\nexisting enforcement scheme developed\nover seven decades.!77 It certainly bears\n\n176 See, e.g., Mourning v. Family Publications\nService, Inc., 411 U.S. 356, (1973) Unlike here, the\nFederal Reserve Board easily met this standard in\nMourning when issuing a disclosure regulation\nunder the Truth in Lending Act, even though that\nAct did not explicitly require lenders to make such\ndisclosures. In sustaining the regulation, the Court\nound the regulation to be within the Federal\nReserve’s rulemaking authority and, in light of the\negislative history, the disclosure requirement was\nnot contrary to the statute. ‘The crucial distinction,\n* * * [was that] the disclosure requirement was in\nact enforced through the statute’s pre-existing\nremedial scheme and in a manner consistent with\nit.” Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535\nU.S. 81, 94 (2002).\n\n177 The Senate report on the Wagner bill stressed\nthat unfair labor practices were “‘strictly limited to\nthose enumerated in section 8. This is made clear\nby paragraph 8 of section 2, which provides that\n‘The term ‘unfair labor practice’ means unfair labor\npractice listed in Section 8,” and by Section 10(a)\nempowering the Board to prevent any unfair labor\n\nno relation to the few examples the\nmajority can muster in Board precedent.\nThe only instance with even a passing\nresemblance to the rights notice-posting\nrequirement here is the requirement that\na union give notice of Beck 178 and\nGeneral Motors 17° rights. However, the\nfailure to give such a notice is not per\nse unlawful. It becomes an unfair labor\npractice only when a union, without\ngiving notice, takes the affirmative\naction of seeking to obligate an\nemployee to pay fees and dues under a\nunion-security clause.18° Beyond that, a\nunion has no general obligation to give\nemployees notice of their Beck and\nGeneral Motors rights; much less does it\nviolate the NLRA by failing to do so. By\ncontrast, the rule promulgated today\nimposes a continuing obligation on\nemployers to post notice of employees’\ngeneral rights and, even absent any\naffirmative act involving those rights,\nmakes the failure to maintain such\nnotice unlawful.181\n\nUnlike my colleagues, I find that the\nSupreme Court’s opinion in Local 357,\nTeamsters v. NLRB, 365 U.S. 667 (1961),\nspeaks directly to this point. In that\ncase, the Board found a hiring hall\nagreement unlawfully discriminatory\nper se because, even though it included\nan express anti-discrimination\n\npractice “listed in Section 8.” Thus, “[nJeither the\nNational Labor Relations Board nor the courts are\ngiven any blanket authority to prohibit whatever\nlabor practices that in their judgment are deemed\nto be unfair.” S. Rep. No. 573, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.\n17 (1935) at 8-9 reprinted in Legislative History of\nthe National Labor Relations Act of 1935, Vol. Hat\n2307-2308 (1985).\n\n178 Communications Workers v. Beck, 487 U.S.\n735 (1988).\n\n179 NLRB v.

In CogPrime they are used as inspiration for slightly different, artificial\neconomics based computational algorithms; but their hypothesized relevance to brain function\nis nevertheless of interest in a CogPrime context, as it gives some hints about the potential\nconnection between low-level neural net mechanics and higher-level cognitive dynamics.\n\nHopfield nets lead naturally to a hypothesis about neural knowledge representation, which\nholds that a distinct mental concept is represented in the brain as either:\n\n1. a set of “cell assemblies”, where each assembly is a network of neurons that are interlinked\nin such a way as to fire in a (perhaps nonlinearly) synchronized manner\n\n2. adistinct temporal activation pattern, which may occur in any one (or more) of a particular\nset of cell assemblies\n\nFor instance, this hypothesis is perfectly coherent if one interprets a “mental concept” as a\nSMEPH (defined in Chapter 14) ConceptNode, i.e. a fuzzy set of perceptual stimuli to which\nthe organism systematically reacts in different ways. Also, although we will focus mainly on\ndeclarative knowledge here, we note that the same basic representational ideas can be applied\nto procedural and episodic knowledge: these may be hypothesized to correspond to temporal\nactivation patterns as characterized above.\n\nIn the biology literature, perhaps the best-articulated modern theories championing the cell\nassembly view are those of Gunther Palm [Pal&82, HAGO7] and Susan Greenfield [SF05, CSGO7].\nPalm focuses on the dynamics of the formation and interaction assemblies of cortical columns.\nGreenfield argues that each concept has a core cell assembly, and that when the concept rises\nto the focus of attention, it recruits a number of other neurons beyond its core characteristic\nassembly into a “transient ensemble.”!\n\nIt’s worth noting that there may be multiple redundant assemblies representing the same\nconcept — and potentially recruiting similar transient assemblies when highly activated. The\nimportance of repeated, slightly varied copies of the same subnetwork has been emphasized by\nEdelman [Ede93] among other neural theorists.\n\n1 The larger an ensemble is, she suggests, the more vivid it is as a conscious experience; an hypothesis that\naccords well with the hypothesis made in [Goe06b] that a more informationally intense pattern corresponds to\na more intensely conscious quale — but we don’t need to digress extensively onto matters of consciousness for\nthe present purposes.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013173\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It triggers its pursuit function,\nwhich consists of the simplest possible rules. First, move in a random direction. If the\nscent increases, continue moving in that direction. If the scent decreases, move in the\nopposite direction. If the scent is lost, move sideways until a scent is picked up again.\nRepeat until contact with the target is achieved.\n\nThe plume of my scent is densest next to me and disperses as it spreads, an\ninvisible fog of particles exuded from my skin that moves like smoke with the wind. The\ncloser to my skin, the higher the particle density; the farther away, the lower. This\ndecrease 1s called a gradient, which describes any gradual transition from one level to\nanother one—as opposed to a “step function,” which describes a discrete change.\n\nOnce the mosquito follows this gradient to its source using its simple algorithm, it\nlands on my skin, which it senses with the heat detectors in its feet, which are attuned to\nanother gradient—temperature. It then pushes its needle-shaped proboscis through the\nsurface, where a third set of sensors in the tip detect yet another gradient, that of blood\ndensity. This flexible needle wriggles around under my skin until the scent of blood\nsteers it to a capillary, which it punctures. Then my blood begins to flow into the\nmosquito. Mission accomplished. Ouch.\n\nWhat seems like the powerful radar of insects in the dark, with blood-seeking\nintelligence inexplicable for such tiny brains, is actually just a sensitive nose with almost\nno intelligence at all. Mosquitoes are closer to plants that follow the sun than to guided\nmissiles. Yet by applying this simple “follow your nose” rule quite literally, they can\ntravel through a house to find you, slip through cracks in a screen door, even zero in on\nthe tiny strip of skin you left exposed between hat and shirt collar. It’s just a random\nwalk, combined with flexible wings and legs that let the insect bounce off obstacles, and\nan instinct to descend a chemical gradient.\n\nBut “gradient descent” is much more than bug navigation.

Water flows along a gravity gradient downhill, and your body lives\non chemical solutions flowing across cell membranes from high concentration to\n\nlow. Every action in the universe 1s driven by some gradient drive, from the movement\nof the planets around gravity gradients to the joining of atoms along electric-charge\ngradients to form molecules. Our own urges, such as hunger and sleepiness, are driven\nby electro-chemical gradients in our bodies. And our brain’s functions, the electrical\nsignals moving along ion channels in the synapses between our neurons, are simply\natoms and electrons flowing “downhill” along yet more electrical and chemical gradients.\n\n104\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016324\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

When the House and Senate Intelligence ©\nCommittees asked the NSA how many documents Snowden took,\nthe NSA could not come up with a definitive number despite having\nemployed a world-class team of experts to reconstruct the crime.

Ping An & CICC are the 2 H shares that operate in the middle of Alibaba, Tencent, Lufax. \nA. The chart below represents a deep dive we did on the new world of Chinese banking. Companies \nlike Zhong An, WeBank and Lufax will grow dramatically and will take advantage of (as well as \nsupport) the massive worlds of Alibaba and Tencent. Together, Alibaba and Tencent have market cap \nof $500 bn. Popping up in many of these areas of overlap are Ping An and CICC. They are \nstrategically placed to make great strides in China. This is slowly being recognized in the case of Ping \nAN (See Page 8 of attached PPT). Ping An's market cap is $97 bn. It is connected to Zhong An.. It \nowns 44% of Lufax. And some if its management were the very ones that started WeBank. It is \nperfectly positioned for the coming boom in new banking. It has the best combined ROA and ROE \nglobally and its P/E of 10x is trading on a 50% discount to the global averages. Why is Ping An \ntrading at a discount to AIA? BUY PING AN -- SELL AIA.. \nB. The other company which has the best return on capital of any broker dealer -- and is also  \npositioned nicely for the coming boom in the new era of banking in China -- is CICC. CICC and CDH \n(a CICC breakaway) both invested in Zhong An and Lufax. CICC has vision and a proven track record. \nYet it has been a laggard. This is a top pick for H shares for China in 2017. The other bank with great \nvision in this area is CCB, which has invested in Ant Financial. BUY H shares CCB and CICC. (See \nattached PPT for portfolios and China fintech details). \nC. IPOs in 2017. I think Zhong An will be a surprise for 2017 in the Hong Kong market. Its market \ncap is expected to be $10 bn and it has interesting potential in so many areas of insurance. It \nremains an insurance company whose marginal cost of a new customer is zero. It has a talented \nteam of 900 engineers and has new Al and blockchain divisions. It is rolling out an impressive array \nof products including corporate solutions for insurance and investment plans. Lufax CEO Greg Gibb \nmade a big splash at the Finnovasia (Schulte Research co-sponsored it) in Hong Kong last month. \nThe company is a diversified financial conglomerate akin to \"Schwab meets etrade and Fidelity\" --\nonly 25 years ago. It needs an IPO north of $25 bn in order for the private equity partners to make \nmoney. Lastly, Ant Financial will come to the market for a $60 bn IPO in 2017 -- also in Hong Kong. \nThis is a mothership company that goes to the heart of China's system. Its early investors are CIC, \nCDB, CCB, China Life and other vital organs of the system. It will not be allowed to fail. There are \nsome questions about whether to own this through Alibaba, since Alibaba will own 33% of Ant post \nIPO. I'm in this camp. Buy Alibaba on this pullback. (See attached PPT for the full China Fintech \nReport). \n2. Koch Industries saturates both the offices of Trump as well as Pence. Mega bullish for Russia, oil \nand gas companies. Mega bearish for alternative energy. \nA. The Koch Brothers are not just two grumpy men -- they are a political party. Koch Industries is the \nsecond biggest private company in the US after Cargill. They operate public and secretive political \nentities in 32 states and dole out more than $500 million each political cycle to various entities in the \nstrongest places. The political entities employ more than 1,200 people and the amount of donations \navailable to right wing causes varies dramatically but is as high as $750 million per cycle. It is the \nthird largest party in the US after the Democratic and Republican party. It controls the Libre Alliance, \nAmericans for Prosperity, Freedom Partners, Institute for Energy Research, American Energy Alliance \nand Concerned Veterans. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026043 \nB. What do they do with their money? They support right wing Republican candidates for all \norganizations -- attorneys general, Senate, House and state political figures. This is where it gets \ninteresting. Freedom Partners is thought of as the \"Koch bank\". Guess who ran this? Marc Short. It \ncontrols about $250 mn in funds for political activity. Guess who employed Marc Short as chief of \nstaff? Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Guess who then employed him as chief of staff? President-elect \nTrump. Matt Lloyd is in charge of communications and strategy for VP-elect Pence -- he came from \nKoch Industries. Governor Pence was a frequent attendee of the secretive semi-annual meetings of \nthe Koch Brothers. Guess who raised more than $100 million for Freedom Partners? Don McGahn. \nGuess who is the new White House Counsel for President-elect Trump? Don McGahn. (McGahn was \nembroiled in the Tom Delay scandal in the 2000s). Guess who had two companies which had Koch \nBrothers as investors and whose chief of staff (Chenowith) came from the Koch world? The new CIA-\ndesignate chief Mike Pompeo. (Pompeo's Kansas campaign received a $900,000 donation from Koch). \nGuess who gave $1 mn to Americans for Prosperity? Education secretary designate Betsy Devos. \nGuess who has written the strategy paper for the Department of Energy transition? Tom Pyle -- He is \naffiliated with the Koch Industries Office of federal Affairs and the Institute for Energy Research. \nGuess who was caught up in a Koch Industries scandal for a petrochemical port project (with a Koch \naffiliated Messr. Henneberry)? Governor Nikki Haley who is UN Ambassador designate. \nC. Advisors are ALL Koch-related. Here is where it gets fun. Former campaign advisor Corey \nLewandowski came from KochLand. Rebekah Mercer is part of Koch and and gave $2.5 mn to \nFreedom Partners. Kellyanne Conway has connections to Pence from way back and is connected to \nSteve Bannon through the Center for National Policy. Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie \ncame from Citizens United. The Director of Coalitions for Trump is named Alan Cobb -- he came from \nAmericans for Prosperity. Daren Se!nick is a transition advisor and he came from Concerned \nVeterans. Others on the Trump team who came from Kochland include Stuart Jolly, Eli Miller, Scott \nHagerstrom and Matt Ciepielowski. \n3. BUY the hell out of Russia -- Exxon Rex is a cabinet trifecta for Koch Brothers. \nA. And there's Exxon Rex. Any contribution from Exxon received money from Koch -- and vice versa. \nRex Tillerson is worth $151 million and is leaving Exxon next year. He seems to have accepted \nsecretary of state position. He inked a deal worth $300 billion in oil and gas exploration in 2012. (For \nthat, he received the highest civilian honour bestowed by Russia). This will be a boom for Koch \nIndustries as the sanctions against Russia are lifted. (Thank you Uncle Vlad for interfering in the \nelections). This will be a boom for Russia -- for equities, FX and bonds. It is clear that sanctions \nagainst Russia will be lifted regardless of whether Russia interfered in the elections. (Clinton made \nthis a campaign issue and still lost!). \nB. Anyone who thinks this will be reversed by Greenpeace or other green organization is kidding  \nthemselves. The Senate and House is Republican. Majority parties control all committees so they \ncontrol the agenda. The agenda is set. These guys are geniuses with the news cycle. And the vast \narray of think tanks controlled by the Koch Brothers (most of them) allows them to control the news \ncycle as well as the opinion pages of newspapers. The web on control on public opinion from the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026044 \nKoch Brothers reaches every newspaper through a large array of think tanks like the AEI and Cato \nInstitute, not to mention the vast array of Koch think tanks. \nC. If you don't like this, tough luck. Life is not fair. This is not going to be reversed. Think of it as \nwatching a science experiment. Bush lost the popular vote to Gore in 2001 and completely reversed \npolicies on tax, environment, Middle East, energy, fracking, birth control, and LGBT issues. Trump, \nPence, Bannon and Koch will make a deal which will be a hybrid of religious right on moral issues and \n\"zero intrusion from government\" in commerce. Republicans already control the Senate, the House, a \nmajority of governorships as well as a majority of attorneys general. It will be very hard to reverse \nthis. And if Trump can deliver jobs to the midwest red states, more senate seats will turn red. Tom \nPyle's list of things to for the Department of Energy's transition team is expressly designed to do this. \nThis includes new oil and gas leasing projects, more fracking, more coal, more LNG projects -- and a \ngreen light for both the Keystone and Dakota pipelines. The working paper reneges on the Paris pact, \nthe Clean Power Plan and the carbon tax. And it is expressly a climate change denial policy. States \nlike North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Iowa, Texas, Louisiana, West Virginia, Kansas and \nothers will come to life again.. Most of these states have small populations but each gets a governor \nand two senators. \nThis report is published and distributed by IND-X Advisors Limited (\"IND-X\").

The mechanism is fairly simple: dirt is obtained from wherever it can be found to \ndiscredit an opponent. It is then \"leaked,\" usually either anonymously or on background, to targeted \nmedia channels. What makes the 2016 campaign particularly interesting from a counterintelligence \nperspective is not that both sides had their own disclosure operations, but that both sides were \noffered the dirt for them by a common source: Russian intelligence. \nAs we now know from the emails of Donald Trump Jr., a thinly veiled intermediary, Natalya \nVeselnitskaya, offered the Trump campaign documents that putatively would show that Hillary \nClinton had received illegal donations from Russian financiers; in the event, no such documents \nwere proffered. But it is a reasonable assumption that Veselnitskaya could not have made such an \noffer, especially in a meeting attended by three other Russians, unless the move was approved by \nthe FSB, the Russian security service. \nA second disclosure operation, this one involving supporters of the Clinton campaign, was more \nlayered. The proximate intermediary was Fusion GPS, a research firm used by the law firm Baker \nHostetler, and the secondary \"cut-out\" was the British firm Orbis, co-founded by former MI-6 \nofficer Christopher Steele. We know something about this sub-contractor from the depositions \nSteele gave in defending a libel suit in London. According to Steele, Fusion GPS not only had him \nprepare the so-called \"dossier\" on Trump but also directed Steele to \"leak\" it to specified reporters \nat Mother Jones, Yahoo, the New York Times, the Washington Post, The New Yorker, and CNN. In \nsome cases, Steele was directed to brief the selected journalists personally. The dirt in these \"leaks\" \nrelied heavily on information supplied by two Russian government sources: Source A, whom Steele \ncalls \"a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure\"; and Source B, \"a former top-level intelligence \nofficer still active in the Kremlin.\" Sources A and B provided information supposedly exposing a \nlong-time Russian FSB operation to get compromising information that could be used to control \nTrump. The idea that two Russian intelligence sources would reveal a long-time Kremlin-backed \nFSB operation bears further examination. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025548 \nMichael More11, a former acting CIA director, casts light on the sourcing of the dirt in the Steele \ndossier. \"I had two questions when I first read [the dossier],\" More11 said in an NBC interview. \n\"One was, how did Chris [Steele] talk to these sources? I have subsequently learned that he used \nintermediaries. I asked myself, why did these guys provide this information, what was their \nmotivation? And I subsequently learned that he paid them. That the intermediaries paid the sources \nand the intermediaries got the money from Chris.\" \nPaying ex-FSB officers for sensitive information? As Steele is no doubt aware, there is no such \nthing as an ex-FSB officer. All Russian intelligence officers, whether currently or formerly \nemployed, if in Russia, operate under the same tough security regime. The selling of secret \ninformation by them is espionage, pure and simple. Selling it to someone connected to an adversary \nintelligence service greatly compounds the crime. Sources A and B (through their intermediaries) \nknew that they were dealing with an ex-MI-6 man who could use their betrayal of secrets against \nthem. The only safe way for A and B to provide the requested dirt would be to clear it with the \nsecurity regime at the FSB. This precaution, a required step in such exchanges, would mean that the \ndirt in the dossier, whether true or false, was curated by the FSB and spoon-fed to Steele. If so, the \nFSB was the surreptitious provider of this part of the Steele dossier. \nThe third disclosure operation involved stolen emails from the DNC bearing on the unfair treatment \nby Democratic Party officials of Bernie Sanders, which were posted on the DC Leaks website. \nPresident Obama identified the Kremlin as the author of this operation, saying \"These data theft \nand disclosure activities could only have been directed by the highest levels of the Russian \ngovernment.\" If so, as in the previous cases, the FSB would have curated the dirt. To be sure, oppo-\nresearch operatives, because of their singular focus on getting usable slime, are highly vulnerable to \nshady offers, but why would Russia so blatantly feed the slime to all sides in a campaign? \nThe United States has a wide array of tools for monitoring Russian intelligence, including the \nworld's most sophisticated sensors for intercepting signals, but discovering the Kremlin's motives \nremains an elusive enterprise because, unlike in a scientific inquiry, one cannot fully trust the \nobservable data. While a scientist can safely assume that the microbes he observes through the lens \nof a microscope are not employing guile to mislead him, an intelligence analyst cannot make \nsimilar assumptions about the content of intercepted communications from Russia. If one assumes \nthat the Russians do not know that the channel is being monitored—an assumption which, \nfollowing the defection of Edward Snowden to Russia, is hard to make prudently—then the \nintelligence gleaned from that channel can reveal the Kremlin's activities and motive. If, however, \nit is understood that the Russians know that a channel is being monitored, the information conveyed \nover it can be considered a disclosure operation. \nIf, for example, a Mafia family finds out that the FBI is tapping its telephone lines, it can use those \nlines to burn its rivals. The Kremlin can also use a knowntapped phone line to its advantage. \nConsider, for example, the tapped phone of Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. On December 1, \n2016, Kislyak went to Trump Tower to meet Jared Kushner and Michael Flynn. According to \nKushner's version of that meeting, Kislyak suggested that Russian generals could supply \ninformation about Russian military operations in Syria on the condition that the Trump transition \nteam provide a \"secure line in the transition office.\" Of course, as Kislyak likely knew, transition \nteams don't have secure lines to Moscow. Kushner responded by asking if the Russian embassy \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025549 \ncould supply such a \"secure line.\" Kislyak then used an open phone line at his embassy to relay \nKushner's response to his foreign ministry in Moscow. It is inconceivable that Kislyak did not \nknow that the call would be monitored by the FBI, since the FBI had routinely listened in on these \nlines for the past 68 years, or that his discussion of Kushner's request would set off alarm bells in \nthe intelligence community. \nIf Kislyak had wanted to hide this exchange from U.S. intelligence, he could have easily sent it \nunder diplomatic cover directly to Moscow, used a secure line, or relayed it in a coded fashion. By \ncommunicating the message en clair, or in plaintext, Kislyak skillfully exposed Kushner's \nincredibly stupid response, which he himself had provoked, to stoke distrust about the incoming \npresident within the U.S. intelligence community. Nor was this the only mistrust Kislyak \ncultivated: the conversations on the monitored phone led to the firing of National Security Advisor \nMichael Flynn, and conversations that Kislyak had with Attorney General Jeff Sessions led to \nSessions's recusing himself from the Russian investigation, which has now driven a wedge between \nPresident Trump and one of his most effective and popular cabinet members. \nKislyak's resume indicates that he is a well-regarded and competent player in the game of nations: \nhe has served as Second Secretary of the Soviet UN mission in New York, First Secretary of the \nSoviet Embassy in Washington, Deputy Director of the Soviet Department of International \nOrganizations in Moscow, Permanent Russian representative to NATO in Brussels, Deputy Foreign \nMinister, and Ambassador to the United States. Nothing in his 37-year career, either during or after \nthe Cold War, suggests that his moves are not aligned with Kremlin strategy. \nBut when it comes to the various disclosures and interventions surrounding the 2016 election, what \nexactly was that strategy? \nIn a report issued on January 6, 2017, entitled \"Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in \nRecent U.S. Elections,\" the U.S. intelligence community concluded, based both on its sources and \nits analysis of stories on the Russian-controlled network RT, that Putin wanted to hurt Clinton, help \nTrump, and discredit the American election. These may well have been motives of the Russian \npresident, but the narrowly focused assessment fails to explain, or even take into account, Kislyak's \npost-election ensnarement of Kushner, or the discrediting dirt against Trump. If Putin had really \nwanted to help Trump win the election, why did Russian sources provide damaging dirt to Steele, \nwhich could have cost Trump the election? Why did Kislyak provide the FBI with information, via \na known tapped line, that could (and did) compromise key members of Trump's administration? \nA wider focus can be found, of all places, in Oliver Stone's revealing, if fawning, four-hour \ninterview with Putin, in which the Russian dictator makes clear that he views American hegemony, \nincluding America's standing and respect in the international community, as a threat that Russia \nmust counter. One way to undermine America's standing is to provide disclosures that can be used \nby its own political factions, and the media, to sow distrust in America's reliability as a democracy \nfounded on transparency. Putin tells the truth when he says that it doesn't matter particularly to \nRussia whether Clinton or Trump won the election: his goal was to install doubt in the legitimacy \nof the process, regardless of how it turned out. \nEdward Jay Epstein's most recent book is How America Lost Its Secrets: Edward \nSnowden, the Man and the Theft, published by Alfred A.

Why would Appelbaum keep\nit secret for more than four months? The same pressure to publish\nwould also apply to the journalists Snowden had dealt with in Hong\nKong. If Snowden had given Poitras, Greenwald, Lam, or MacAskill\nthe Merkel document, or even told them about it in their interviews\nwith him in Hong Kong, The Guardian would have certainly rushed\nout such a scoop.\n\nAccording to a source with knowledge of the Snowden investiga-\ntion, there was no document referencing any spying on Merkel’s\nphone among the fifty-eight thousand documents on the thumb\ndrive that Snowden had given to Poitras and Greenwald in Hong\nKong. That absence would explain why Poitras had to send a text to\nSnowden in Moscow to ask for an explanation after the story broke.\n\nFurther confirmation of the absence of this document in the\nmaterial Snowden provided journalists in Hong Kong comes from\nJames Bamford, a well-respected expert on the NSA. In the course\nof researching his 2014 article on Snowden for Wired, he was given\naccess to all the documents Snowden gave to Poitras, Greenwald, and\n\n© Gellman. Bamford used a sophisticated indexing program to search ©\nthrough the database specifically for the Merkel material. He did not\nfind any. He reported that no document given to journalists in Hong\nKong even mentioned Merkel. It therefore appeared that the Merkel\ndocument was provided to Der Spiegel after Snowden went to Mos-\ncow. If so, some party had access to NSA documents after Snowden\narrived in Russia and provided the Der Spiegel authors with the\nscoop. In that context, it might not have been a pure coincidence that\nKucherena disclosed that Snowden had access to documents that he\nhad not given to journalists in Hong Kong shortly before just such a\ndocument was published in Germany.\n\nBamford explored the possibility that there might be another per-\nson in the NSA who was stealing documents. He wrote to Poitras\nand asked her whether the Merkel document could have come from\nanother person in the NSA. She declined, via a letter from her lawyer,\nto answer that question. But because she had not been the author of\nthe Der Spiegel article, and had not been given the document, there\nis no reason to believe that she would know its provenance.\n\nDocuments continued to emerge years after Snowden arrived in\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 182 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019670\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Partnering with TIIC and BRIDGE has enabled Edmond de Rothschild to build a strong franchise \nwithin infrastructure investments, complementing its overall Private Equity offering. Edmond de Rothschild \nhas also acted as anchor investor for these funds, demonstrating its strong alignment of interest with these \ninvestment teams. With Ariane we strongly believe that we should absolutely find a way to collaborate \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026069 \ntogether with you to think and initiate something to serve the future needs of the US in the infrastructure \nfield. \nPlease find attached further information on each manager. This would also be a chance for us to explore \nopportunities of working together in the future. \nPlease feel free to reach out to us if you require any further information. We look forward to hearing from \nyou soon. \nTIIC \nTIIC Group backed by Edmond de Rothschild, is a pan-European infrastructure firm advising on mid-market \ninfrastructure projects across Europe in both the transportation and social sectors. It was established in \n2008 by the 3 founding partners of TIIC Group, Jaime d'Almeida, Manuel Cary and Francisco Mendes, with \nstrategic support from the Edmond de Rothschild Group and Brisa. \nThe aim of TIIC Group is to bring an operational approach to infrastructure investments in Europe, drawing \nupon the extensive management and financial skills of its team members. These skills have been developed \nover many years at some of Europe's leading infrastructure operators and project financing firms which, \nwhen combined with the very specific infrastructure expertise of both the Edmond de Rothschild Group and \nBrisa, makes for a powerful and differentiated investment platform. \nTIIC Group operates from two offices in Lisbon and Paris, providing its team with access to relevant \ninvestment opportunities across key target markets in Europe as well as to leading industrial contractors, \noperators, advisors and financiers in the infrastructure industry. \nTIIC Group successfully raised a First Fund with €140m of commitments targeting transportation \ninvestments across Europe. The portfolio of the First Fund comprises 6 assets located in Portugal, Spain, \nFrance and Poland. They represent a carefully balanced mix of greenfield and early stage brownfield projects \nin roads and car parks. TIIC Group has played an active role in the sourcing and development of all \ninvestments and has made a significant contribution to value creation. TIIC Group believes that this is a high \nquality, operationally secure, cash yielding portfolio of assets which will be of strong interest to potential \ninvestors over the coming few years. \nTIIC has launched a successor fund, TIIC 2, which will build upon TIIC Group' differentiated approach to \ninfrastructure in Europe. TIIC 2 will is targeting aggregate commitments from investors of €300m (€350m \nhard cap) to invest into both transportation and social infrastructure projects in Europe. TIIC 2 will also seek \nto invest, on a very selective basis, into greenfield social infrastructure projects in New Frontier Markets, \nwithin close proximity to the European Union. Given its powerful network of relationships across Europe and \nthe operational skills of its team, TIIC Group will continue to target superior investment returns for TIIC 2's \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026070 \nportfolio of assets. These returns should be in line with the anticipated returns from the First Fund portfolio \nwhich is forecast to deliver a gross IRR of up to 14% and a multiple of approximately 2x on invested capital. \nTIIC announced the first close of TIIC 2 on December 30th 2016, with aggregate commitments of €135m from \na group of high quality and well-diversified limited partners. First close investors in TIIC 2 include the \nEuropean Investment Bank and Edmond de Rothschild, both with significant commitments, as well as the \nTIIC team. TIIC 2 is also supported by a number of existing investors, together with several European \ninsurance companies, pension funds and family offices. A second close is planned in the coming months and \nthe final close will occur before the end of 2017. We have received significant interest from a number of \nEuropean institutional investors, many of which are in the process of completing detailed due diligence on \nTIIC 2. We are firmly on track to achieve a final close of TIIC 2 before the end of the year. \nFurthermore, TIIC has announced the first exit from Fund 1, with outstanding returns. Three other \ninvestments are in sales processes and should close during the next few months. \nBRIDGE \nBRIDGE is an infrastructure debt platform initiated by Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (EdRAM) to \nenable institutional investors to access infrastructure assets with secured and stable revenue streams. BRIDGE \nis a London based second generation debt fund sourcing and structuring transactions directly from sponsors \nwhen feasible and one of the few independent debt teams only investing on behalf of clients. The BRIDGE \nteam has the ability to execute and deliver transactions as efficiently as traditional lenders as well as negotiate \nterms and conditions bringing optimised yield and security to investors. \nThe BRIDGE platform was set up as a new leg of EDR's Infrastructure, Real Assets & Structured Finance Team \nstriving to take advantage of the expertise of the infrastructure sector acquired when the team became a \nglobal leader in PPP & Transport infrastructure financial advisory in 2011 and 2012. \nThe BRIDGE platform raised € 400m of new monies in 2016 and has successfully reached the €1bn mark of \nAssets under Management at the end of 2016. The platform comprises three investment vehicles (French FCT \nand Lux SIF) and is currently fundraising for additional pockets of liquidity: \no BRIDGE I reached final closing in December 2014 with approximately €600m of aggregate commitments from a club \nof institutional investors. \no BRIDGE I Dedicated Compartmentis a vehicle created by a large European institution and anchor investor of the first \nfund with a €250m target amount available for deployment. \no BRIDGE II reached first close in December 2016 with €150m of commitments in order to invest in three transactions. \nFundraising for BRIDGE ll is still ongoing, targeting a group of institutional investors in Europe and elsewhere, with final \ntarget size of €600m. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026071 \nThe BRIDGE platform has a long-term European investment strategy and a mandate to cover all sectors of \ninfrastructure, notably energy, renewables, utilities, transportation, telecommunications and social \ninfrastructure and can execute project financing, refinancing and acquisition finance transactions. \nThe BRIDGE platform currently comprises investments of between €20420 million each, in 17 European \ninfrastructure transactions. In 2016 alone, the BRIDGE team has achieved financial close for 11 infrastructure \ndeals in Europe aggregating ca. €390m. When benchmarked against other similar funds, the investment team \nhas succeeded in deploying faster and with credit spreads well above the infrastructure senior debt \nbenchmark, enabling BRIDGE to become a force in the growing institutions-backed infrastructure debt market. \nBRIDGE's ability to invest beyond the traditional definition of core infrastructure and to structure transactions \nwas a key differentiator when Edmond de Rothschild launched this platform, as part of its commitment to real \neconomy. BRIDGE is innovative in the sense that the investment team sources transactions directly from \nsponsors and is actively involved in the structuring phase, acting as Mandated Lead Arranger. \nBRIDGE comprises a large, international and skilled London based investment team of 11 investment \nprofessionals who between them have arranged more than €100bn of landmark infrastructure deals over the \nlast 20 years across the globe. The BRIDGE team is among the largest within the debt funds universe and \ndemonstrates the Edmond de Rothschild Group's commitment to the platform. \nKind regards, \nJohnny \nJohnny el HACHEM \nEdmond de Rothschild Private Equity \n29 Route de Pre-Bois \nCase postale 490 \n1215 Geneve 15 \nSuisse \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026072 \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

Yitzhak had said no at the time,\nbecause he was worried it would be seen as a de facto border and undermine the\nidea of building coexistence. My view then, and even more so now, was that we\nwould never get to the point of negotiating a final peace with the Palestinians\nunless we could stop at least most of the terror attacks before they happened. Peres,\ntoo, had been worried about “undermining coexistence.” But now, he and the rest\nof the cabinet were so shaken by the carnage Hamas had left that they approved the\nidea of a security barrier.\n\nAt our kirya meeting, hours after the latest bomb had exploded less than a mile\naway, Peres recognized we had to go further. Under Oslo, we had begun giving the\nPalestinians control over internal security in Gaza and parts of the West Bank.\nSince the new Hamas attacks, Arafat had been saying the right things. After the\nfirst bomb in Jerusalem, he’d phoned Shimon to offer condolences, telling\nreporters afterward that this was “a terrorist operation. I condemn it completely. It\nis not only against civilians, but against the whole peace process.” Yet when it\ncame to action, we saw no sign that he was willing, ready, or perhaps able to crack\ndown on the Islamist terror attacks. So Peres now announced that, if necessary in\norder to detain known terrorists, we would for the first time send Israeli troops\nback into areas where control had been handed back. If Arafat didn’t act, we\nwould.\n\nOn the political front, Peres did get some good news: President Clinton, anxious\nto preserve the progress he’d worked so closely with Yitzhak to achieve, organized\nan unprecedented show of international condemnation of the terror attacks. With\nEgypt’s Hosni Mubarak, he co-chaired a “Summit of Peacemakers” in Sharm al-\nSheikh with the participation not just of an equally concerned King Hussein, and of\ncourse Arafat, but leaders of Arab states from North Africa to Saudi Arabia and the\nGulf. The only significant holdout was Syria’s Hafez al-Assad. He objected\nbecause he said the conference was too focused on Israel. As Foreign Minister, I\naccompanied Shimon to the summit. A single day’s meeting was never going to\nend terror. But it was unprecedented in the breadth of Arab engagement in an\ninitiative that, as Assad had anticipated, didn’t just condemn terror in general. It\nspecifically denounced the attacks being launched inside Israel.\n\n288\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028136\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

When they found out that I hadn’t led\nmuch of a normal existence they only probed me with more questions,\nwhich being put on the spot answered honestly. The funny thing was they\ndidn’t seem appalled at all by my statements, rather entertained if\nanything.

Cupping them in\nher hands she moved her lips across my nipples, licking and teasing them\nwith her tongue making them cold and stiff. Next her hands moved down\nto my little white skirt, removing the final piece of my remaining\nuniform. She slid my skirt down my legs with ease, for a moment keeping\non my love-heart panties, so they could both take notice of my apparent\nyouth. They even snickered to each other about “ How cute she still wears\nlittle girl pantie’s” Jeffrey said, and Ghislane joined in his laughter.\nActing as my madam, she instructed me to start by licking his nipples\nand after I had sufficiently pleasured both of them, then prompted me to\ngo down on Jeffery orally while she rubbed her breasts along his body\ntantalizingly. She moved behind me again this time to remove my panties\nand start fondling the delicate folds between my legs. | was still in shock\nfrom the initial degrading blow. I hadn’t even let the reality sink in, it was\nall too much for me to emotionally handle so instead I hid behind my\nfears, which I told myself “I wasn’t going to ever be worth anything at all\nand this would probably be as good as it gets for me” after all I thought,\n\n25\n\nCl Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004158\n\n“what have I been trained up for until now”. Nobody ever stopped to ask\nif | was comfortable or if I wanted to stop, no, instead, Ghislane only\ndirected me to conclude the massage session by climbing up on the table\nto be fixated on Jeffrey, straddling him so he could penetrate me.\n\nWhen it was all done and over with, I was taken into the steam room\nwith just Jeffrey to get further aquatinted, as Ghislane left the room to go\nget dressed. He asked me to grab his feet and rub them not saying a word\nabout what just happened, like it was all normal and accepted. I listened\nto him ramble on about the health benefits of a sauna and the history of it,\nignoring the fact of the matter of his pretentiousness degrading my spirit.\nI figured I had gone too far already, what would be the point in throwing\nin the towel now after I had done exactly what these people wanted.\n\nWhilst we were sweating out our bodies’ toxins, and the steam was\nblasting my burning face I listened to his lessons, entertaining his ego, I\nlet him become my teacher, he seemed to like that. He sounded like a\nvery clever and intelligent man though. Telling me his story of how he\nmade himself an empire of billions from being a middle-class professor to\nan elite financial advisor for clientele with only billions in their bank\naccounts and through his so-called “lessons”, He became my mentor and\nI emerged as his pupil, the teacher’s pet.\n\nAfter the sauna we went to the next glass door beside us where the\nshower was. He turned tap outwards and stood underneath the water as 1\nstood naked and cold from the temperature difference. Instead of asking\nme to join him under the warm stream, like I thought he was going to, he\nhanded me a bar of soap and asked me to wash his body from top to toe.\nIt didn’t stop there I had to massage the shampoo and conditioner into his\nscalp as well.

He allowed the chips to fall where they may and they\noften fall on the head of the current office holders around the world.\n\nProsecuting Wikileaks or its founder for “the crime” of publishing classified information, while at\nthe same time rewarding -- with prizes, access, interviews, and status — “reputable” journalists and\nnewspapers for doing essentially the same thing, would constitute selective prosecution.\nAmerican law, as distinguished for example from German law, generally permits selective\nprosecution of criminals, on the ground that resources are limited and prosecutors must have\nsome discretion in deciding how to expend their limited resources. In order to “get the most bang\nfor the buck”, prosecutors are generally free to pick and choose among the many who violate\nbroad, open-ended and often vague criminal statutes, such as tax, regulatory and criminal\nnegligence laws. They are not free to exercise this discretion in a partisan manner: going after\nmembers of the opposing political party. Nor can they properly do so on the basis of race,\nreligion or other protected categories. But they may select for prosecution the most visible or\nnotorious offenders, since such prosecutions are likely to have the greatest deterrent effect on\nother potential law violators. For example, Leona Helmsley, one of the most famous women in\nAmerica, was indicted for tax evasion on April 15™!\n\nOne area in which it is dangerous and wrong to permit selective prosecution is the publication of\nclassified information by the media. If the government can pick and choose the few it decides to\nprosecute among the many who publish classified information, it will have far too much power\nover the content of what the media reports.** The First Amendment recognizes no distinction\nbetween the patriotic and unpatriotic, the responsible and irresponsible, the favorable or\nunfavorable, media. It was precisely these improper distinctions that were employed by the John\nAdams administration when it selectively enforced the Alien and Sedition laws against\n“Jeffersonians”’, “Jacobins”, and other perceived enemies of the Federalists. It took more than a\ncentury and a half for the Supreme Court to declare that although “.. the Sedition Act was never\ntested in this court, the attack upon its validity has carried the day in the ‘court of history’, citing\n“a broad consensus that the act was inconsistent with the First Amendment”. (I was a law clerk\nwhen that opinion was issued in 1964.)\n\n‘48 The Supreme Court has recognized, in the context of the First Amendment, that a law purporting to regulate\nspeech or press, in order to survive the “strict scrutiny” standard of review required by the First Amendment, must\nnot be overinclusive or underinclusive. See Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn.: “Underinclusiveness raises\nserious doubts about whether the government is in fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than disfavoring a\nparticular speaker or viewpoint... And finally, the Act’s purported aid to parental authority is vastly overinclusive.\nNot all of the children who are forbidden to purchase violent video games on their own have parents who care\nwhether they purchase violent video games. While some of the legislation’s effect may indeed be in support of\nwhat some parents of the restricted children actually want, its entire effect is only in support of what the State\nthinks parents ought to want. This is not the narrow tailoring to “assistant parents” that restriction of First\nAmendment rights requires...California’s legislation straddles the fence between (1) addressing a serious social\nproblem and (2) helping concerned parents control their children. Both ends are legitimate, but when they affect\nFirst Amendment rights they must be pursued by means that are neither seriously underinclusive nor seriously\noverinclusive. See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993) As a means of\nprotecting children from portrayals of violence, the legislation is seriously underinclusive, not only because it\nexcludes portrayals other than video games, but also because it permits a parental or avuncular veto. And as a\nmeans of assisting concerned parents it is seriously overinclusive because it abridges the First Amendment rights\nof young people whose parents (and aunts and uncles) think violent video games are a harmless pastime. And the\noverbreadth in achieving one goal is not cured by the underbreadth in achieving the other. Legislation such as\nthis, which is neither fish nor fowl, cannot survive strict scrutiny.”\n\n127\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017214\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

And then I started\nto look at flight logs. There were -- there were some\nvery interesting things that I noticed on the flight\nlogs.\n\nOne of the things I noticed was when I began\nto, you know, get into this, that, you know, I was\nwondering, well, what -- well, how do these flight logs\ncome into the possession of, you know, law enforcement\nagencies? And the answer turned out to be that they had\nbeen provided by Epstein’s defense attorney and -~- and,\nyou know, coincidentally, I suppose, or in my mind,\nsuspiciously, they were not provided by just any defense\nattorney on this rather large defense team. They were\nprovided by one attorney according to Detective Recarey.\nDetective Recarey testified under oath that the flight\nlogs were provided to him by Alan Dershowitz.\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n92\n\nSo one of the things that was -- was\ninteresting is, Dershowitz has had access to these\nflight logs, and now I'm beginning to wonder, well, has\nthere been an opportunity to sanitize those flight logs\nor remove any incriminating information?\n\nAnd -- and one of the things that was\ninteresting about the flight logs that were produced --\n\nI believe just so the record is clear, that was Exhibit\n1 that -- if we could -- if I could refer -- I need to\nrefresh my recollection as to -- well, I don't -~ you\nmay not want me to look at documents,\n\nIt was either Exhibit 1 or 2 this morning\nduring Dershowitz's deposition which was covering a time\nperiod of January to, I believe, September 2005. These\nwere flight logs that were produced by Mr. Dershowitz to\nthe Palm Beach Police Department.\n\nAnd you wonder why did they stop in\nSeptember -- you know, why stop in September 2005?\nWhat's the significance of that? Well, later on,\nadditional flight logs were obtained, and sure enough,\nwho shows up on an October 2005 flight log with Jeffrey\nEpstein? Mr. Dershowitz.\n\nSo that led to a suspicion that\nMr. Dershowitz had provided to the Palm Beach Police\nDepartment flight logs that, the time period of which\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010832\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

They were under the age of consent in\nFlorida.\n\nAnd so each and every one of those events was\na crime being perpetrated -- and let's be clear, not\njust being perpetrated by Epstein, but by other people\nwho were involved there at the mansion.\n\nAnd so what the -- the Palm Beach Police\nDepartment was putting together was that this mansion in\nFlorida was the nest of sexual abuse of young girls here\nin Florida that involved, literally, in the -- in this\nperiod of time, more than a hundred events that they\nwere able to document of sexual abuse.\n\nAnd when you put that together with the\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n68\npattern or practice that was being revealed there, there\nwere hundreds of acts of sexual abuse going on in the\nmansion.\n\nBut then what becomes -- and this is where I\nindicated that, you know, the answer would continue on,\nThe -- the problem was that the evidence was starting to\nshow that this was a much broader series of events.

For example, we are seeing evidence that --\nlet's just talk about Virginia Roberts since she's\ncentral to this case.\n\nWe are seeing Virginia Roberts being flown\nfrom Florida to New York where she's in the clutches of\nJeffrey Epstein who is sexually abusing her, you know,\nmany times a week.

Out of whatever. It started with modeling as a kid,\nbuilding models. When computers came along, I started\nlearning programming and realizing the computer was this\ngreat tool for making things, making models, dynamic models,\nand behaviors, not just static models. I think when I started\ndoing games I really wanted to carry that to the next step, to\nthe player, so that you give the player a tool so that they can\ncreate things. And then you give them some context for that\ncreation. You know, what is it, what kind of kind of world\n\ndoes it live in, what’s its purpose? What are you trying to do\nwith this thing that you’re creating? To really put the player\n\nin the design role. And the actual world is reactive to their\ndesign. So they design something that the little world inside\nthe computer reacts to. And then they have to revisit the\ndesign and redesign it, or tear it down and build another one,\nwhatever it is. So I guess what really draws me to interactive\nentertainment and the thing that I try to keep focused on is\nenabling the creativity of the player. Giving them a pretty large\nsolution space to solve the problem within the game. So the\ngame represents this problem landscape. Most games have\nsmall solution landscapes, so there’s one possible solution and\none way to solve it. Other games, the games that tend to be\nmore creative, have a much larger solution space, so you can\npotentially solve this problem in a way that nobody else has. If\nyou're building a solution, how large that solution space is gives\nthe player a much stronger feeling of empathy. If they know\nthat what they’ve done is unique to them, they tend to care for\nit a lot more. I think that’s the direction I tend to come from.”\n\nWright believes that simulations as games\ncan be used to improve education by teaching\nchildren how to learn. In his own words:\n\n“The problem with our education system is we’ve\ntaken this kind of narrow, reductionist, Aristotelian approach\nto what learning is. It’s not designed for experimenting\nwith complex systems and navigating your way through\nthem in an intuitive way, which is what games teach. It’s not\n\nreally designed for failure, which is also something games\nteach. I mean, I think that failure is a better teacher than\nsuccess. Trial and error, reverse-engineering stuff in your\nmind—all the ways that kids interact with games—that’s\nthe kind of thinking schools should be teaching. And I\nwould argue that as the world becomes more complex, and\nas outcomes become less about success or failure, games\nare better at preparing you. The education system is going\nto realize this sooner or later. It’s starting. Teachers are\nentering the system who grew up playing games. They’re\ngoing to want to engage with the kids using games.”\n\nWright will appear as a character in the video game\nMr. T, where he will team up with Mr. T to fight Nazis.\n\nWright was given a “Lifetime Achievement\nAward” at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2001.\n\nIn 2002, he became the fifth person to be inducted into the\nAcademy of Interactive Arts and Sciences’ Hall of Fame.\nUntil 2006, he was the only person to have been honored\nthis way by both of these industry organizations. In 2007\nthe British Academy of Film and Television Arts awarded\nhim a fellowship, the first given to a game designer.\n\nHe has been called one of the most important\npeople in gaming, technology, and entertainment by\npublications such as Entertainment Weekly, Time, PC Gamer,\nDiscover and GameSpy. Wright was also awarded the PC\nMagazine Lifetime Achievement Award in January 2005.\n\nIn 1980, along with co-driver and race organizer\nRick Doherty, Wright participated in the U.S. Express,\n\na cross-country race that was the predecessor to The\nCannonball Run. Wright and Doherty drove a specially\noutfitted Mazda RX-7 from Brooklyn, New York to Santa\nMonica, California in 33:39, winning the illegal race. Wright\nonly competed once in the race, which continued until 1983.\n\nSince 2003, in his spare time, Wright has collected\nleftovers from the Soviet space program, “including a\n100-pound hatch from a space shuttle, a seat from a\nSoyuz... control panels from the Mir”, and the control\n\nconsole of the Soyuz 23, as well as dolls, dice, and\nfossils. During E3 2004 he passed off an old lapel pin\ncommemorating the Soviet space program to a reporter.\n“T’m uncollecting. I buy collections on eBay, and I\ndisperse them out to people again. I have to be like an entropic\nforce to collectors, otherwise all of this stuff will get sorted.”\nHe once built competitive robots for BattleBots\nwith his daughter, but no longer does so. As of November\n2006, Wright still had remnant bits of machined metal left\nover from his BattleBots days strewn about the garage of his\nOakland home. Wright was a former Robot Wars champion\nin the Berkeley-based robotics workshop, the Stupid Fun\nClub. One of Wright’s bots, designed with the help of Wright’s\ndaughter Cassidy, “Kitty Puff Puff”, fought against its\nopponents by sticking a roll of gauze onto its armature and\ncircling around them, encapsulating them and denying them\nmovement. The technique, cocooning, was eventually banned.\nFollowing his work in BattleBots, he has taken\nsteps into the field of human-robot interactions.\n“We build these robots and we take them down to\nBerkeley and study the interactions that people have with\nthe robots,” says Wright. “We built this newer one that has a\nrapid-fire pingpong cannon. It will fire about 10 per second.\nSo we give people this plastic bat and we say, ‘It’s set up to\nplay baseball. Do you want to play baseball? It’s going to\nshoot a little ball and you try to hit it.’ And all of a sudden\nit’s like da-da-da-da, and it’s pelting them with balls.”\nAfter building his reputation as one of the most\nimportant game designers in the world, Wright in 2009\nleft Maxis, the Electronic Arts owned studio he founded.\nHis first post-E.A. venture was the Stupid Fun Club.\nIn October 2010, Current TV announced that\nWill Wright will produce a new show for the network. The\nprogram, entitled Bar Karma, began airing in February 2011.\nIn October 2011, Will Wright became\na member of the Board of Directors of Linden\nLab, the creators of Second Life.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017566\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

While the sources of our returns will generally be idiosyncratic, there is no question that the\ntremendous amount of capital that has flown into the low-net multi-manager, i.e. “platform”, category, has\ncreated an even greater risk of exposure to “Platform Beta” for some of our managers, even while avoiding\nbroader equity market beta.\n\nPlatform Beta is a term we have heard used to describe the overlap of long and short positions, across some\nof the largest market-neutral, multi-manager hedge fund managers. While these overlapping names may be\nviewed as “smart money” positioning in some sense, there is also meaningful risk associated with being in\ncrowded longs and shorts due to the viciousness of the cascading effects when these portfolios are being\nliquidated, or re-sized quickly, as we observed in Q1 2016. For a variety of reasons, we believe that\nPlatform Beta has a true positive expectancy over time and with much less risk than other traditional factor\nrisks, especially ones taken on by long-only or long-biased investors. While we consider it to be an obvious\ngoal to avoid material exposure to all known market risk factors, we also attempt to reduce our more\ndifficult to measure Platform Beta exposure when possible. Despite the positive return expectation of\nPlatform Beta, we do not think a large or concentrated exposure to this factor is beneficial. Perhaps even\nmore importantly, we do not believe that all alpha is created equally, and we are trying to provide the most\nuncorrelated alpha as possible to our investors.\n\nSo how do we minimize overexposure to Platform Beta? We can monitor data that imperfectly points to\ncrowded names or themes, but the most direct way we seek to avoid crowded names is through our overall\nportfolio construction and manager-selection process. This is demonstrated in our continued focus on “First\nLoss” allocations as well as investments in the strategy category we call “Other”, which is comprised of\nniche strategies outside our more traditional long/short fundamental and quantitative strategies. These\nalternative categories have served as a valuable source of alpha as well as diversification away from\nPlatform Beta. Additionally, even in our more traditional strategies, we focus on allocating to smaller\nmanagers who can have larger parts of their portfolios in smaller capitalization companies, which tend to be\nless trafficked by the larger funds, and therefore are also less subject to the effects of large industry\ndeleveraging. We cannot avoid all of the dangers of hedge fund deleveraging but our conscious attempts to\ntarget differentiated strategies, and to limit concentration, has allowed us to be less impacted by these flows\nthan several other multi-manager platforms.\n\nPortfolio Attribution and Risk\n\nWithin our Multi-Strategy platform, the “Other” category was the largest contributor for both Q4 and 2016\noverall, contributing gross returns of +0.82% in Q4 and +2.19% YTD. The remaining quarterly and full-year\ngross return attribution within the Multi-Strategy platform were: “Fundamental L/S” at -0.86% in Q4 and\n+1.16% YTD, and “Quantitative” at 0.29% in Q4 and -1.53% YTD. Our First Loss platform allocations\ncontributed gross-returns of +0.72% in Q4 and +6.60% YTD.”\n\nThe Fund averaged approximately 0.39% daily Value at Risk during Q4 vs. 0.41% in Q3 (95% Confidence\nInterval, excluding First-Loss allocations). As stated in last quarter’s letter, we expect to see an increase in\nour VaR during Q1 2017 primarily through a combination of new manager allocations and a pick-up in\noverall market volatility due to macro events on the horizon.

Many had held the title, but one of the\nmost frequent winners was White House counsel Don McGahn. He was\na constant target for his boss's belittling, mocking, falsetto-voice mimicry,\nand, as well, sweeping disparagements of his purpose and usefulness.\n\n“This is why we can’t have nice things,” McGahn uttered almost obses-\nsively under his breath, quoting the Taylor Swift song to comment on\nwhatever egregious act Trump had just committed (“ . . because you break\nthem,” the song continues).\n\nMcGahn's background was largely as a federal election lawyer. Mostly\nhe was on the more-money, less-transparency side—he was against, rather\nthan for, aggressive enforcement of election laws. He served as the counsel\nto the Trump campaign, arguably among the most careless about election\nlaw compliance in recent history. Before joining the Trump administra-\ntion, McGahn had no White House or executive branch experience. He\nhad never worked in the Justice Department or, in fact, anywhere in gov-\nernment. Formerly an attorney for a nonprofit affiliated with the Koch\nbrothers, he was known as a hyperpartisan: when Obama’s White House\ncounsel, Kathy Ruemmler, the previous occupant of McGahr’s office,\nreached out to congratulate him and to offer to be a resource on past prac-\ntices, McGahn did not respond to her email.\n\ni\n:\n'\n;\nI\n\nSIEGE 39\n\nOne of McGahn's jobs was to navigate what was possibly the most\ncomplicated relationship in modern government: he was the effective\npoint person between the White House and the Department of Justice.\nPart of his portfolio, then, was to endure the president's constant rage and\nbewilderment about why the DO] was personally hounding him, and his\nincomprehension that he could do nothing about it.\n\n“It’s my Justice Department,’ Trump would tell McGahn, often repeat-\ning this more than dubious declaration in his signature triad.\n\nNobody could quite be certain of the number of times McGahn had\nhad to threaten, with greater or lesser intention, to quit if Trump made\ngood on his threat to fire the attorney general, the deputy attorney gen-\neral, or the special counsel. Curiously, one defense against the charge that\nthe president had tried to fire Mueller in June 2017 in an effort to end the\nspecial counsel's investigation—as the New York Times claimed in a Jan-\nuary 2018 scoop—was the fact that Trump was almost constantly trying\nto fire Mueller or other DOJ figures, doing so often multiple times a day.\n\nMcGahn’s steadying hand had so far helped avert an ultimate crisis.\nBut he had missed or let slip by or simply ignored a number of intemper-\nate, unwise, and interfering actions by the president that might, McGahn\nfeared, comprise the basis of obstruction charges. Deeply involved with the\nconservative Federalist Society and its campaign for “textualist” judges.\nMcGahn had long dreamed himself of becoming a federal judge him-\nself, but given the no-man’-land he occupied between Trump and the\nJustice Department—not to mention Trump’s sometimes daily attacks or\nthe DOJ’s independence, which McGahn had to accept or condone—he\nknew his future as a jurist was dead.\n\n+ oF\n\nFifteen months into Trumps tenure, the tensions between the administra-\ntion and the Department of Justice had erupted into open conflict. Now it\nwas war—the White House against its own DO).\n\nHere was a modern, post-Watergate paradox: the independence o:\nthe Justice Department. The DOJ might be, from every organizationa\nand statutory view, an instrument of the White House, and, as much a:\nany other agency, its mission might appear to be driven by whoever hele\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021143\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But you would never\nproceed to deliver the second property before I paid for the first one, unless you\nwere a fool.” I also warned of longer-term dangers: “terrorism, radical Islamic\nfundamentalism, the proliferation of surface-to-surface missiles and weapons of\nmass destruction, and threats to the long-term stability of the more pragmatic\nArab regimes.” I singled out Iran, because it was determined to export its brand\nof fundamentalism Islam, sponsor terror and develop a nuclear weapon.\n\nI also accompanied CSIS colleagues on speaking engagements to other\nAmerican cities. I was about to board a flight to Seattle in April when I got a\nmessage saying Rabin wanted to talk to me. After we took off, I used the on-\nboard phone facility and, with a swipe of a credit card, was soon on the line to\nthe Prime Minister. Since the exchange was in Hebrew, I’m fairly sure anyone\noverhearing me had no idea what we were talking about. “I need you to come\nback as soon as possible,” Rabin said. I already knew, from Giora, that he was\nanxious to find a long-term replacement as Minister of Interior. The leading\nlight in the Sephardi religious party Shas, Arye Deri, had had to leave the post\nunder allegations of bribe-taking. After Rabin had taken on the portfolio himself\nfour 18 months, he had placed Labor’s Uzi Baram there, but only as a\ntemporary arrangement. I didn’t feel I could refuse outright. But I reminded him\nthat under army rules, “as soon as possible” still meant another 100 days. And\nideally, I said I wanted to finish the best part of a year in Washington. I asked\nwhether it would be possible to join the cabinet in the middle of November\ninstead. “What difference will a few more months make?”\n\nRabin said he needed me now, and that mid-November would be too late.\n“Ehud, in politics, you can never predict what will happen by then.” Neither of\nus could have known how terribly prophetic his words would turn out to be.\n\nI was not only new to cabinet politics. I wasn’t even a member of the\nKnesset.

No one was being prevented from\nexpressing his or her views. The Quincy House Film Society was going to show Deep Throat; the\nHarvard administration was expressing but not imposing its views; the feminists were preparing\npamphlets, slide shows, and speakers to present theirs; and everyone was free to see and listen to\nall or none of these expressions.\n\nThe feminists seemed to be making their point quite effectively: more students were expected on\nthe picket lines and at the slide show than at the movie itself. Many in the Harvard community,\nwhile supporting the right of the Quincy House Film Society to show Deep Throat, now believed\nthat the society had been insensitive to the feelings of their feminist housemates by exhibiting an\noffensive film in the dormitory that was home to them all. I shared that view.\n\nThen everything changed. Days before the scheduled showing, two women residents of Quincy\nHouse, not satisfied to protest and picket, called the local District Attorney’s office and asked the\npolice to prevent the showing of Deep Throat and to arrest the students who were planning to\nshow it.\n\nThe local District Attorney was an elderly political hack named John Droney, who had repeatedly\nwon reelection on an uncompromising law-and-order platform. When he learned that the twin\nevils of obscenity and Harvard might merge on that fateful night, he dispatched an assistant to\ncourt in an effort to secure an injunction against the scheduled showing.\n\nIf there is anything more obnoxious to a civil libertarian than the punishment of speech after it has\ntaken place, it is the issuance of a prior injunction to prevent speech in the first place. Prior\nrestraint—as an injunction against speech has come to be known—s the purest form of\ncensorship. It seeks to prevent the speech from ever reaching the public. Now, almost ten years\nafter the Supreme Court had rebuffed efforts to enjoin publication of the Pentagon Papers, the\nDistrict Attorney of Middlesex County was seeking to enjoin the showing of a dirty movie to a\nsmall group of students in a college dormitory at Harvard.\n\nOnly hours before the scheduled performance, Carl Stork and Nathan J. Hagen—the co-\npresidents of the Quincy House Film Society—received telephone calls from the D.A.’s office\ndirecting them to be in Judge Charles R. Alberti’s courtroom at two o’clock for a hearing. Stork\nand Hagen tried to call me in my office. But I was at lunch, and my secretary couldn’t locate me.\nStork and Hagen told her the story and requested that I come to the court to assist them as soon\nas possible. I returned from lunch at two-fifteen, to learn that I was expected in court—fifteen\nminutes earlier!\n\nI quickly borrowed a colleague’s ill-fitting jacket, dug an old brown tie out of my desk drawer,\nand drove to the courthouse in downtown Cambridge.\n\nWithin minutes, I found myself before Judge Alberti, arguing against the injunction. With no\nbooks, cases, or statutes in my possession, I had to wing it. The judge was most understanding,\n\nasking the Assistant District Attorney to let me look over his shoulder at the relevant statute and\ncases.\n\n113\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017200\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

She co-founded and serves on the steering\ncommittee for the Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) Lab and is a co-principal investigator in\nBerkeley’s Center for Human-Compatible Al.\n\nAt the core of artificial intelligence is our mathematical definition of what an AI agent (a\nrobot) is. When we define a robot, we define states, actions, and rewards. Think of a\ndelivery robot, for instance. States are locations in the world, and actions are motions\nthat the robot makes to get from one position to a nearby one. To enable the robot to\ndecide on which actions to take, we define a reward function—a mapping from states and\nactions to scores indicating how good that action was in that state—and have the robot\nchoose actions that accumulate the most “reward.” The robot gets a high reward when it\nreaches its destination, and it incurs a small cost every time it moves; this reward function\nincentivizes the robot to get to the destination as quickly as possible. Similarly, an\nautonomous car might get a reward for making progress on its route and incur a cost for\ngetting too close to other cars.\n\nGiven these definitions, a robot’s job is to figure out what actions it should take in\norder to get the highest cumulative reward. We’ve been working hard in AI on enabling\nrobots to do just that. Implicitly, we’ve assumed that if we’re successful—if robots can\ntake any problem definition and turn into a policy for how to act—we will get robots that\nare useful to people and to society.\n\nWe haven’t been too wrong so far. If you want an AI that classifies cells as either\ncancerous or benign, or a robot that vacuums the living room rug while you’re at work,\nwe've got you covered. Some real-world problems can indeed be defined in isolation,\nwith clear-cut states, actions, and rewards. But with increasing AI capability, the\nproblems we want to tackle don’t fit neatly into this framework. We can no longer cut\noff a tiny piece of the world, put it in a box, and give it to a robot. Helping people is\nstarting to mean working in the real world, where you have to actually interact with\npeople and reason about them. “People” will have to formally enter the AI problem\ndefinition somewhere.\n\nAutonomous cars are already being developed. They will need to share the road\nwith human-driven vehicles and pedestrians and learn to make the trade-off between\ngetting us home as fast as possible and being considerate of other drivers. Personal\nassistants will need to figure out when and how much help we really want and what types\nof tasks we prefer to do on our own versus what we can relinquish control over. A DSS\n(Decision Support System) or a medical diagnostic system will need to explain its\nrecommendations to us so we can understand and verify them. Automated tutors will\nneed to determine what examples are informative or illustrative—not to their fellow\nmachines but to us humans.\n\nLooking further into the future, if we want highly capable Als to be compatible\nwith people, we can’t create them in isolation from people and then try to make them\ncompatible afterward; rather, we’ll have to define “human-compatible” AI from the get-\ngo. People can’t be an afterthought.\n\n98\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016318\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We can expect\npotential forthcoming advances around the control of information feeds with applications in\nspreading propaganda, via spreading false or misleading information, creating anxiety, fueling\nconspiracy theories, and influencing voting. Such methods will bring key challenges to democracy.\n\nCHALLENGES AHEAD WITH Al, PROPOGANDA, AND PERSUASION\n\nData-centric analyses have been long used in marketing, advertising, and campaigning over\ndecades. However, over the past few years, we have seen the rise of the use of more powerful\ntools, including machine learning and inference aimed at algorithmic manipulation, with the target\nof influencing the thinking and actions of people. Some initial uses of these methods reportedly\nplayed a role in influencing the outcome of recent US presidential elections, as well as the\nelections in 2008 and 2012. We can expect to see an upswing in methods that manipulate states of\ninformation in a personalized automated manner. These systems can be designed and deployed as\nomnipresent/persistent, and aimed at specific goals for group- or person-centric persuasion.\n\nAs our data and models of how people consume and act on information improve, and as an\nincreasing portion of information consumption is mediated through digital systems managed by\npotentially opaque algorithms, it becomes increasingly conceivable that the information ecosystem\nwould get captured by malicious actors deploying increasingly advanced tools to control, shape,\nforge and personalize information, from ads to news reports.\n\nMachine learning, in conjunction with active learning, expected value decision making, and\noptimization of allocations of key resources, such as dollars or human effort, can be targeted at\nmonitoring, understanding, and then working to influence the beliefs and actions of large\npopulations of people. Data can be collected from large-scale populations, across multiple devices\nand services, and used to make inferences about the psychologies and beliefs of people, and for\ndesigning and guiding persuasive flows of sequences of information. Uses of Al can include\nattempts to optimize stealthiness of the interventions.\n\nIn the future, a great deal of the information consumed by citizens on personal devices is subject\nto alteration by information-engineers at media corporations and governmental propaganda\noffices, such that outside a few key positions of power no one really knows what is going on in the\nworld. There is a danger of the growth of domination over time of large populations by a single\ndominant or a few systems.

The Obama\nadministration found that conflicted advice cost\nsavers about $17 billion a year based on a 2015\nreport. To be clear, the Rule applies only to retire-\nment accounts like 401(k)s and individual retire-\nment accounts (“IRAs”), not to regular taxable\naccounts. According to the Investment Company\nInstitute, Americans invest $7.8 trillion in IRAs\nand $7 trillion in 401(k)s.\n\nOn January 20, 2017, the DOL issued two new\nsets of Frequently Asked Questions (“FAQs”) on\nthe Rule. One of the sets of FAQs focuses on the\nnew definition of fiduciary investment advice\nand the other set is geared toward retirement\ninvestors and consumers, covering consumer\nprotection features of the new Rule. This is the\nsecond of three rounds of guidance to be pub-\nlished by the DOL prior to the effective date of\nthe new Rule.\n\nThe Executive Branch also issued responses to\nthe Rule on January 20, 2017. The White House\nissued a Memorandum from Reince Priebus to the\nheads of the executive departments and agencies\nrequesting a sixty (60)-day delay as the effective\ndate of regulations published in the Office of the\nFederal Register have not taken effect as of yet.\n\nOn February 3, 2017, President Trump signed a\npresidential memorandum to delay the Rule by\nsix (6)-months, casting doubt on its viability.\nThe memorandum instructs the DOL to conduct\n\na new “economic and legal analysis’ to deter-\nmine whether the Rule is likely to harm inves-\ntors, disrupt the industry or cause an increase\nin litigation and the price of advice. If the DOL\nconcludes that the regulation does hurt inves-\ntors or firms, it can propose a rule “rescind-\ning or revising” the regulation. On March 1,\n2017, the DOL issued a proposed rule, which\nwill extend the applicability date of its fidu-\nciary rule, including the Best Interest Contract\nExemption, from April 10, 2017 to June 9, 2017,\na 60-day delay.\n\nSome are saying the Rule would hurt investors\nbecause it would supposedly make it harder\nfor people to receive retirement advice. For\nexample, advisers would not be able to afford\nto service low-balance retirement accounts.\nOn the other hand, consumer, labor and civil\nrights groups have pushed for the Rule saying\nthat the current system provides a loophole\nthat lets brokers drain money from retirement\naccounts in fees they receive that can sway\nthe investment advice they give their retire-\nment accounts. We see that many retirement\nadvisers already have chosen to act in their\nclients’ best interests, opting to work under\nthe fiduciary standard—it is ultimately a\nbusiness advantage.\n\nThe FAQs are available on the DOL’s website\nand the Memoranda are available on the White\nHouse Press Office website.\n\nFAQs\nhttps://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/\nabout-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/\nfaqs/coi-rules-and-exemptions-part-2. pdf\n\nhttps://www.dol. gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/\nabout-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/\nconsumer-protections-for-retirement-investors-\nyour-rights-and-financial-advisers.pdf\n\nMemoranda\n\nJanuary 20, 2017—Regulatory Freeze Pending\nReview\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-\noffice/2017/01/20/memorandum-heads-execu-\ntive-departments-and-agencies\n\nFebruary 3, 2017—Fiduciary Duty Rule\n\nhttps ://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/\n2017/02/03/ presidential-memorandum-fiduciary-\nduty-rule\n\nDaniel G.

Obviously. Were we normal? Unfortunately, yes. A few months ago, I\nchatted with another American HIV educator about the situation here in Africa. \"They\nknow to use condoms,\" she complained, \"and they have the condoms! I just don't get it!\"\n\n\"I agree that it's incomprehensible,\" I said, \"but hey, I haven't always been 100% careful,\nand I'm a sex educator.\"\n\nShe glanced at me, then away. \"Yeah, I haven't either,” she admitted. There was a gloomy\npause, and then we couldn't help it -- we cracked up. \"I hate love,\" she said when the\ngiggles subsided. She shook her head. \"That shit fucks with you.\"\n\nWhy didn't I use condoms with that ex? I still don't know! When you instruct people to\nuse condoms as often as I do, you get accustomed to the arguments. I hear the same\nreasons we didn't use condoms -- because they don't feel as good, because they interrupt\nthe moment, etc. etc. etc. -- I hear them, I smile and I tell the audience, \"You gotta use\n‘em anyway, folks.\" I'm a hypocrite, but what else can I say?\n\nAnd there are deeper-rooted objections to condoms -- objections that are both rarely\nstated in public, and harder to confront. One is trust, which I've been struggling with for a\nlong time, since before I got to Africa. I don't think it's good for condom discussions to\ncenter on trust, and I wish I had more ideas about how to refocus them. \"Use condoms\nbecause you can't trust anyone, not even your lover,\" is an ugly message to impart.\nMoreover, it only encourages the audience to view not using condoms as a gift, or a\nsignifier of trust.\n\nIn America, I tend to cast it like this: \"Safer sex is normal. It's the baseline. Lots of people\npractice it. It's an assumption. Act like it.\" Which, I hope, helps people simply default to\nsafer sex without forcing direct questions about any given partner's integrity. Hopefully,\nit also distracts attention from seeing discarding condoms as a gift. But the truth is that\ncondom usage isn't always an assumption even in America (witness myself and my ex).\nAnd it's less of an assumption here in Africa. How can I avoid validating the viewpoint\nthat not using condoms is the best way to express trust?\n\nThe second deep-rooted objection -- again, both in Africa and America -- is inability to\nmaintain an erection while using a condom. When I was younger, I used to think that\nguys were just whining when they claimed they couldn't keep it up with a condom, but in\nmy old age I've determined that People Are Different (no way!): while most men deal\nwith condoms just fine, some men genuinely can't. Since people tend to be bad at\ncommunicating about sex and especially bad at making space for conversations about\nnon-normative male sexuality, this isn't often acknowledged. Fortunately, the solution is\neasy: men who have trouble with condomised penis-in-vagina sex gain a glorious\nopportunity to explore all the other kinds of sex!\n\nPeople tend to panic when confronted with the idea of a man who can't have penetrative\nsex. But that's sex-negative nonsense based entirely on the stereotype of \"real sex\" as\npenis-in-vagina intercourse. The solution to loss of erection isn't to sit around awkwardly\nwishing you could be having penetrative sex. The solution is for both partners to start\nexploring with mouths, hands... and words. But teaching about this means speaking very\nexplicitly, and it can be hard to have those conversations in a conservative society\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018591\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The quantity of\ninformation we are looking at here is greater than the storage capacity of\nthe Universe and would collapse space-time to a black hole before I got\neven a fraction of the way through. Let us try to be a bit cleverer about\nthe task of creating this information.\n\nThe simplest way to tie the computer down is to run a much\nstricter program.

The average global growth pace of the past 3 months has fallen to only 1.8%, barely more than half of trend. The expectation\nremains that Q1 should come in at 2.4% as both Japan and the Euro area exit recession.\n\n° While staying overall long risk markets, both credit and equities at the moment, we have increasingly focused on tactical\ncross-market exposures, and in particular the underweight of US equities. In GMOS this week, we took profit on the overweight of\nEuro area equities against the US given the still very weak economy, with Q4 likely now the biggest GDP decline since the end of the\nglobal recession (We do stay overweight Euro periphery bond). But we remain aggressively overweight both Japan and EM Asia\nversus the US, with Japan currency hedged. The upside surprise on Chinese CPI today dented its equity market somewhat, but we\nthink this will be temporary as it should not yet lead to monetary tightening. The recent set of strong trade and industrial data from\nChina and the region are signaling to us significant upside risk on Q1 and 2013 growth projections.\n\ne We have been long Japanese equities since Nov 16, which more by luck than skill defined the beginning of its equity rally.\nTopix is up 20% since then, almost straight line. We believe new PM Abe conviction and political power to reflate the economy are\nreal. It has already helped the yen lose 10% versus the dollar. Given this move, faster fiscal easing and support from equities, we have\nraised our 2013 growth forecast for a 3rd time, this time to 0.8%. We stay long the Japanese reflation trade.\n\nFixed Income\n\n° Bonds recovered some of their losses from last week, but remain down on the year. We do not see the current surge in\nequities as a negative for bonds, yet, as equity inflows are not coming out of bond funds, and growth remains too weak to elicit an\nearly end to QE. With USTs very much at the top of their 6-month trading range, we go tactically long duration, but would take profit\nsoon on a decent rally. In the Euro are, in contrast, the continued flow into the periphery should remain negative for Bund and euro\nswaps. We retain a bearish bias here.\n\nEquities\n\n° Equities are up again this week, helped by rapidly improving equity ETF inflows. Strong buying by retail investors is\nadding fuel to equity markets against a backdrop of rather subdued macro drivers, maintaining a positive-near term momentum. The\nreporting season is also helping with US companies beating so far by 2% the bottom up analysts’ estimates at the beginning of the\nyear.\n\n° Our recommended equity portfolio focuses on regional and sectoral exposures. Underweighting US equities remains our\nmain regional theme. This trade also protects our portfolio against looming debt ceiling risks. US equities had been the consensus\noverweight by equity investors for two years and their outperformance started reversing over the summer. US equities have so far\nerased their 2012 outperformance but are far from erasing their 2011 outperformance.\n\ne We focus the US equity underweight against EM Asia and Japan. In GMOS this week, we took profit on our overweight\nin MSCI EMU versus S&P500 given looming Italian election risks into February, and still disappointing European economic activity\ndata. We stay overweight in Topix vs. S&P500 currency hedged. Fiscal easing, financed via debt monetization, and coupled with\nstructural reforms has the potential to sustain this trade beyond a 3-6 month horizon, in our view. This week’s fiscal stimulus\nannounced by the Japanese gov’t appears supportive of the Japanese trade.\n\n° Across sectors we favor Cyclical vs. Defensive sectors but have taken part profit as the pace of the improvement in the global\nmanufacturing PMI slowed in December. We stay overweight the DJ US Home Construction Index and large mortgage banks (BKX\nIndex) vs. the S&P500 to position for a continued recovery in US housing.\n\nCredit\n\n° High-grade spreads and yields were a few bps tighter this week, although US and European high-yield continued to rally\nstrongly. Double-digit spread tightening sent both to new all-time yield lows; now just 5.9% in the US and 6.5% in Europe. The clear\noutlier this week was EMBIG, the ill health of the Venezuelan president and a NY court ruling in favor of hold-out creditors in\nArgentina’s ‘pari passu’ saga helped push spreads up 12bp. We believe such idiosyncrasies driving relative performance signals an\nuncharacteristic break-down in spread correlations and a welcome move-away from the one-factor-drives-all world of late.\n\n° The strength of equity flows has caught our attention this week, but there is little evidence of a wider rotation out of bonds.\nThere has indeed been some evidence of bond into equity fund flows in ETFs (best seen through our flow radars in Flows &\nLiquidity), but bond mutual funds continue to see inflows, which accelerated this week. Also, our client survey reports on-going\ndemand for credit and new issues remain well bid (see CMOS and F&L for more details).\n\nForeign Exchange\n\n° 2013 has started with bubbling optimism across global markets. Equities are approaching five-year highs and credit\nspreads their five-year lows, while government bonds are selling off worldwide and inflation breakevens behave (outside the UK).\nAnd per the traditional pattern, the dollar is falling versus most currencies, except those which entered 2013 with enormous liabilities\n— the yen given Japan’s full-throated commitment to looser monetary and fiscal policy, and the rand on sovereign credit and balance of\npayment concerns. EUR/USD has spiked since Thursday’s ECB meeting but is underperforming much of the commodity complex\n(MXN, CLP, AUD, NZD) year-to-date, highlighting that China's data surprises this week count for as much as a less-worried ECB.\n\n° These country-specific issues are more powerful than systemic ones for the moment, which is likely why correlations\nacross dollar-based pairs have sunk to three-year lows. The yen story still looks to us the most unique — USD/JPY is the only major\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031122\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I have taken friends by the Epstein mansion, and the\nreaction to its other-worldly size in Manhattan is almost always the same: an\nincredulous guffaw. Press accounts, seldom supplying new information, ever\nrecycle and repeat the mysterious (and monstrous) billionaire mythology,\nwith brief glimpses of him stepping out of the house (the same photos\nendlessly republished), and the assumption of depravity inside.\n\nIn fact, the life in the house, without wife or children or conventional\ndomestic demeanor, in some way conforms to the most scripted fantasies: a\nlife somewhere between Daddy Warbucks and Eyes Wide Shut.\n\nThe domesticity of the house, and the background of Epstein’s\nproblems, centers around a group of young women who act as his support\nstaff and companions. Some have worked for him for many years, marrying,\nhaving children, and continuing as part of his business and household\ninfrastructure. One woman, on an afternoon when I was there, recently\nmarried, had just returned from an around the world honeymoon that Epstein\nhad arranged for her. Some are his romantic interests. His present girl friend\nis in dental school. One former girlfriend, Eva Andersson Dubin, a Swedish\nmodel and Miss Universe finalist, became a doctor and married hedge\nfunder Glen Dubin and together they finance the Dubin Breast Center at\nMount Sinai Hospital. Most at one time will travel with him to his floating\nresidences—the ranch in New Mexico, the vast apartment in Paris, the Island\nin the Caribbean, the house in Palm Beach.\n\nThis is so outside of conventional living or staffing or romantic\nrelationships that it is hard to describe in a straightforward way. It\nsometimes seems part of Epstein’s implicit challenge: not just look at me,\nbut do you dare look at me? Or it seems he is just oblivious to what other’s\nare thinking. A sort of fatal tone deafness.\n\nEpstein’s young women mingle freely with his powerful guests, not so\nmuch as hostess or, in tabloid language, harem-like (or as “sex slaves’’), but\noften as attentive students (that, of course, might be regarded as having its\nown fetish-like attraction).\n\nOnce, Epstein invited me to sit in on a day of presentations to him in\nhis dining room by various “quants.” Quant theory involves making\ninvestments based solely on mathematical and statistical models. This\nmethod can often have uncanny predictive powers. But the problem is it\ndoesn’t scale very well—the market, having discerned a pattern of\nsuccessful investing, quickly copies and discounts the advantage.

While they differed from each\nother, they shared the goal of creating preferential treatment for certain pass-through business income. The Act\nlargely took the Senate’s approach but adopted a few elements of the House’s approach. The Act approaches\nsmall business relief by permitting a non-itemized deduction of 20% of qualified business income; the remaining\n80% would then be subject to normal tax rates. Therefore, the top tax rate for business income would be 29.6%\n(80% x 37% = 29.6%). The provision is riddled with a host of complex limitations. For taxpayers not in the top\nincome tax bracket, the value of the deduction will depend on the marginal bracket that would otherwise be\nimposed on the income.\n\nOwners of service businesses (e.g., law, accounting and consulting, etc., but not engineering or architectural\nservices) generally would be eligible for the 20% deduction unless taxable income exceeds $315,000 for married\nfiling jointly ($157,500 for others).

See Preceding Undisputed Facts. Because of the\noutrageousness of Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor girls, Edwards reasonably expected that\nEpstein would also be liable for punitive damages to the girls. Because Edwards could show that\nEpstein had molested children for years and designed a complex premeditated scheme to procure\ndifferent minors everyday to satisfy his addiction to sex with minors, the punitive damages\nwould have to be sufficient to deter him from this illegal conduct that he had engaged in daily for\nyears. Epstein was and is a billionaire. See Complaint, §49 (referring to “Palm Beach\nBillionaire”); see also Epstein Deposition, February 17, 2010, at 172-176 (Deposition\nAttachment #7) (taking the Fifth when asked whether he is a billionaire). Accordingly, Edwards\nreasonably believed the punitive damages that would have to be awarded against Epstein would\nhave been substantial enough to punish him severely enough for his past conduct as well as deter\nhim from repeating his offenses in the future. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit “N” at (19.\n\n85. On July 6, 2010, rather than face trial for the civil suits that had been filed against\nhim by L.M., E.W., and Jane Doe, defendant Epstein settled the cases against him. The terms of\nthe settlement are confidential.

Analysis was\nperformed by the City’s analysts at the Water Treatment Plant’s laboratory. Results from\nHSA’s sampling of the Town’s drinking water from northern-most Tap A (IDSE #6) are directly\ncompared to the City’s routine sampling of drinking water from distribution system tap LINL\n(closest to Tap A). Results from HSA’s sampling of the Town’s drinking water from southern-\nmost Tap B (3230) are compared directly to those from the City’s sampling of that tap. TTHM\nconcentrations from HSA’s November 2008 sampling event are slightly higher than the\naverages of the results reported from the City’s latest quarterly sampling from tap LINL and tap\n3230, respectively. The difference between these results is not relevant since the reported\nconcentrations from the City and from HSA’s sampling event are still less than the MCL. It is\nnoted that the concentration of TTHMs reported from the City’s annual compliance event\n(collected at the Treatment Plant) is close to the MCL. This is not unexpected as the sampling\nlocation (treatment plant laboratory tap) is much closer to the point of disinfection than the\ndistribution system sampling taps.

This results in brief incidences of potable water product with a\nnotable change in the taste and higher concentrations of DBPRs. Concentrations of DBPRs\nand the stronger taste of chlorine subside with the inevitable reduction of chlorination.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAs a measure of the quality of the drinking water product being delivered to the Town by the\nCity, results from HSA’s November 2008 collection of potable water from the northern-most\nand southern-most distribution system sampling taps revealed target regulated drinking water\nparameters at concentrations below the MCL standards established in FDEP rule 62-770,\nF.A.C.\n\nA comparative of the results obtained from HSA’s sampling event to the City’s reported annual\nand quarterly results from 2008 monitoring events found minor variations in reported\nconcentrations for select parameters (see Table 1). These variations pose no concern for the\nquality of the potable water product being delivered to the Town since all parameter\nconcentrations reported from the City’s monitoring events and by HSA’s sampling event are\nless than respective MCLs.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016687\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

They monitored the comings and goings of its owner’s\nprivate jet, subpoenaed his phone records and riffled through his trash.\n\nThe owner was Jeffrey Epstein, 53, an intensely private New York money manager with\nseveral billionaire clients. Months earlier, the stepmother of a 14-year-old girl told the\nPalm Beach police that a wealthy older man, whom the girl later identified as Mr.\nEpstein, might have had inappropriate sexual contact with her.\n\nIn sworn statements to the police, the 14-year-old and other teenage girls said a friend\nhad arranged for them to visit Mr. Epstein’s home and give him massages, usually in\ntheir underwear, in exchange for cash.\n\nMost of the girls, according to the police, said Mr. Epstein had masturbated during the\nmassages, and a few said he had penetrated them with his fingers or penis. They\nidentified him in photos and accurately described the inside of his home. Some recalled\nthat his employees had fed them snacks or rented them cars.\n\nMr. Epstein pleaded not guilty in August to the crime he was ultimately charged with,\nsoliciting prostitution. But at a time when prosecutors around the nation have become\nincreasingly severe in dealing with people accused of sex offenses, the case has raised\nquestions about whether Mr. Epstein’s prominence won him preferential treatment.\n\nBy the account of the police, they found probable cause to charge Mr. Epstein with much\nmore serious offenses: one count of lewd and lascivious molestation and four counts of\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor.\n\nBut instead of proceeding with such charges on his own, the Palm Beach County state\nattorney took the rare step of presenting a broad range of possible charges to a grand jury,\nwhich indicted Mr. Epstein in July on the lesser count. In Florida, prosecutors usually\nrefer only capital cases to grand juries.\n\nEven before the indictment, the Palm Beach police chief, Michael Reiter, had accused\nprosecutors of giving Mr. Epstein special treatment and asked the state attorney, Barry E.\nKrischer, to remove himself from the case.\n\nIn an editorial, The Palm Beach Post attacked Mr. Krischer, a Democrat whose post is\nelective, saying the public had been left “to wonder whether the system tilted in favor of\na wealthy, well-connected alleged perpetrator and against very young girls who are\nalleged victims of sex crimes.”\n\nThe case has taken a toll on the reputation of Mr. Epstein, who owns a palatial home in\nManhattan, has pledged $30 million to Harvard and once flew former President Bill\nClinton on his 727. Politicians including Eliot Spitzer, a Democratic candidate for\ngovernor in New York, and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, also a Democrat, have\nreturned campaign contributions from him.\n\nBut Mr. Epstein fought back, assembling a team of star lawyers, including Gerald B.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021802\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Naturally, local women don't get multiple spouses, and the social\npenalties for infidelity are much worse for women. In America, feminists often point out\nthat \"slut\" is an insult while \"stud\" is a compliment; there's a similar linguistic trend in\nsiZulu, but the English words are mild compared to their siZulu equivalents.\n\nte Kk ok\n\nI rarely practice consensual non-monogamy myself, but I don't hesitate to advocate\ndestigmatizing polyamory and swing in America. True, my primary interest is BDSM,\nbut there's so much to learn from every form of consensual sexuality. Plus, we're\nbasically on the same side -- it'd be great if different sex subcultures had more\nconsciousness of a sex-positive \"agenda\" or \"movement\"! Although our communities\nhave different emphases and, sometimes, profoundly different values, I see swingers and\npolyfolk as my brothers- and sisters-in-arms.\n\nBut enough of the soapbox! The point is that I've often defended poly -- and I've gotten\ninto interesting arguments doing so. One friend noted just how hard it is for poly people\nto negotiate their relationships. \"It's so complicated,” he complained. \"So much\ncommunication is required. Doesn't that seem like an argument against it? If polyamory\nwere really a good relationship model, then people wouldn't have to put so much effort\ninto accomplishing it.”\n\n\"It's only complicated because polyamory isn't our societal default,\" I replied. \"People\nhave to put extra effort into negotiating relationships that fall outside the norm. The same\nthing happens with BDSM. Kinksters must spend a lot more time discussing our sexual\nrelationships, because it's more dangerous for us to make assumptions about where our\npartners want to go. That doesn't mean there's anything wrong with kink.\n\n\"And,\" I added, \"that extra effort can be a feature, not a bug! The fact that kinksters spend\nso much time isolating different aspects of our sexuality has given us a uniquely fine-\ngrained sexual vocabulary. I think most kinksters tend to make fewer assumptions about\nour partners' boundaries than vanilla people do. And circumstances have forced us to\ndevelop some brilliant strategies for bedroom communication. I'm not saying we're all\nbrilliant communicators, but I think we've got a unique window on it. When I run sexual\ncommunication workshops, half the tactics I share are filched from the BDSM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018585\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

A substantial part of the policy of reconciliation between Obama and Raul Castro\ndepends on the lifting of the embargo. Although there is great pressure from the White\nHouse, and surveys showing that the majority of Americans want the sanctions to end,\nthere are no guarantees that this will be achieved during this presidency. Neither can\none predict what will happen with the relations between the two countries if the next\nelections are won by a Republican candidate. Two of the most prominent ones, Jeb\nBush and Marco Rubio, have criticized President Obama for his new Cuban policy.\n\n2. The repeal of the 1996 Helms-Burton is one of the key requirements for Cuba to be able\nto approach the IDB, the IMF, or the World Bank. Without that credit, which requires\nCuba’s affiliation with these organizations, the Island will have no access to loans to\nrebuild the costly infrastructure that the country needs. It’s a very slow process that will\ntake a great deal of time.\n\n3. Cuba depends in large measures on subsidies from Venezuela, and Chavism is going\nthrough a very bad time, which could end up in its destruction and substitution with a\ngovernment unfavorable to “the Cubans.” The disappearance of Chavism in Venezuela\nwould be an economic and political catastrophe for Cuba. Today the popularity of\nNicolas Maduro is less than 20%.\n\n4. The political stability of the Cuban regime until now has depended on control by Fidel\nand Raul Castro. Fidel just turned 89, and Raul will be 84 in June. With them the\ngeneration of the revolution will come to an end, giving way to younger people, led by\nRaul Castro’s chosen heir, Engineer Miguel Diaz-Canel, who is 55. What’s going to\nhappen then? Could the regime transmit the authority within the Community single-\nparty model without the old leaders who until now have lent shape and sense to the\ngovernment. Will there arise other candidates with uncontrollable ambitions,\npresumably young military men, with the intention of taking command? Nobody knows.\nNevertheless, Cuban history has been bloody when regimes reach their end. They are\nreplaced by violence.\n\n5: It will be very risky to invest in properties confiscated from their legitimate owners\nduring the first years of the revolution. In both the United States and Spain there are\norganizations of those injured who are willing to go to court in defense of their rights,\nand who have hired lawyers to do just that. Originally the victims of the confiscations\nwere North Americans or Spaniards, but over time Cuban-Americans and Hispano-\nCubans have been added. Both the United States Congress and Senate and the Spanish\nParliament have legislators with these origins.\n\n6. What will probably happen will be something similar to the case of Nicaragua.\nNicaraguan exiles, infinitely fewer in number and power than the Cuban-Americans,\nwithout congressmen in Washington with their origins, managed to condition American\naid to the solution of the confiscations they had suffered during the first decade of the\nSandinista government. What’s predictable is that the injured Americans, together with\nthe Cuban-Americans, will manage to halt any American aid or benefit destined for Cuba\nuntil their property is returned to them or they are compensated for them.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025098\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Everyone I spoke to pointed their fingers in the same\ndirection and the worst place possible, Ritchie’s house. One of his best\nfriends told me of how bad he was doing, “He’s not the same guy\nanymore, and all he cares about is the next high he gets. If we don’t get\nanything for him he just loses it and goes off somewhere.” It was hard to\nhear how badly affected my best friend was and a part of me secretly\nhoped they weren’t right. Still defending him, I told everyone I had spoke\ntoo while trying to find him that T.J would be fine, he’s just probably\ngoing through a bad phase, like we all do sometimes and needs people to\nhave his back more than ever now. I was pretty much laughed at on the\nspot, most people that I considered my friends at the time were only\nfriends by association. As long as we all looked the part, acted the part,\nand could handle the part, only then did they want to be around us. The\nlast person I called was the last person I had hoped he wasn’t with and it\nturned out that everyone was right.\n\nHe was with one of the biggest Coke dealers in our area, Ritchie-Rich,\nas everyone used to call him. He didn’t look like a typical strung out\njunkie or dealer. Instead he looked like your average preppy college grad\nwith aspiring propositions. He dressed well and acted like a nice guy to\nimminent clients only to get them hooked on his drugs and then tums\nthem out onto the streets. He was a businessman and his business was\nthriving. He carried everything from most drugs to guns and knives.\nHaving ears in all places made him a dangerous acquaintance.

Obtaining Ritchie’s number from one of T.J’s friends\nMarcus he asked me, “What do you want to call Ritchie for? Come over\nto my place and I can get you whatever you want” Marcus was a sleaze\nbag who would tirelessly continue to try to appeal to my lesser sense of\njudgment, never getting the hint or just not caring that I could never and\nwould never be interested in him. “No Thanks Marcus, can I just get the\nnumber please, it’s very important that I get ahold of TJ, ['m really\nworried about him.” I hated having to call this guy let alone have to ask\nhim for something. “Is this about the Adam bullshit? Cause if it is you\ncan let him know what a fucking bitch he is for not showing up to be\nthere for him, you can tell him from me that it’s his fault and it should’ve\nbeen him that’s lying in the morgue now, not Adam” I was totally thrown\n\n99\n\nL Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004232\n\nby his allegations I could only mutter out a whisper “Did you just say that\nAdam is dead, what happened?” “Oh snaps, | thought you knew, where\nhave you been girl, under a rock or something?” Marcus was less than\nsensitive about his statements. “He got shot in the head by two black guys\nwho got suspicious when their usual supplier didn’t show up, your boy\nT.J was so fucked up he didn’t even remember to turn up at Ritchie’s for\nthe delivery, so Ritchie sent Adam alone and now he’s dead.” Adam was\na sweet kid who just happened to be born living on the wrong block. Best\nfriends with T.J since childhood, the two were inseparable until puberty\nhit and even then they would chase girls together. Adam followed in TJ's\nevery footstep, mimicking his shadow, if T.J jumped off the Eifel Tower\nthen so would Adam so when T.J got hooked on drugs consequently\nAdam did too, leading ultimately to his death. Wanting to end the\nconversation with Marcus quickly I scribbled down the phone number on\na blank piece of paper in front of me and hung up the phone to call\nRitchie’s place immediately.\n\n“Yeah?” It was Ritchie whom bluntly answered the phone after the first\nring. “Hi -Uh- Rich, It’s Jenna, T.J’s ex, we met a couple of times at a\nfew parties” I was trying to remind him of who | was knowing how\nparanoid he was about people having his number. “Oh yeah, I know who\nyou are, what is it you want?” He answered with a dry tone. “ | was\nhoping you could tell me where I could find T.J, Pve heard some stuff\nand am really worried about him, is he alright?” Ritchie snickered at my\nconcerns. “What are you his Mom or something? He’s fine, he should be\nback here around five o’clock, I'l! tell him you called.” In the middle of\nme saying “Thanks and good-bye” he hung up the phone, as there is no\nroom for manners in his line of work. | waited until five o’clock watching\nthe minutes on the clock tick past and when five o’clock came and passed\nby with still no phone call, I couldn’t deny to myself that I wasn’t\nstricken with distress.

Fear itself is quite fear-\n\ninducing. Most intelligent people in the world dress it up as something else: optimistic denial. Most who\navoid quitting their jobs entertain the thought that their course will improve with time or increases in\nincome. This seems valid and is a tempting hallucination when a job is boring or uninspiring instead of\npure hell. Pure hell forces action, but anything less can be endured with enough clever rationalization.\n\nDo you really think it will improve or is it wishful thinking and an excuse for inaction? If you were\nconfident in improvement, would you really be questioning things so? Generally not. This is fear of the\nunknown disguised as optimism.\n\nAre you better off than you were one year ago, one month ago, or one week ago?\n\nIf not, things will not improve by themselves. If you are kidding yourself, it is time to stop and plan\nfor a jump. Barring any James Dean ending, your life is going to be LONG. Nine to five for your\nworking lifetime of 40-50 years is a long-ass time if the rescue doesn’t come. About 500 months of solid\nwork.\n\nHow many do you have to go?

The\nluxury I advocate has nothing to do with money. It cannot be bought.

There are hundreds of cars circling a parking lot, and someone pulls out\n\nof a spot 10 feet from the entrance just as you reach his or her bumper. Another Christmas miracle!\n\nOther times, the timing could be better. The phone rings during sex and seems to ring for a half hour.\nThe UPS guy shows up 10 minutes later. Bad timing can spoil the fun.\n\nJean-Marc Hachey landed in West Africa as a volunteer, with high hopes of lending a helping hand. In\nthat sense, his timing was great.

That was the program. The more your supporters loved you, the more your\nantagonists hated you. That’s how it was supposed to work. And that’s how it was\nworking.\n\nBut Trump himself was desperately wounded by his treatment in the mainstream\nmedia. He obsessed on every slight until it was overtaken by the next slight. Slights were\nsingled out and replayed again and again, his mood worsening with each replay (he was\nalways rerunning the DVR). Much of the president’s daily conversation was a repetitive\nrundown of what various anchors and hosts had said about him. And he was upset not only\nwhen he was attacked, but when the people around him were attacked. But he did not\ncredit their loyalty, or blame himself or the nature of liberal media for the indignities\nheaped on his staffers; he blamed them and their inability to get good press.\n\nMainstream media’s self-righteousness and contempt for Trump helped provide a\ntsunami of clicks for right-wing media. But an often raging, self-pitying, tormented\npresident had not gotten this memo, or had failed to comprehend it. He was looking for\nmedia love everywhere. In this, Trump quite profoundly seemed unable to distinguish\nbetween his political advantage and his personal needs—he thought emotionally, not\nstrategically.\n\nThe great value of being president, in his view, was that you’re the most famous man in\nthe world, and fame is always venerated and adored by the media. Isn’t it? But,\nconfusingly, Trump was president in large part because of his particular talent, conscious\nor reflexive, to alienate the media, which then turned him into a figure reviled by the\nmedia. This was not a dialectical space that was comfortable for an insecure man.\n\n“For Trump,” noted Ailes, “the media represented power, much more so than politics,\nand he wanted the attention and respect of its most powerful men. Donald and I were\nreally quite good friends for more than 25 years, but he would have preferred to be friends\nwith Murdoch, who thought he was a moron—at least until he became president.”\n\nOOK Ok\n\nThe White House Correspondents’ Dinner was set for April 29, the one hundredth day of\nthe Trump administration. The annual dinner, once an insiders’ event, had become an\nopportunity for media organizations to promote themselves by recruiting celebrities—\nmost of whom had nothing to do with journalism or politics—to sit at their tables. This\nhad resulted in a notable Trump humiliation when, in 2011, Barack Obama singled out\nTrump for particular mockery. In Trump lore, this was the insult that pushed him to make\nthe 2016 run.\n\nNot long after the Trump team’s arrival in the White House, the Correspondents’\nDinner became a cause for worry. On a winter afternoon in Kellyanne Conway’s upstairs\nWest Wing office, Conway and Hope Hicks engaged in a pained discussion about what to\ndo.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020032\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I couldn’t help wondering\nwhether, despite our nearly daily exercises, and my nightly stock-taking, I'd\nsomehow missed an obvious detail in our planning. When we got back to the\nsayeret base, Avraham was waiting for us. “Well?” he asked Meir. “They don’t\nneed me,” he said. “They know what they’re doing.” It was not just a source of\nreassurance for me, but a huge relief for Avraham.\n\nThe team I’d inherited from Tubul included three gifted soldiers with\ndifferent backgrounds, and different skills. Motti Nagar was born in Cairo. He\nwas short but solidly built, smart, level-headed and almost always smiling. Kuti\nSharabi grew up in a Yemeni family in an impoverished neighborhood in Tel\nAviv. He had a self-deprecating sense of humor, a quick mind and sometimes\neven quicker tongue, but an extraordinary ability to focus on the task at hand.\nThe third member was a kibbutznik. His name was Moshe Elimelech. We called\nhim Moshiko. Utterly self-contained, a man who spoke only when absolutely\nnecessary, he also brought two different qualities to the mission. One was going\nto be indispensable: an almost squirrel-like ability to climb trees. Or telephone\npoles. The other, of which I was a bit more leery, was a total, deeply irrational,\nabsence of fear.\n\nThough none of us needed a further reminder of the weight being attached to\nour mission, the night before we headed north, Avraham got a call from the\nchief-of- staff's office. Tzvi Tzur wanted to see me the next morning for a\npersonal briefing. I tried to get Avraham to say no. I pointed out that if we\ndidn’t get going by ten o’clock at the latest, we’d risk throwing everything off\nschedule. But “no” was not an option. After some further back-and-forth, it was\nagreed that I would meet the commander of Israel’s armed forces at nine the\nnext morning at a gas station north of Tel Aviv and join him for the 20-minute\ndrive along the coastal road to a speaking engagement he had in Netanya.\n\nI saw Avraham again before I set off. “We are beginning an extremely\ncritical 24 hours for our unit, the intelligence corps, in fact for the armed forces\nas a whole,” he told me. “I don’t know what might happen. No one does. Just\nremember two things. First, out there, in the field, you are the ramatkal” — the\nchief of staff. He told me that only I and my team could judge and respond to\nwhat we encountered once the operation started. “And second, this mission has\nto be accomplished.”\n\nI left see the real ramatkal. Before we began the drive to Netanya, he asked\nme to unfold the map I'd brought with me and talk him through, step by step,\nhow we planned to get onto the Golan, plant the bugging device, and get back\n\n66\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011537\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I also don't see why we should ridicule religious dogma, just as I don't think we \nshould ridicule the much more pernicious secular dogmas. Rather, we should respond to irrational belief with \nargument and evidence, while recognizing that their advocates (like most of the intellectual world in the case of secular \ndogma) are people who we should be responding to but without ridiculing them. It may be hard sometimes. For \nexample, when the icon and founding father of sober non-sentimental Realism in International Affairs informs us that \nthe US, unlike other countries, has a \"transcendental purpose,\" and the fact that it constantly acts in contradiction to \nits purpose doesn't matter because the facts are just \"abuse of history\" while real history is \"the evidence of history as \nour minds reflect it,\" then it's hard to avoid ridicule.

The message,\nin other words, does not adequately convey the stakes of the game.\n\nWiener primarily warned of the social risks—trisks stemming from careless\nintegration of machine-generated decisions with governance processes and misuse (by\nhumans) of such automated decision making. Likewise, the current “serious” debate\nabout AI risks focuses mostly on things like technological unemployment or biases in\nmachine learning. While such discussions can be valuable and address pressing short-\nterm problems, they are also stunningly parochial. I’m reminded of Yudkowsky’s quip in\na blog post: “[A]sking about the effect of machine superintelligence on the conventional\nhuman labor market is like asking how US—Chinese trade patterns would be affected by\nthe Moon crashing into the Earth. There would indeed be effects, but you’d be missing\nthe point.”\n\nIn my view, the central point of the AI risk is that superintelligent AI is an\nenvironmental risk. Allow me to explain.\n\nIn his “Parable of the Sentient Puddle,” Douglas Adams describes a puddle that\nwakes up in the morning and finds himself in a hole that fits him “staggeringly well.”\nFrom that observation, the puddle concludes that the world must have been made for him.\nTherefore, writes Adams, “the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise.” To\nassume that AI risks are limited to adverse social developments is to make a similar\nmistake. The harsh reality is that the universe was not made for us; instead, we are fine-\ntuned by evolution to a very narrow range of environmental parameters. For instance, we\nneed the atmosphere at ground level to be roughly at room temperature, at about 100 kPa\npressure, and have a sufficient concentration of oxygen. Any disturbance, even\ntemporary, of this precarious equilibrium and we die in a matter of minutes.\n\nSilicon-based intelligence does not share such concerns about the environment.\nThat’s why it’s much cheaper to explore space using machine probes rather than “cans of\nmeat.” Moreover, Earth’s current environment is almost certainly suboptimal for what a\nsuperintelligent AI will greatly care about: efficient computation. Hence we might find\nour planet suddenly going from anthropogenic global warming to machinogenic global\ncooling. One big challenge that AI safety research needs to deal with is how to constrain\na potentially superintelligent AI—an AI with a much larger footprint than our own—from\nrendering our environment uninhabitable for biological life-forms.\n\nInterestingly, given that the most potent sources both of AI research and AlI-risk\ndismissals are under big corporate umbrellas, if you squint hard enough the “AI as an\nenvironmental risk” message looks like the chronic concern about corporations skirting\ntheir environmental responsibilities.\n\nConversely, the worry about AI’s social effects also misses most of the upside.\nIt’s hard to overemphasize how tiny and parochial the future of our planet is, compared\nwith the full potential of humanity.

Moreover, the complex pattern of these connections is very\nmeaningful. (See our next point.) Computer units typically make only a handful\nof connections, in regular, fixed patterns.\n\ne Development (self-assembly with interactive sculpting): The human brain grows\nits units by cell divisions and orchestrates them into coherent structures by\nmovement and folding. It also proliferates an abundance of connections among\nthe cells. An important part of its sculpting occurs through active processes\nduring infancy and childhood, as the individual interacts with his or her\nenvironment. In this process, many connections are winnowed away, while others\nare strengthened, depending on their effectiveness in use. Thus, the fine structure\nof the brain is tuned through interaction with the external world—a rich source of\ninformation and feedback!\n\ne /ntegration (sensors and actuators): The human brain comes equipped with a\nvariety of sensory organs, notably including its outgrowth eyes, and with versatile\nactuators, including hands that build, legs that walk, and mouths that speak.\nThose sensors and actuators are seamlessy integrated into the brain’s information-\nprocessing centers, having been honed over millions of years of natural selection.\nWe interpret their raw signals and control their large-scale actions with minimal\nconscious attention. The flip side is that we don’t know how we do it, and the\nimplementation is opaque. It’s proving surprisingly difficult to reach human\nstandards on these “routine” input-output functions.\n\nThese advantages of human brains over currently engineered artifacts are\nprofound. Human brains supply an inspiring existence proof, showing us several ways\nwe can get more out of matter. When, if ever, will our engineering catch up?\n\nI don’t know for sure, but let me offer some informed opinions. The challenges\nof three-dimensionality and, to a lesser extent, self-repair don’t look overwhelming.\n\nThey present some tough engineering problems, but many incremental improvements are\neasy to imagine, and there are clear paths forward. And while the powers of human eyes,\nhands, and other sensory organs and actuators are wonderfully effective, their abilities are\nfar from exhausting any physical limits. Optical systems can take pictures with higher\nresolution in space, time, and color, and in more regions of the electromagnetic spectrum;\nrobots can move faster and be stronger; and so forth. In these domains, the components\nnecessary for superhuman performance, along many axes, are already available. The\nbottleneck is getting information into and out of them, rapidly, in the language of the\ninformation-processing units.\n\nAnd this brings us to the remaining, and I think most profound, advantages of\nbrains over artificial devices, which stem from their connectivity and interactive\ndevelopment. Those two advantages are synergistic, since it is interactive development\nthat sculpts the massively wired but sprawling structure of the infant brain, enabled by\nexponential growth of neurons and synapses, to get tuned into the extraordinary\ninstrument it becomes. Computer scientists are beginning to discover the power of the\nbrain’s architecture: Neural nets, whose basic design, as their name suggests, was directly\ninspired by the brain’s, have scored some spectacular successes in game playing and\npattern recognition, as noted. But present-day engineering has nothing comparable—in\n\n60\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016863\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Trump was soon, and obviously,\ndistracted, and as the lecture continued he began sulking.\n\n“That guy bores the shit out of me,” announced Trump after McMaster left the room.\nBut Kushner pushed him to take another meeting with McMaster, who the next day\nshowed up without his uniform and in a baggy suit.\n\n“He looks like a beer salesman,” Trump said, announcing that he would hire McMaster\nbut didn’t want to have another meeting with him.\n\nShortly after his appointment, McMaster appeared on Morning Joe. Trump saw the\nshow and noted admiringly, “The guy sure gets good press.”\n\nThe president decided he had made a good hire.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nBy midmorning on April 4, a full briefing had been assembled at the White House for the\npresident about the chemical attacks. Along with his daughter and Powell, most members\nof the president’s inner national security circle saw the bombing of Khan Sheikhoun as a\nstraightforward opportunity to register an absolute moral objection. The circumstance was\nunequivocal: Bashar al-Assad’s government, once again defying international law, had\nused chemical weapons. There was video documenting the attack and substantial\nagreement among intelligence agencies about Assad’s responsibility. The politics were\nright: Barack Obama failed to act when confronted with a Syrian chemical attack, and now\nTrump could. The downside was small; it would be a contained response. And it had the\nadded advantage of seeming to stand up to the Russians, Assad’s effective partners in\nSyria, which would score a political point at home.\n\nBannon, at perhaps his lowest moment of influence in the White House—many still\nfelt that his departure was imminent—was the only voice arguing against a military\nresponse. It was a purist’s rationale: keep the United States out of intractable problems,\nand certainly don’t increase our involvement in them. He was holding the line against the\nrising business-as-usual faction, making decisions based on the same set of assumptions,\nBannon believed, that had resulted in the Middle East quagmire. It was time to break the\nstandard-response pattern of behavior, represented by the Jarvanka-Powell-Cohn-\nMcMaster alliance. Forget normal—in fact, to Bannon, normal was precisely the problem.\n\nThe president had already agreed to McMaster’s demand that Bannon be removed from\nthe National Security Council, though the change wouldn’t be announced until the\nfollowing day. But Trump was also drawn to Bannon’s strategic view: Why do anything, if\nyou don’t have to? Or, why would you do something that doesn’t actually get you\nanything? Since taking office, the president had been developing an intuitive national\nsecurity view: keep as many despots who might otherwise screw you as happy as possible.\nA self-styled strongman, he was also a fundamental appeaser. In this instance, then, why\ncross the Russians?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020026\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Attending various dinner parties, mostly with\nother esteemed billionaires and widely acclaimed scientists. Jeffrey likes\nto surround himself with the most brilliant and powerful of minds, filling\nhis little black book with some of the most esteemed and even infamous\npeople in today’s wealthy society. It was during those intellectual\ngatherings that my body was also put on the banquet menu but this time\nfor a powerful senator George Mitchell and another prominent Nobel-\nPrize winning scientist who’s name would be mentioned but for all the\nlife of me can no longer remember. They would be only some of the\nrecognizable figures of the high society that became added to my list of\nclientele, of course being introduced to for a lot more than just a client of\nmassage.\n\nAs an amusement to Jeffrey’s associates I also knew my place was to\nentertain but not to every desired content. I was to show them a good time\nbut not the way I would have to use technique and effort for Jeffrey. The\nvery teachings from Jeffrey himself, or my tutor, as he liked to so\neloquently put it. Consistently being used and adored for the likeliness of\nmy youthful looks I was becoming very accustomed to my lifestyle with\nJeffrey, never really relaxing into it, but just accepting this as being as\ngood as it will ever get for me. 1 didn’t think J should be complaining,\nwasn't I being offered a life in exchange for servitude? Just letting the\nsigns of my anxiety and depression pass me by while I blanketed them\nwith my pills, suffocating under a blanket of pain is all IT was really doing.\n\nI spent Christmas and the New Years holidays with Jeffrey in N.Y.C,\nwho doesn’t celebrate the occasion, as he is of Jewish descent. Not that\nhe was a religious man anyways, I never even saw him celebrate\nHanukah either. We firstly stayed at his ranch in Santa Fe for a week,\nthen left for a long plane trip to Paris, France where we all suffered jet lag\nfor the next twenty four hours. We all stayed in a grand hotel with a view\nthe Champs’ Elyse.\n\nEmmy and | shared a room and with her gifted ability to make new\ncontacts in just a few hours, she brought out a jay to share on the rooftop\nat nighttime while we were overlooking the lit up Eiffel Tower. We never\ngot really close as buddies but we both knew what we were indebted to\nand felt each other’s sorrows. All four of us went out shopping at Chanel,\nD&G, Ralph Lauren, and many other little exclusive boutiques the\nfollowing afternoon. As a gift Jeffrey bought me a white terry clothed\ngoose feathered sofa and had it sent back to my apartment in Florida, and\nbought some new tapestries to have sent back to Santa Fe for his ranch.\n\n71\n\n(1 Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004204\n\nWe also visited his up and coming Paris apartment. It was a modern,\ntypical flat being refurbished, and we went to see how it was all looking.\nJeffrey liked to fuss about every detail and harass the builder’s about their\nwork, changing last minute details at a whim.\n\nDays and many croissants later we left for Spain feeling bloated and\nsleepy. We only stayed in Spain for the afternoon, going to see another\nastounding Moroccan castle for Jeffrey to replicate at one of his many\nmansions. It was only a short plane ride to Tangier, Africa for more\ncastles hopping. We arrived at the historic landmark and the only five star\nhotel in Tangier called E] Minzah in the village of Ville Nouvelle. The\ncity and outskirts were still very hostile at the time, females being warned\nto not walk the streets alone and not to leave the house after dark or be at\nrisk of being raped or worse.\n\nWhen we got to the room, it was oozing with every expected bit of\nextravagance that a luxurious historical palace should offer until I was\ngreeted with a pile of monkey poo in the very middle of my bed. Not a\nhappy camper I called Jeffrey, Ghislane and Emmy into my adjoining\nroom and they all had quite a good laugh at my expense. Within a\nmoments notice of a complaint call to the front desk and we had an\nattendant cleaning up my bed linen. The cleaner noticed the window was\nstill opened, he warned not to leave it ajar at nighttime just in case\nanother monkey wanted to make himself comfortable in my quarters.\n\nGhislane joked that maybe | should keep it open I might find a suitable\nhusband before I get any older. Always the instigator of a good joke but\nunable to take one herself she didn’t like when I poked back that it was\nmore in her recent taste of men, since she loved to brag about her\nrendezvous with her various lovers. Once she came back giddy as a\nschoolgirl with an explosion of news, with all the build up and excitement\nin her voice you’d think she was the next crown princess, but she had\ngiven George Clooney a blowjob in the bathroom at some random event,\nshe never let that one down.\n\nWe all went to explore the towns surrounding Moroccan castles and\nmeet their royalty that lived in them. Jeffrey’s personal interior designer’s\nmet us at the residences. They walked around hurriedly, scribbling notes\ninto their clipboards and whispering between themselves.

But, most likely, you did not follow my instruction.\nThis is a form of social self-censorship. I asked you to do something rather\ndifficult and embarrassing, but very creative and likely to enlighten you.\nSadly most people — I am no exception — tend to censor their creativity\nfor fear of embarrassment. Children, of course, do not sensor themselves\nas much as adults.\n\nNow you know how to be more creative. Find your inner child and\ndon't censor yourself too much!\n\nWhat Sparks Creativity\n\nAs an inventor, I’m often asked what makes me creative. How do I do it?\nThe answer is, I have no real process. After all, a process is mechanical\nand this entire book has been about exploring how creativity is a non-\nmechanical task. However, there are many things you can do to unleash\nyour creative potential.\n\nNew ideas are often sparked through linking disparate ideas. Expose\nyourself to as many ideas as you can, read widely, attend conferences,\nvisit customers.\n\nCreativity requires peace and quiet. I personally get up early every\nmorning. This gives me a good two hours of uninterrupted time every\nday. It’s also the part of the day when my brain works best. Others prefer\nto work late into the night.\n\nPressure, for me and for many people, is a great incentive. Tales of\nthe Polish Enigma code breakers, Douglas Adams’ writing deadlines and\nthe fear of impending death in shark attack stories all force people to\nthink in an accelerated way. This appears to help many people defeat the\nhuman tendency to prevaricate.\n\nOn the other hand avoid panic. While a level of pressure can help,\npanic is unproductive. There is a sweet spot between having enough time\nto get properly acquainted with a problem and an impending deadline\nto force the crystallization of ideas. This balance varies from person to\nperson and is something you need to test for yourself.\n\nYou need time off. Once you have a well thought out idea, you\nmay need to leave it alone for a while to allow your subconscious to\nwork. Time off does not need to be two weeks at the beach. Charles\nDarwin and Benjamin Britten used to go for long walks. You can walk in\nDarwin's footsteps at Down House in Kent.

The advent of deep learning—\nin which computers, in effect, teach themselves to be smarter by observing tons of data,\nhas given him pause, because this method lacks transparency.\n\nWhile recognizing the impressive achievements in deep learning by colleagues\nsuch as Michael Jordan and Geoffrey Hinton, he feels uncomfortable with this kind of\nopacity. He set out to understand the theoretical limitations of deep-learning systems\nand points out that basic barriers exist that will prevent them from achieving a human\nkind of intelligence, no matter what we do. Leveraging the computational benefits of\nBayesian networks, Judea realized that the combination of simple graphical models and\ndata could also be used to represent and infer cause-effect relationships. The\nsignificance of this discovery far transcends its roots in artificial intelligence. His latest\nbook explains causal thinking to the general public; you might say it is a primer on how\nto think even though human.\n\nJudea’s principled, mathematical approach to causality is a profound\ncontribution to the realm of ideas.

For example, the integrative diagram\ntakes LIDA as a model of working memory and reactive processing, but from the papers on\nLIDA it’s unclear whether the creators of LIDA construe it more broadly than that. The deep\nlearning community tends to believe that the architecture of current deep learning networks,\nin itself, is close to sufficient for human-level general intelligence — whereas the integrative\ndiagram appropriates the ideas from this community mainly for handling perception, action\nand language, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, in a more positive perspective, one could view the integrative diagram\nas consistent with LIDA, but merely providing much more detail on some of the boxes in the\nLIDA diagram (e.g. dealing with perception and long-term memory). And one could view the\nintegrative diagram as consistent with the deep learning paradigm — via viewing it, not as\na description of components to be explicitly implemented in an AGI system, but rather as a\ndescription of the key structures and processes that must emerge in deep learning network, based\non its engagement with the world, in order for it to achieve human-like general intelligence.\n\nOur own view, underlying the creation of the integrative diagram, is that different commu-\nnities of cognitive science researchers have focused on different aspects of intelligence, and have\nthus each created models that are more fully fleshed out in some aspects than others. But these\nvarious models all link together fairly cleanly, which is not surprising as they are all grounded\nin the same data regarding human intelligence. Many judgment calls must be made in fusing\nmultiple models in the way that the integrative diagram does, but we feel these can be made\nwithout violating the spirit of the component models. In assembling the integrative diagram, we\nhave made these judgment calls as best we can, but we’re well aware that different judgments\nwould also be feasible and defensible. Revisions are likely as time goes on, not only due to\nnew data about human intelligence but also to evolution of understanding regarding the best\napproach to model integration.\n\nAnother possible argument against the ideas presented here is that there’s nothing new — all\nthe ingredients presented have been given before elsewhere. To this our retort is to quote Pascal:\n\"Let no one say that I have said nothing new ... the arrangement of the subject is new.\" The\nvarious architecture diagrams incorporated into the integrative diagram are either extremely\nhigh level (Sloman’s diagram) or focus primarily on one aspect of intelligence, treating the\nothers very concisely by summarizing large networks of distinction structures and processes in\nsmall boxes. The integrative diagram seeks to cover all aspects of human-like intelligence at a\nroughly equal granularity — a different arrangement.\n\nThis kind of high-level diagramming exercise is not precise enough, nor dynamics-focused\nenough, to serve as a guide for creating human-level or more advanced AGI. But it can be a\nuseful tool for explaining and interpreting a concrete AGI design, such as CogPrime.\n\n5.3 An Architecture Diagram for Human-Like General Intelligence\n\nThe integrative diagram is presented here in a series of seven Figures.\n\nFigure 5.1 gives a high-level breakdown into components, based on Sloman’s high-level\ncognitive-architectural sketch [Slo01].

Would we relax, saying that it’s a problem that can be set\non one side for 50 years — people will then be richer, and it may turn out then that it’s\ngoing to miss the Earth anyway?

But even if they’re\nhonoured, this may not happen fast enough to prevent CO2 concentrations rising to\ndangerous levels.\n\nPoliticians seldom take a long-term view, and won't gain much resonance by\nadvocating unwelcome lifestyle changes now — when the benefits accrue mainly to\ndistant parts of the world, and are decades into the future.\n\nBut there’s one measures to mitigate climate change that genuinely seems a ‘win win’\nscenario.\n\nCLEANER ENERGY SOURCES\n\nIt’s that nations should accelerate R and D into all forms of low-carbon energy\ngeneration (renewables, , 4\"th generation nuclear, fusion, and the rest) . And into\nother technologies where parallel progress is crucial — especially storage (batteries,\ncompressed air, pumped storage, flywheels, etc) and smart grids. That’ why an\nencouraging outcome of Paris was an initiative called ‘Mission Innovation’. It was\nlaunched by President Obama and by the Indian Prime Minister Modi. And endorsed\nby 20 other nations. It’s a campaign to double publicly funded R and D into clean\nenergy by 2020. There’s been a parallel pledge by Bill Gates and other private\nphilanthropists.\n\nThis target is a modest one . Presently, only 2 percent of publicly funded R and D is\ndevoted to these challenges. Why shouldn’t the percentage be comparable to\nspending on medical or defence research?\n\nThe faster these ‘clean’ technologies advance, the sooner will their prices fall so they\nbecome affordable to developing countries - where more generating capacity will be\nneeded -- where the health of the poorest billions is jeopardized by smoky stoves\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026735\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Subfields such as\nlogical planning, robotics, and natural-language understanding are special cases of the\ngeneral paradigm. AI has incorporated probability theory to handle uncertainty, utility\ntheory to define objectives, and statistical learning to allow machines to adapt to new\ncircumstances. These developments have created strong connections to other disciplines\nthat build on similar concepts, including control theory, economics, operations research,\nand statistics.\n\nIn both the logical-planning and rational-agent views of AI, the machine’s\nobjective—whether in the form of a goal, a utility function, or a reward function (as in\nreinforcement learning)—1s specified exogenously. In Wiener’s words, this is “the\npurpose put into the machine.” Indeed, it has been one of the tenets of the field that AI\nsystems should be general-purpose—i.e., capable of accepting a purpose as input and\nthen achieving it—rather than special-purpose, with their goal implicit in their design.\nFor example, a self-driving car should accept a destination as input instead of having one\nfixed destination. However, some aspects of the car’s “driving purpose” are fixed, such\nas that it shouldn’t hit pedestrians. This is built directly into the car’s steering algorithms\nrather than being explicit: No self-driving car in existence today “knows” that pedestrians\nprefer not to be run over.\n\nPutting a purpose into a machine which optimizes its behavior according to clearly\ndefined algorithms seems an admirable approach to ensuring that the machine’s “conduct\nwill be carried out on principles acceptable to us!” But, as Wiener warns, we need to put\nin the right purpose. We might call this the King Midas problem: Midas got exactly what\nhe asked for—namely, that everything he touched would turn to gold—but too late he\ndiscovered the drawbacks of drinking liquid gold and eating solid gold. The technical\nterm for putting in the right purpose is value alignment. When it fails, we may\ninadvertently imbue machines with objectives counter to our own. Tasked with finding a\ncure for cancer as fast as possible, an AI system might elect to use the entire human\npopulation as guinea pigs for its experiments. Asked to de-acidify the oceans, it might\nuse up all the oxygen in the atmosphere as a side effect. This is a common characteristic\nof systems that optimize: Variables not included in the objective may be set to extreme\nvalues to help optimize that objective.\n\nUnfortunately, neither AI nor other disciplines (economics, statistics, control\ntheory, operations research) built around the optimization of objectives have much to say\nabout how to identify the purposes “we really desire.” Instead, they assume that\nobjectives are simply implanted into the machine. AI research, in its present form,\nstudies the ability to achieve objectives, not the design of those objectives.\n\nSteve Omohundro has pointed to a further difficulty, observing that intelligent\nentities must act to preserve their own existence. This tendency has nothing to do with a\nself-preservation instinct or any other biological notion; it’s just that an entity cannot\nachieve its objectives if it’s dead. According to Omohundro’s argument, a\nsuperintelligent machine that has an off-switch—which some, including Alan Turing\nhimself, in a 1951 talk on BBC Radio 3, have seen as our potential salvation—will take\nsteps to disable the switch in some way.! Thus we may face the prospect of\nsuperintelligent machines—their actions by definition unpredictable by us and their\n\n' Omohundro, “The Basic AI Drives,” in Proc.

I turn down most celebrity requests, and cases involving celebrity clients form a tiny\nfraction of my practice over the years, but the few that I do take garner far more publicity than do\nthe many cases involving unknown clients.\n\nIs there anything special about famous clients—celebrities? Should “high profile” cases be\nhandled differently from less visible controversies? These are questions I have pondered during\nmy career as a lawyer.\n\nMost people see celebrities at a distance — on the screen, stage, television, athletic field, or\nauditorium. They see them at their best — acting, posing, playing, speaking, being interviewed or\nparticipating in charitable causes.\n\nI see celebrities close up and at their worst. They come to me when they are in trouble, often\ndeep trouble. Their celebrity is no longer a shield protecting them from the ordinary tribulations\nthat befall most people on a daily basis. When they come to me, their celebrity has been turned\ninto a sword being wielded against them. Celebrities generally live by publicity. When they come\nto me, they are dying from the publicity and want privacy and anonymity. But they can’t have it,\nbecause the very celebrity that brought them fame and fortune now threatens to magnify their\nproblems.\n\nI have represented, advised and consulted with dozens of celebrities, ranging from Presidents and\nPrime Ministers to world famous athletes, actors, writers and financiers. Most have gotten into\ntrouble for one overarching reason: because they were willing to risk what they have limited\namounts of in order to obtain more of what they have unlimited amounts of.\n\nThis may sound self-defeating, if not bizarre—so let me explain. Celebrities share several\ncommon characteristics. They have more of something than ordinary people have: great athletes\nhave extraordinary physical skills; good actors have unusual thespian skills; successful politicians\nhave a special charisma; financiers have money and the ability to make more. These special\ncharacteristics generally give celebrities access to certain desiderata of life: lots of money and the\nthings money and fame buy, and the benefits that come with these commodities, such as access to\nnumerous sexual partners — if they choose to use their celebrity to obtain such access (and\nexcess!)\n\nMany of my celebrity clients, who have unlimited amounts of money or access to sex, have\nsacrificed what they have limited amounts of — freedom, career, time with loved ones, health — in\norder to obtain even more money or sex. Let me provide a few examples of such bizarre risk-\ntaking in cases that are a matter of public record.

Research shows bi-directional causality between neuropsychiatric disorders and sleep disorders.\nThis is a superb example of how fundamental science breakthroughs lead to clinical breakthroughs. This fact\nthat REM is associated with emotional memories is nicely consistent with the apparent psychotic nature of\ndreams, because in REM Sleep the frontal cortex is ‘down-regulated’ (and the frontal cortex is associated with\nrational planning, reflection, controlling impulses), while in REM Sleep the limbic system is “up-regulated”\n(and the limbic system is associated with emotions and feelings) — see Neuroimaging below. This is\n\nwhy dream states flood the ego with emotional fantasies without rational control. However, it is also true that\nthe limbic system enables creative ideas, thus grounding in science the long-suspected idea that sleep and\ndreams can enhance creativity.\n\nAs Dr. Robert Stickgold, our other advisor on the series, wrote: “It would be nice if we could talk about sleep\nand memory as if there were only one type of memory and one type of sleep. But this is far from the case.\nSleep and memory each comes in many forms, and furthermore, memories can go through multiple forms of\npost-encoding processing that must be individually addressed.”\n\nImmunity / Immune System. Strengthening the immune system is now a proven product of NREM sleep.\nDiscerning the evolutionary basis for this is a key research project (1.e., it seems counter-intuitive\n\nthat sleeping facilitates fitness for survival in that predators lurked in the jungles and on the plains so that\ngoing unconscious during sleep does not, at first glance, seem especially adaptive). Studies of sleep in various\nnon-human animals reveals a direct relationship between longer periods of NREM (Slow-Wave) Sleep and a\nstronger immune system, especially in fighting parasites. NREM Sleep releases molecules that\n\nfight inflection; NREM Sleep works for the maintenance, repair and activation of the immune system. (This\ngives scientific rationale for the need or desire to sleep during illnesses.) Related are “genetic conflict” studies\nwith respect to REM and NREM, showing differences in heredity between material and paternal lines, and\ndifferences between males and females in which genes get “imprinted”.\n\nNeuroplasticity. Exciting recent research has reversed the century-long conventional wisdom that new\nneurons are never created in adult animals/humans. The development of new neurons — neuronogenesis — is a\nvital part of maintaining normal brain and mental functioning. New neurons are being created, importantly, in\nthe hippocampus (brain organ where new memories are encoded) — but, remarkably, the neuronogensis in\n\nthe hippocampus occurs only/largely during REM Sleep — a stunning finding. This is another reason why\nREM sleep is needed for emotional memory consolidation (normal functioning).\n\nDream-Content. Although dreams have sparked human fascination and fantasy for thousands of years, only\nin very recent years, have large-scale surveys been conducted with rigorous design, classifications and\nstatistical analysis. Literally hundreds of thousands of dreams are enabling statistically significant theories,\nincluding cross-cultural analyses (similarities and differences). Dream-posting sites have revolutionized size\nand structure of dream data sets. This enables, for the first time, longitudinal studies of dreams over time.\nPatterns are repeated. For example, in general, the dreams of males and females differ in fundamental ways.\nMales will engage in fighting with other males; females with both males and females. Male dreamers\n\nare often the initiator of fights and the fights are usually physical. Females fight verbally. Aggressiveness\nby the dreamer is almost always in REM Sleep, rarely in NREM Sleep. (Why is a continuing question.)\n“Lucid Dreaming” is a new area of fascinating research. Lucid Dreaming is where the dreamer “knows” that\nhe/she is dreaming while dreaming (a talent that a small minority possesses but more can be\ntrained/developed). Lucid dreamers, while sleeping, can now communicate with experimenters by altering\ntheir brain activity and thus becoming detectable by neuroimaging techniques (see below).\n\nNeuroimaging. Finally, neuroimaging technology has enabled many of these breakthroughs. As such, it is\nitself a methodological breakthrough that has enabled these other content breakthroughs. Neuroimaging now\nenables detailed location of the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of REM and NREM Sleep. In\n\nREM Sleep, the dorsolateral, frontal cortex is “down-regulated”, whereas the limbic system is “up-regulated”,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025107\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

After reading the book I stopped talking about my dreams and immediately started setting\nshort-term and long-term goals. I bought a notebook to track my monthly goals and tasks. I did lots of\nresearch on potential remote working situations and I started telling my close friends and family about\nmy new plans. Everyone that I told thought it was just an idea and I wasn’t actually going to go through\nwith it. They thought it was a “some day I'd like to do this” idea and that I wasn’t actually setting daily\ngoals to get me there. They knew that I loved my job so why would I leave it for a life of uncertainty? I\ndidn’t think of it that way. I wasn’t scared, I was excited at the prospect of a new way of life, a fresh\nstart, and even though I loved my job I also had other things I wanted to accomplish in my life. At first I\nthought about teaching English to make a living down there, but deep down inside all I really wanted to\ndo was continue working for my current company, just doing it remotely. The book gave me the\nconfidence to think this was actually possible, when everyone around me thought it was impossible.\n\nI decided to write up a proposal and present it to my boss even at the advice not to do it from\neveryone I knew. If my boss rejected my proposal, I had enough money saved up to live in Argentina for\nat least six months to get me by until I could figure out how I wanted to make money there. I was not\ngiving up on my dream of living a freer, happier life with less work and more time for myself. All odds\nwere against me but I took a calculated risk and had faith in myself. After I handed in my proposal, I\nwas ready to expect the worst. Everyone around me was waiting with baited breath and words of\nencouragement after I got rejected. When I left the meeting with my boss I couldn’t believe it. She\naccepted and was eager to talk to me about the details. She even had a smile on her face and told me how\nawesome my proposal was. No one else could believe it when I told them. After the shock wore off, I\nrealized that I could actually do this, and a huge weight was lifted from my shoulders. The hardest part\nwas over and now I could start thinking of more possibilities for my new life.\n\nI set my goal to move to Argentina for September 2008. I arrived here on September 3 and have been\nhere for about six months now. I live in the capital city of Jujuy, Argentina, a small province in the\nnorthwest of Argentina. I work about 5—10 hours a week and [ find that I am much more focused now\nthat I am out of the office and working alone. I have a private Spanish tutor that I meet with for two\nhours, five days a week. I have a handful of friends that I spend time with, practicing my Spanish.

The idea, backed by Vice President\nAl Gore, was to reduce the size of the federal government by out-\nsourcing investigating the backgrounds of millions of government\napplicants for jobs. The task had previously been performed by the\nFBI, but it was assumed that a profit-making business could do it\nfaster and more efficiently. The private company named U.S. Inves-\ntigations Services was purchased in 2007 for $1.5 billion by Provi-\ndence Equity Partners, a rapidly expanding investment firm founded\nin 1989 by graduates of Duke, Brown University, and the Harvard\nBusiness School. So like Booz Allen, USIS was backed by a hedge\nfund determined to make money by systematically cutting the cost\nof a service previously carried out by the government.\n\nBut such outsourcing had drawbacks. For one thing, unlike the\nFBI, USIS lacked the investigative clout to gain entry to certain gov-\nernment agencies. A Congressional review found that the privacy\nact permits disclosure of government agency records to the private\n\n© firm if they are part of a “routine use of the records,” but intelligence ®\nagencies did not consider all such requests to be “routine. For exam-\nple, when it did the background check on Snowden in 2011, it could\nnot get access to his CIA file. The “derog” in his file might have set\noff alarm bells, as might the fear that he had been threatened by an\ninternal investigation over his alleged computer tampering in 2009.\nThe FBI might have learned this about Snowden if it had done his\nbackground check.\n\nThe lack of adequate oversight was another problem. USIS closed\ncases and cleared applicants without completing an adequate inves-\ntigation. According to a U.S. government suit filed in 2014, USIS\nhad prematurely closed over 665,000 investigations in order to get\npaid for them more quickly. Because the more cases it completed\neach month, the more money it received from the government, the\nlawsuit alleged that USIS employees often “flushed” or ended cases\nbefore completing a full investigation to meet corporate-imposed\nquotas for getting bonuses. One employee, in an e-mail cited in the\ngovernment’s complaint, said they “flushed everything like a dead\ngoldfish.” As a result, some information specialists entering the NSA\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r.indd 216 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019704\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

From two strongly supported hypotheses, we’ve\ndrawn a straightforward conclusion:\n\ne Human mind emerges from matter.\n\ne Matter is what physics says it is.\n\ne Therefore, the human mind emerges from physical processes we\nunderstand and can reproduce artificially.\n\ne Therefore, natural intelligence is a special case of artificial\nintelligence.\n\nOf course, our “astonishing corollary” could fail; the first two lines of this\nargument are hypotheses. But their failure would have to bring in a foundation-shattering\ndiscovery—a significant new phenomenon, with large-scale physical consequences,\nwhich takes place in unremarkable, well-studied physical circumstances (1.e., the\nmaterials, temperatures, and pressures inside human brains) yet which has somehow\nmanaged for many decades to elude determined investigators armed with sophisticated\ninstruments. Such a discovery would be. . . astonishing.\n\nID. The Future of Intelligence\n\nIt is part of human nature to improve on human bodies and minds. Historically, clothing,\neyeglasses, and watches are examples of increasingly sophisticated augmentations that\nenhance our toughness, perception, and awareness. They are major improvements to the\nnatural human endowment, whose familiarity should not blind us to their depth. Today\nsmartphones and the Internet are bringing the human drive toward augmentation into\nrealms more central to our identity as intelligent beings. They are giving us, in effect,\nquick access to a vast collective awareness and a vast collective memory.\n\nAt the same time, autonomous artificial intelligences have become world\nchampions in a wide variety of “cerebral” games, such as chess and Go, and have taken\nover many sophisticated pattern-recognition tasks, such as reconstructing what happened\nduring complex reactions at the Large Hadron Collider from a blizzard of emerging\nparticle tracks, to find new particles; or gathering clues from fuzzy X-ray, fMRI, and\nother types of images, to diagnose medical problems.\n\nWhere is this drive toward self-enhancement and innovation taking us? While the\nprecise sequence of events and the timescale over which they’ll play out is impossible to\npredict (or, at least, beyond me), some basic considerations suggest that eventually the\nmost powerful embodiments of mind will be quite different things from human brains as\nwe know them today.\n\nConsider six factors whereby information-processing technology exceeds human\ncapabilities—vastly, qualitatively, or both:\n\ne Speed: The orchestrated motion of electrons, which is the heart of modern\nartificial information-processing, can be much faster than the processes of\ndiffusion and chemical change by which brains operate. Typical modern\ncomputer clock rates approach 10 gigahertz, corresponding to 10 billion\noperations per second. No single measure of speed applies to the bewildering\nvariety of brain processes, but one fundamental limitation is latency of action\n\n58\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016278\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

If Clinton was prepared to pay $700,000 to settle a suit he regarded as utterly\nfrivolous and untrue, no greater incentive would have been added if he defaulted and paid.\n\nThe sad reality is that Robert Bennett, perhaps in his zeal to chalk up a high visibility win, failed\nor neglected to tell the president that this was one case that was better for the client to lose and\navoid testifying rather than to win and risk testifying falsely.\n\nDefaulting the Jones case would have resulted in bad headlines the next day—and perhaps for an\nadditional week. But testifying about his sex life resulted in a dangerous threat to the Clinton\npresidency — a threat which would not materialize for several months. Thus we see another\ninstance of the President making a decision which helped him in the short run — by avoiding the\nnegative headlines of a settlement or default — but hurt him greatly in the long run. It was a\npattern that would persist.\n\nOn January 26, 1998, President Clinton, with the assistance of Hollywood producer Harry\nThomason , decided to make a public statement denying a sexual relationship with Monica\nLewinsky. Pointing his finger at the TV camera for emphasis, he said:\n\n“T want you to listen to me. I’m going to say this again. I did not\n\nhave sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told\n\nanybody to lie, not a single time — never. These allegations are\n\nfalse. And I need to go back to work for the American People.”\n\nThis statement, made directly to the American public and not under oath, has come back to haunt\nClinton. Why did he make it? He was under no legal obligation to make any statement. He could\neasily have said, as so many others have said, “Since the matter is now the subject of a legal\nproceeding, my lawyers have advised me to make no public comment about it. I’m sure you\nunderstand.”\n\nBut instead, he issued a firm denial of what he would later have to admit was essentially true:\nnamely that he did, in fact, have some kind of a sexual encounter with “that woman.”\n\nOnce again, the President and his advisors opted for the quick fix. They felt that it was necessary\nto put out the political brushfire that was burning around them. By issuing a firm denial, the\nPresident could postpone — perhaps forever — the longer term consequences of his improper sex\nand his misleading testimony.

Body language allows us to convey qualitatively different things,\nsuch as trust and happiness.

It was\ngenerally holding.\n\nBut fundamentally, Arik’s war plan was not a response to the Katyushas. It\nwas a way of using military force to achieve Prime Minister Begin’s political\naim: stopping the Camp David peace process in its tracks, and ensuring it did\nnot go beyond the peace treaty with Egypt. And even that message was not\nprincipally intended for the Palestinians, I suspect, but for the Americans.\nIsrael’s Labor-led governments had always calculated that we needed at least\nsome measure of support from foreign allies, especially the US. Under Begin,\nwe'd already bombed Saddam Hussein’s nuclear reactor without telling the\nAmericans beforehand. Shortly after I returned to the kirya, he provoked further\nanger in Washington by announcing the de facto annexation of the Golan — in\neffect “balancing” our Sinai withdrawal with a dramatic reassertion of Israeli\ncontrol over other land captured in the 1967 war. Part of Arik’s plan in Lebanon\nwas to deliver an even more forceful riposte to any suggestion that we would\ngive up control of the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nYet these political aims, which I was gradually beginning to grasp in their\nfull form through my discussions with Arik, were only part of the reason I was\ndeeply uneasy about the plans for our Lebanon invasion. Having now spent\nnearly two decades in the military, I recognized that the security challenge north\nof the border was real. I did not believe it was inherently wrong for Begin’s\ngovernment to order a pre-emptive military operation with the aim of ending it.\nMy view, as an army officer, was that the decision on how, when and whether\nto go to war was for our elected government. But for that principle to work, I\nalso believed that government ministers had to know what they were deciding.\nThe more we geared up for an invasion, the less certain I became that Begin’s\ncabinet understood what we were planning to do.\n\nArik’s original plan was codenamed Oranim: Hebrew for “pine trees”. It\ninvolved pushing deep into Lebanon, all the way up to the strategically critical\nroad that ran between Beirut and Damascus. We would link up in Beirut with\nthe main Maronite Christian force, the Phalangists, whom we had been\nsupporting and training for several years. When that plan was presented to\nBegin’s cabinet at the end of 1981, however, most ministers opposed it. Thus\nwas born Arik’s Plan B, so-called “Little Pines”. Its stated aim was a lot more\nmodest. We would create a “security zone” — a 40-kilometer, or 25-mile, strip\nrunning north of the border with Lebanon.\n\n194\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028042\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

At week 24 in the same\ntrial, Praluent reduced LDL cholesterol by 43 percent compared to placebo. In this study, if additional LDL\ncholesterol lowering was required based on pre-specified criteria at week 8, Praluent was up-titrated to 150 mg\nat week 12 for the remainder of the trial. Eighty-three percent of patients remained on their initial 75 mg dose.\nPraluent is generally well-tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. Local injection site reactions including\nredness, itching, swelling or pain/tenderness where the injection is given were the most common events (7.2\npercent with Praluent versus 5.1 percent with placebo) and resulted in a low discontinuation rate that was\ncomparable to placebo (0.2 percent with Praluent versus 0.4 percent with placebo).

Then, after\nmonths of negotiations, the State reached what it believed was an appropriate resolution of the case.\nImportantly, this resolution was consistent with that of cases involving other defendants who had\nengaged in similar conduct. Implementation of the State resolution of the case was held in abeyance,\nhowever, due to the unexpected commencement of the successive federal criminal investigation.\n\nWhile it is true, as CEOS points out, (CEOS letter at p. 3) that many criminal prosecutions\nturn on issues of credibility of witnesses, to which many members of the defense team can attest\n(having had decades of federal criminal litigation experience among us), this does not serve to divest\nthe prosecutor of his/her duty to make a searching inquiry of the facts before using the power of\nprosecution, and the weight of the United States government, to level serious accusations. CEOS\nlikewise acknowledges as much, “the prosecutors are in the best position to assess the witnesses’\ncredibility.” (CEOS letter at p. 3).\n\nSince the CEOS letter also singles me out as someone who should be familiar with witness\nissues, I feel compelled to note that, of course, I am well aware that it is not uncommon for witnesses\nto give conflicting statements. Iam also fully aware that the credibility of key government witnesses\nmay be strongly impacted by the $50 million incentive provided via the civil lawsuits at play, and\nencouraged by the government here. ? I have also read many of the conflicts between witness\ntestimony and Detective ReCarey’s own rendition of that testimony in his reports and/or search\nwarrant affidavit. Detective ReCarey apparently formed a view early on as to the purported\ncriminality of Mr. Epstein’s conduct regardless of the mountain of evidence to the contrary. For a\nprosecutor that has had an opportunity to review the full facts, and to meet with the witnesses,\nhowever, “conflicting statements” cross the line to a “lack of credibility” that simply can not sustain\na prosecution. That is where an appropriate application of prosecutorial discretion must be brought\nto bear.\n\nAgain, CEOS was not itself in the position to exercise such discretion. By its own admission,\nCEOS did not make a full review of the witness statements here, and CEOS certainly did not sit\ndown across the table and speak to these witnesses. We understand that was apparently not its\nperceived role. But, CEOS should recognize that at least one prosecutor in this case — the Chief of\nthe SAO Sex Crimes Division has done so. Lana Belohlavek not only met with and interviewed\nthese witnesses during the course of the 15-month state investigation prior to any federal\ninvolvement, but she again sat across the table from many of them in connection with recent civil\n\n3 It is important to note here that this investigation was launched not upon the complaint of any alleged victim, but,\nrather, upon the complaint of (thcr, I, and her — —« More\nnotable still is the fact that [ME has been convicted of federal bank fraud, an has a state\n.

Jets belonging to TWA, Pan Am and Swissair were seized by the Popular Front\nfor the Liberation of Palestine. The group also attempted to hijack a jet over London belonging to the\nIsraeli airline El Al but was thwarted by security guards on board.\n\nThe Pan Am seizure ended quickly, but the passengers on the TWA and Swissair jets were diverted\nto a British air base in Jordan and the drama only ended after days of tense diplomacy, when the\nhostages were all released in a deal in which the Swiss, German, British and Israeli governments let\n\nPalestinian prisoners go.\" (http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/27/politics/terrorism-19 70s-richard-\nnixon/index.html)\n\nThis 9/11 response sounds quite normal of course.

The U.S. informed Secretary General Hammarskjold that it did not\nfavor any action by the UN to revise the present calendar. ‘Large numbers of the US\ncitizens oppose the plan,’ the U.S. note said. “Their opposition is based on religious\ngrounds...””\n\nWe were thrilled that our campaign—involving hundreds not quite the “large numbers”\nreported—had succeeded. We regarded it as a victory for religious freedom. It persuaded me\nthat even small efforts could have an impact on large organizations—a lesson that has stayed with\nme over my career. And it enhanced my admiration for the U.N., which had shown sensitivity to\nreligious minorities.\n\nDuring my high school years, my class made several visits to the U.N., where we watched the\nGeneral Assembly in action.

I\nmarched, attended rallies, trained for civil rights work in the South, and briefly traveled to points\nof confrontation in several southern cities, while carefully remaining out of harm’s way.\n\nAfter becoming a teacher and a lawyer, my involvement in the human rights movement\nbroadened, both academically and politically.\n\nIn my academic work, I began to explore the meaning of the term “human rights,” as contrasted\nwith “civil rights,” “civil liberties,” and “political rights.” To be an advocate of “human” rights\nmeant to me going beyond one’s particular group. A Jew who fights only against anti-Semitism is\nan advocate for particular rights, as is an African-American who struggles only against racism, a\nwoman who only opposes sexism, or a gay person who limits his advocacy to gay rights.

When I say “Mill’s idea”, from now on, | will mean some of both.\n\nNo one had the data to prove him right until national accounts began reporting\nmarket-valued capital in 1990 or so, and reconstructing it for a few decades before.\nWhat they had earlier was the book measures of capital that we see in balance\nsheets. They don’t reveal enough. Book measures assume depreciation norms.\nOutcomes converge to norms over time, but meanwhile might be anything. National\naccounts follow a form of this book or depreciation accounting. They now report\nmarket-valued capital too, but still prefer book methods to calculate investment I\nand output Y in the Y = C + I equation. That doesn’t work well.

In the boom year 1933, when stock\nmarkets were up 42%, 67%, 96% and 46% in those four countries, Germany and U.S.\nreported net investment (capital growth) as negative while France and U.K.\nreported it up less than half a percent. All this shows in my charts and tables.\nReports of net investment in national accounts tend to prove radically wrong in\nyears of unexpected upturn or downturn because they don’t get the news of wars or\nnational disasters or discoveries or business cycles until new assets are bought or\nnew products sold. Purchases and sales are normally the only input into the books.\nAverage time between original purchase and realization in sales is the “holding\nperiod” or “turnover period” of capital. For all physical capital together, it runs\nseveral years.

Our offices were along the\nsame hallway of the Airya, the ministry’s headquarters in the heart of Tel Aviv.\nRabin had a very low table in his office, with two chairs. We would sit across\nfrom each other, each with a ready supply of coffee and Yitzhak smoking an\napparently endless supply of cigarettes, and we would just talk. Politics.\nStrategy. Israel. The PLO. The surrounding Arab states. And the wider world.\n\nMany years before I became Prime Minister, I gave a lecture at a memorial\nmeeting for an Israeli academic. Not many people were there. I doubt even they\nremember it. But I do, because what I said has, sadly, become more prophetic\nthan even I could have imagined. I talked about the imperative for peace as part\nof Israel’s security. There was a “window,” I said. We were militarily strong. In\nregional terms, we were a superpower. But politically, resolving the conflict\nwith our Arab enemies would almost certainly become more difficult with time.\n\n9\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011480\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Yoram Ben-Porath combined these ideas and more in a masterly life-\n\ncycle model published in 1967. We'll get to it soon.\n\nSchultz called the part of consumption exhausted in taste satisfaction “pure\nconsumption”. The part invested in human capital was “pure investment”. I change\nthat to “invested consumption” to avoid confusion with investment in physical\ncapital. Since there is no settled term for the part of work invested in learning, | call\nit “self-invested work”. I call the part of work sold for pay “realized work”.

I agree,\nwith a clarification as to possible deadweight loss that I'll come to in Chapter 6. I call\nit the Ben-Porath equation, although he drew it from the Schultz-led consensus. It is\n\nreally a summary of the first four of the equations in his 1967 paper taken together.\n\nThis explains my critique of the Y=I+C equation. The equation would be true if\nhuman capital growth equaled invested consumption. In fact it equals that plus self-\ninvested work less human depreciation. The corrected equation would read “output\nequals consumption plus investment plus self-invested work less human\n\ndepreciation”. | call this the “Y rule”.\n\nUpending the Y =! + C equation is big news.

It doesn’t follow that national\naccounts in themselves need much change, aside from reporting net investment at\nmarket as well as at book, because accountants must measure what they can.\nHuman depreciation and self-invested work elude market measurement. But\neconomists can allow for them, and they are huge flows. Human depreciation is\ndepreciation of the larger factor. And self-invested work includes more than\nlearning. Ben-Porath showed, as we will see, that it equals all growth in human\n\ncapital not explained by inflows of nurture and schooling less outflows in human\n\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 12\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010952\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

They didn’t bother getting married until the summer of 1941. Perhaps\nbecause this was less than nine months before I was born, my mother always\nremained vague when asked their exact wedding date.\n\nMy parents were an unlikely pair. My mother — bright, lively and energetic —\nwas a doer, who believed passionately in the grand social experiment of kibbutz\nlife. Having helped her mother raise her siblings in Warsaw, and with a natural\naffinity from children, she became the main authority on issues related to\nchildbirth and early childcare. She actively partook in the kibbutz’s planning\nand politics, and reveled in its social life. My father was more detached both\npolitically and socially. He was more contemplative, less assertive, less self-\nconfident. Though he agreed broadly with the founding principles of the\nkibbutz, and wanted to play his role in making it a success, I could see, as I\ngrew older, that he was often impatient at what he saw as its intellectual\ninsularity and its ideological rigidities.\n\nThough it didn’t strike me at the time, he was not a large man. As a result of\nhis childhood illness, he never grew to more than five-foot-four. Still, he was a\npowerful presence, stocky and strong from his work on the kibbutz. He had a\ndeep, resonant voice and wise-looking, blue-gray eyes. It was only through\nUncle Meir that by the time I was born, he had moved on from driving a tractor\nto a more influential role on the kibbutz. Meir worked for the Palestine Electric\nCompany and when Mishmar Hasharon installed its own electricity system, the\nPEC was in charge of the work. Meir trained my father and put him forward as\nthe kibbutz contact for maintaining and repairing the equipment. He was well\nsuited for the work. He was a natural tinkerer, a problem-solver. He was good\nwith his hands, and his natural caution was an additional asset as the kibbutz got\nto grips with the potential, and the potential dangers, of electric power. Once the\nsystem was installed, he became responsible for managing any aspect of the\nsettlement that involved electricity: water pumps, the irrigation system, the\ncommunal laundry and our bakery.\n\nMy parents were courteous and polite with each other, but they never\nshowed any physical affection in our presence. None of the adults did. This was\npart of an unspoken kibbutz code. Not only for kibbutzniks, but for all the early\nZionists, outward displays of emotion were seen as a kind of selfishness that\nrisked undermining communal cohesion, tenacity and strength. Because I’d\nknown no other way, this did not strike me as odd. Besides, I was a quiet,\ncontemplative, bookish and self-contained child. Only in later years did I come to\nsee the lasting effect on me. It was be a long time before I became comfortable\n\n23\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011494\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Hunter 46\nThese gains are an extraordinary achievement for District 31\n\na school and its district. They are also difficult to\n\nmaintain over time, however this goal is shared Fifth Grade\n\nbetween the District and k12. The Hunter School\n\naccomplished these gains through the staff's hard Hunter 22\n\nwork, commitment to their students and —\n\ndedication to implementing the k12 program. District 15\n\nNew programs often take two to three years to generate similar results. While k12 and the Hunter staff\nare pleased with the first year’s results, it is only the beginning of a longer effort because, despite the\ngains, more than half of last year’s fifth graders still did not score at or above their grade level. Therefore,\nalthough there is pride in the progress, the overall scores demonstrate how much more is to be done.\n\n13.5. Direct to Consumer (3% of 2006E Revenue)\n\nk12 sells its curriculum direct to consumers who either home school their children or use k12’s curriculum\nto supplement their child’s education. k12 believes that it offers children and their parents an education\ncomparable to that offered in the nation’s best public and private schools, utilizing optimal multimedia\nmethods and research-tested approaches to learning. In addition, integrated assessments allow a parent\nto test his or her child’s mastery of skills and enables the child to progress at the appropriate pace.\nChildren can move faster through lessons and address more challenging problems, while other children\ncan spend the additional time needed to master certain skills. With k12’s high standards and integrated\nassessments, a parent can be confident that his or her child has mastered the subject. k12 considers this\nmarket a growth area.\n\nEducating a child at home full time or part time is a time-consuming and daunting task for parents.\nParents and caregivers spend a considerable amount of time searching for curriculum and trying to\nensure they are teaching the material adequately to their children. k12 offers a solution to this challenge\nby offering a comprehensive curriculum for students in grades K-9, complete with specific daily lessons.\nParents can purchase individual or multiple courses. Although small, the home-schooling market is\ngrowing at a healthy pace. Approximately 1.1 million students—roughly 2% of total K-12 enrollment—\nwere home-schooled in spring 2003, according to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).\nThis represents a roughly 30% increase from spring 1999. Most home school parents cited concerns\nabout the school environment (31%), interest in providing religious instruction (30%) and_ overall\ndissatisfaction with academic instruction (16%) as their reasons for home schooling their children.*°\n\nThe exam is also used in assessing performance toward No Child Left Behind guidelines for grades 3, 5, 9 and 11. The goal of the exam is for\nstudents to score at or above proficient levels. Student results are also used fo determine a school and district's performance in meeting pre-\ndetermined goals known as Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP).\n\n°° Source: Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005.\n\n110\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024543\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Marie Villafafia was the lead federal prosecutor in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case. The U.S. attorney’s office’s handling of\n\nthe prosecution, which led to a plea to minor charges in state court, has been harshly criticized.\n\nLater that year, Acosta and Villafafa put together a plea bargain for Epstein, a\nmultimillionaire money manager who sexually abused nearly three dozen teenage\ngirls at his mansion in Palm Beach. The deal, a federal judge ruled last month, was\nintentionally kept from his victims in violation of the Crime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nWhile the two cases are unrelated, it shows that both Acosta and Villafana had been\nwarned about the importance of victim disclosure in sex crimes cases before the\nEpstein agreement. They nevertheless forged ahead with a pact with Epstein that\nviolated the law.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Kenneth A. Marra wrote: “When the Government gives\ninformation to victims, it cannot be misleading. While the Government spent untold\nhours negotiating the terms and implications of the [agreement] with Epstein’s\nattorneys, scant information was shared with victims.”\n\nThis comes as Acosta, who is now the U.S. secretary of labor, is facing mounting\nscrutiny for his oversight of the Epstein case. On Monday, White House press\nsecretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to say whether President Trump has full\nconfidence in Acosta, noting that Acosta’s involvement in the Epstein case is\n“currently under review.”\n\nThe Justice Department launched a probe in January into whether Acosta, Villafafia\nand other prosecutors committed professional misconduct.\n\nFrancey Hakes, who worked in the Justice Department’s Crimes Against Children\nunit, said Zloch’s comments were so brutal that it should have deterred Acosta and\nVillafafia from keeping the deal secret.\n\n“Tt is highly unusual for a court to allege an assistant U.S. attorney has intentionally\nwithheld information.

Ultimately we are drawn to the question of whether\nthe wars were won by one side or another, or whether it’s more accurate to say that they simply\nfaded away.

WTC Attack — 9/11 (2001)\n3. BENGHAZI Attack — 9/11 (2012)\nBut you have to remember that H. W. Bush was planted:\n\nAUTHOR PETER DALE SCOTT: Sometimes you have little deep events that most people don't even\nnotice. One of those would be the Halloween Massacre. The older people remember the Saturday\nNight Massacre which happened under Nixon. I'm talking about the Halloween Massacre of October\n31, 1975, and probably people watching this show have never heard of it.\n\nThat was under Ford, and Ford may have condoned it because it was trying to help restore his\npopularity. He was going way down in the polls. But it was a very important series of events all on the\nsame night. The head of the CIA was fired, William Colby, replaced by a relatively unknown man\ncalled George H. W. Bush who then went on to authorize something that Colby had refused to\nauthorize - the Team B report - the Team B to recalculate the Soviet threat and it was pre-\ndetermined. They were going to find that it was much bigger than the professionals angled like\nRaymond [inaudible] that | mentioned.\n\nThey said Russia is less of a threat now than it used to be. Well, that was terrible news for the\nindustrial complex so the Team B came in and said oh, no, no, no, it's much more of a threat than it\nused to be, and that's why we got this huge military build-up. It started actually under Carter but we\nthink of it as the Reagan build-up, and that of course is a major factor in having ended the Soviet\nUnion because the Soviet Union tried to match it with a weaker economy. And that arms race which\nwas not about threats but was about fighting economic war, that was an arms race which you could\nsay that the Soviet Union lost because they couldn't keep it up. Their economy went more and more\ndownhill because they were deflecting resources away from vital domestic functions. But really I'm\ntrying to talk here about the Halloween Massacre...\n\nJust the change in the CIA was a major historical event but it wasn't very visible. The second thing\nthat happened was they fired Jim Schlesinger as Secretary of Defense... It was being done by\n[President Ford's] Chief of Staff and his assistant who are two names barely known then but quite\nfamous since. Chief of staff was Donald Rumsfeld and the assistant was Dick Cheney. And that was\nthe first real intrusion of the Rumsfeld-Cheney team into American politics. And they became the real\nheart of what | consider the Deep State in the 1980s when they were planning for Continuity of\nGovernment which was a plan for emergency rules like warrantless surveillance and warrantless\ndetention and the militarization of homeland security. All those things were planned all through the\n‘80s - COG planning by Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney. Even when Rumsfeld wasn't in the\ngovernment, he was authorized by Reagan to do this planning.\n\nAnd why is that important to our history? Because in 2001, these two men were now in the\ngovernment - Vice President and Secretary of Defense - the two top people in Washington on\nSeptember the 11th, 2001 when Bush was down in Florida - George W. Bush - and what did they do\non that day? They implemented the plans they had been planning for 20 years. Another major event\nin American history but it's not usually told that way.\n\nWe implemented - it’s in the 9/11 Commission Report that COG plans were implemented on that day.\nThis is a huge change in our country. We now have an ARMY command, NORTHCOM, to take\ncharge of America - North America, the way SOUTHCOM is in charge of South America and\nCENTCOM is in charge of Central Asia.\n\nThis used to be illegal...

I managed to get his statement\nback to the United States. Shortly thereafter he was released and came to live in my home while\nhe was trying to get into school here.\n\nMy interest in Soviet Jewry was stimulated by Elie Wiesel’s wonderful book Zhe Jews of Silence.\nBut it became a passion only after a more personal encounter. In 1971, I was invited to become a\nfellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences on the Stanford campus in\nPalo Alto, California. Forty fellows were invited from all over the world, to spend the year\nwriting and thinking. This year for the first time, a fellow had been invited from Communist\nRomania, Michael Cernea. He was Chairman of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology\nat the University of Bucharest and an active member of the Romanian Communist Party. On the\nday before Rosh Hashanah, he invited me to take a walk with him through the woods. When we\nwere away from any possibility of surveillance he told me that his real name was Moishe Katz,\nthat he was a committed Jew, and that he desperately wanted to defect along with his family from\nCommunist Romania and move either to the United States or Israel. He swore me to secrecy and\nasked if I would become his pro-bono lawyer in what would surely be a long-term activity, since\nhis family was being held hostage back in Romania. I immediately agreed and invited him to my\nhome for dinner that night, where we stayed up until dawn, listening to Jewish cantorial music,\nwhich he had not heard since his youth some thirty years earlier. Tears flowed freely from his\neyes. Several years later, we were able to arrange for him and his wife to be out of the country at\nthe same time, and they both defected, leaving his two children and his elderly mother behind.\nBut within a year or so, with the help of Senator Kennedy and others, we managed to get the\nwhole family out. We have remained close friends since that time.\n\nAnother close friend who started out as a client is Natan Sharansky, now a cabinet member of the\nIsraeli government. When I represented him his name was Anatoly Sharansky and he was an\nimprisoned Soviet refusenick. His mother and wife asked me, along with my friend and colleague\nIrwin Cotler, now the Minister of Justice in Canada, to represent Anatoly on a pro-bono basis.\nWe continued to be his lawyer for nearly nine years. We were not allowed to meet our client or\neven to communicate with him. For all we knew, he had no idea we were his lawyers. But we\nrepresented him vigorously in the court of public opinion as well as in the courts of the Soviet\nUnion. We were also involved in proposed prisoner exchanges which included Sharansky, Nelson\nMandela and several Eastern European spies being held by the United States. Neither Sharansky\nnor Mandela wanted to be part of any exchange for real spies, since they were political dissidents.\nIt is interesting to note, a especially in light of Sharansky’s high position in the Israeli government,\nthat when Sharansky was first arrested, the Israeli government wanted to have nothing to do with\nhis case, since they regarded him as a human rights dissident rather than as a prisoner of Zion. He\nwas, of course, both. When he was finally released some of the very same people who fought\nhardest against Israel doing anything on his behalf were among the first to claim credit for his\nrelease.\n\nI will never forget how I watched my client walk - - really bounce - - across the Glinicke Bridge\nand into the safety of the West. I knew he was well even while watching him on television.\n\nShortly thereafter I met him in person for the first time. He threw his arms around me and\nwhispered in my ear, “Baruch matir asurim,” which means, “Blessed be those who help free the\n\n325\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017412\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

To\nthis day, I doubt that Woody Allen knows how Robert Morvillo tried to use his case to settle a\nscore with me.\n\nShortly after it was publicly announced that I would be helping to defend Mia Farro against the\nlawsuit brought by Woody Allen, my phone rang.

What can I do to help?”\n\nI told Mr. Sinatra that I appreciated the call but that the legal case was under control.\n\nHe quickly responded, “Well beyond the legal case, what can I do to call Woody off?”\n\nAware of Sinatra’s reputation as a tough guy, I nervously told him to leave it to the lawyers and\nthat any approach to Woody Allen would be used against Mia and would backfire.\n\nSeveral months later, during the summer, Andre Previn—another of Mia’s former husbands—was\nperforming in the Whaling Church on Martha’s Vineyard. My wife and I attended his concert and\nthen went to a reception that followed. Previn, like Sinatra, told me how much he loved Mia and\n\nthat she was a great person.\n\nHe continued, “I feel like marching up to his apartment, knocking on the door, and punching him\nin the face, telling him to leave Mia alone.”\n\nRecalling the Sinatra call, I let out an uncontrollable laugh.

The goal is to simulate the\nphysical human form, its movements and mannerisms. It’s easy to get\nclose, but close is not good enough. The term “Uncanny Valley’ has been\ncoined to describe the discomfort humans have with something that tries\nto simulate a human being but does not quite get there. I think it is part\nof the reason Madam Tussaud’s waxworks are so fascinating. Humans\nhave a love-hate relationship with facsimiles of themselves. They love\nthe flattery but feel a sense of revulsion at anything that comes too close.\n\nSearle and Turing\n\nIn the Turing Test, we limited our senses to the purely symbolic: using\nonly typed words on a screen. I could break the lock on the door and go\ninto the room to see what was there.\n\n“Aha!” I would say.\n\n“I can see you're a computer, I, therefore, know you'll be good at\nsums and bad at creativity”\n\nBut Turing wants us to see if the difference is given away purely\nthrough intellect. He argues there is no way to tell. But if you follow my\nargument from chapter 1, there is one way: ask the computer to find a\nnon-computable solution to a mathematical puzzle. This is, in practice,\na difficult test to pose because it might take a very long time. Twenty-\nfive billion people have lived on planet Earth during the last 350 years,\nand about 5 million of them were mathematicians. None of them was\nable to solve the problem posed by Pierre de Fermat until Andrew Wiles\nturned up but this is a clear difference between humans and computers.\nHowever long you give a computer it would never be able to solve the\nproblem.\n\nThis creativity test would take centuries to run if non-computable\nthought was rare, but I think we see it often — on display even when we\ntell jokes. In which case computers and humans should be easy to tell\napart: humans are the funny ones. I am not saying you can't build a brain;\nour brains are physical devices, after all. I just believe a computer or a\nmechanistic machine, cannot think like a human being.\n\nI like the Searle argument but qualitative arguments are insufficient.\nWe need a quantitative argument. In the forthcoming chapters, I am\ngoing to look at the mathematical argument underlying the difference\nbetween human intelligence and computer processing. Before we do this\nlet’s take one last look at a qualitative difference; the way computers and\nhumans communicate.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015765\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Some were operational. It is true we ended up overcoming Palestinian\nand Syrian resistance. Given the numerical balance of forces, that was a\nforegone conclusion. But with all the attention paid to the political aims of the\ninvasion, we’d never sufficiently planned for operating against a wholly\ndifferent kind of enemy than in our previous wars, and on a wholly different\nkind of terrain. Huge columns of Israeli armor had found themselves stuck on\nthe winding roads of central Lebanon, running low on gasoline, vulnerable to\nrelatively small ambush squads. In some instances, a dozen Palestinian fighters\nor Syrian commandos had halted the best-armed, best-trained, tank forces in the\nMiddle East for hours on end. Overall, the pattern of past wars had been broken.\nEven in 1973, once the surprise attacks had been turned back, Israeli forces had\nadvanced, attacked and broken enemy resistance. That hadn’t happened here.\n\nThere was a deeper problem as well. At the start of the conflict, Begin had\ndeclared, boastfully almost, that this was Israel’s first “war of choice.” That\nwasn’t true. Both 1956 and 1967 were wars of choice. Yet those preemptive\nattacks, especially in the Six-Day War, were in response to a sense of strategic\nthreat that was commonly understood by almost all Israelis. There was a sense\nnot just of consensus, but national unity. This war was different. It had been\nlaunched in pursuit of a specific political vision: a marriage of Begin’s political\ncredo and Arik’s determination to use overwhelming force to bulldoze a new\npolitical reality in Lebanon.\n\nThe findings of the inquiry commission were published in February 1983.\nThey were all the more powerful for the forensic language used. The inquiry did\nconcede Begin’s point: it was Gemayel’s men who had actually done the\nkilling. But it said that the Israel1 commanders’ decision to allow the\nPhalangists into the refugee camps “was taken without consideration of the\ndanger — which the makers and executors of the decision were obligated to\nforesee as probable — that the Phalangists would commit massacres.” The\ncommission added that “when the reports began to arrive about the actions of\nthe Phalangists in the camps, no proper heed was taken. The correct conclusions\nwere not drawn. No energetic and immediate action was taken to restrain the\nPhalangists and put a stop to their actions.”\n\nArik bore personal responsibility for this, the report said. So did Raful, and\nthe head of military intelligence, Yehoshua Saguy.

It was charged with monitoring\nnuclear proliferation in Iran, Pakistan, and North Korea, poten-\ntial jihadist threats everywhere in the world, and much else. The\nRussian foreign intelligence service, the SVR, could put its limited\nresources to work on redressing the gap with its main enemy: the\nUnited States.\n\nNevertheless, Putin had to reckon with the reality in 2013 that\nRussia could not compete with the NSA in the business of inter-\ncepting communications. And if the NSA could listen in on all the\ninternal activities of its spy agencies and security regime, the ability\nof Putin to use covert means to achieve his other global ambitions\nwould be impaired. In the cold peace that replaced the Cold War,\nRussia had little hope of realizing these ambitions unless it could\nweaken the NSA’‘s iron-tight grip on global communications intel-\nligence. One way to remedy the imbalance between Russian intel-\nligence and the NSA was via espionage. Here the SVR would be the\ninstrument, and the immediate objective would be to acquire the\nNSA’s lists of its sources in Russia. If successful, it would be a game\n\n© changer. ®\n\nSuch an ambitious penetration of the NSA, to be sure, was a tall\norder for Russian intelligence. Most of its moles recruited in the\nNSA by the KGB had been code clerks, guards, translators, and low-\nlevel analysts. They provided documents about the NSA‘s cipher\nbreaking, but they lacked access to the lists of the NSA’s sources and\nmethods. These meager results did not inhibit Russian efforts. For\nsix decades, ever since the inception of the NSA in 1952, the Russian\nintelligence service had engaged in a covert war with the NSA.\n\nThe Russian intelligence service is, as far as is known, the only\nintelligence service in the world that ever succeeded in penetrating\nthe NSA. A number of NSA employees also defected to Moscow.\nThe history of this venerable enterprise is instructive.\n\nThe first two defectors in the NSA’s history were William Mar-\ntin and Bernon Mitchell. They were mathematicians working on the\nNSA’s decryption machines who went to Moscow via Cuba in 1960.\nThe Russian intelligence service, then called the KGB, went to great\nlengths to get propaganda value from their defections. It even orga-\nnized a ninety-minute press conference for them on September 6,\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r.indd 222 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019710\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The Hong Kong authorities had been advised as early as\nJune 19, 2013 that there were criminal charges against Snowden and only a typographical error in\nspelling out Snowden’s middle name—James instead of John-- in the criminal charges prevented\nthe Hong Kong police from immediately ordering his detention. His Hong Kong lawyers were\nadvised of the pending charges, which were unsealed on June 21, 2013 and published on front\npage of the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong. So presumably Snowden knew that action\nby the U.S. government was imminent. One of his lawyers, Jonathan Mann, even accompanied\nSnowden to the airport out of his concern that he would not even be allowed by Hong Kong\nauthorities to go through passport control. Although Snowden still had a US passport in his\npossession, the computerized database would show on June 23rd, it was no longer valid for travel\nto anywhere but the U.S.\n\nThis electronic notification advised foreign government that his passport was only approved for\nhis return to the U.S. Even so, when he arrived in Russia any future international travel decisions\nfor him would be up to Russia, not the U.S. So the only government with the means to “trap”\nhim in Russia was the Russian government.\n\nThe U.S. government also knew that his it was no accident that Snowden wound up in the\nhands of Russia. He had been in contact with Russian officials in Hong Kong. Even before Putin\nadmitted this liaison on September 3, 2013, the CIA knew about it. In fact, on June 23™, t,\nSenator Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), correctly said based on a White House briefing that\n“Vladimir Putin had personally approved Snowden’s flight” to Moscow. As mentioned earlier,\nthe NSA still had the capability to monitor Russian communication in June 2013. The messages,\nas well as the traffic, it intercepted from its sources reportedly revealed the Russian intelligence\nactivity in Hong Kong. The NSA also reportedly intercepted contacts between these Russian\nofficials and Russian representatives of Aeroflot, the Russian state-owned airline flying between\nHong Kong and Moscow. Aeroflot, like most other international carriers, ordinarily requires\ninternational passengers to have both a valid passport and visa to the country of his destination.\nThat those rules were waived for Snowden implicated Aeroflot in Snowden’s exfiltration from\nHong Kong. All of which meant to investigators that Snowden’s defection to Moscow was not a\nhaphazard result of unexpected circumstances. This raised new questions for the investigation.\nWhat led Snowden to defect to Russia? Was his arrival in Moscow planned by Russia intelligence\nin advance? Was any other party, such as China, privy to the plan? Was there a quid pro quo?\n\nUS intelligence had some clues suggesting that Snowden’s path to Russia had been prepared\nfor him in advance. On September 3, 2013, Russia’s President Putin gave a lengthy interview on\nstate-owned Channel | television in which he divulged that he personally had had advance\nknowledge of Snowden’s plan. “I will tell you something I have never said before,” Putin said.\nSnowden \"first went to Hong Kong and got in touch with our diplomatic representatives” and\nthat he was told then that an American \"agent of special services\" was seeking to come to Russia.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020191\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Don’t be in a rush to jump into a full-time long-term commitment. Take time to find\nsomething that calls to you, not just the first acceptable form of surrogate work.

An out-of-\ncontrol arms race in lethal autonomous weapons that drives the price of automated\nanonymous assassination toward zero will be very hard to stop once it gains momentum.\nThe second goal would require reversing the current trend in some Western countries\nwhere sectors of the population are getting poorer in absolute terms, fueling anger,\nresentment, and polarization. Unless the third goal can be met, all the wonderful AI\ntechnology we create might harm us, either accidentally or deliberately.\n\nAI safety research must be carried out with a strict deadline in mind: Before AGI\narrives, we need to figure out how to make AI understand, adopt, and retain our goals.\nThe more intelligent and powerful machines get, the more important it becomes to align\ntheir goals with ours. As long as we build relatively dumb machines, the question isn’t\nwhether human goals will prevail but merely how much trouble the machines can cause\nbefore we solve the goal-alignment problem. If a superintelligence 1s ever unleashed,\nhowever, it will be the other way around: Since intelligence is the ability to accomplish\ngoals, a superintelligent AI is by definition much better at accomplishing its goals than\nwe humans are at accomplishing ours, and will therefore prevail.\n\nIn other words, the real risk with AGI isn’t malice but competence. A\nsuperintelligent AGI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals\naren’t aligned with ours, we’re in trouble. People don’t think twice about flooding\nanthills to build hydroelectric dams, so let’s not place humanity in the position of those\nants. Most researchers argue that if we end up creating superintelligence, we should\nmake sure it’s what Al-safety pioneer Eliezer Yudkowsky has termed “friendly AI’—AI\nwhose goals are in some deep sense beneficial.\n\nThe moral question of what these goals should be is just as urgent as the technical\nquestions about goal alignment. For example, what sort of society are we hoping to\ncreate, where we find meaning and purpose in our lives even though we, strictly\nspeaking, aren’t needed? I’m often given the following glib response to this\nquestion: “Let’s build machines that are smarter than us and then let them figure out the\nanswer!” This mistakenly equates intelligence with morality. Intelligence isn’t good or\nevil but morally neutral. It’s simply an ability to accomplish complex goals, good or bad.\nWe can’t conclude that things would have been better if Hitler had been more intelligent.\nIndeed, postponing work on ethical issues until after goal-aligned AGI is built would be\nirresponsible and potentially disastrous. A perfectly obedient superintelligence whose\ngoals automatically align with those of its human owner would be like Nazi SS-\nObersturmbannfithrer Adolf Eichmann on steroids. Lacking moral compass or\ninhibitions of its own, it would, with ruthless efficiency, implement its owner’s goals,\nwhatever they might be.!?\n\nWhen I speak of the need to analyze technology risk, ’m sometimes accused of\nscaremongering.

Objective: an alliance between \nright-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections \nNEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru who \nwas Donald Trump's right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following the racist \nviolence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the Daily Beast \nhimself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (II Movimento), right in the heart of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019312 \nEurope and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the \nEuropean elections which will be held in spring 2019. \nObjective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor of \nthe Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in support of \nNGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist right, accused \nof plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to have \nlabour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the Interior \nMatteo Salvini. \nThe ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in the \nEuropean campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and \nRome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great \"populist international\" of which he \nhas long since been dreaming. \nThe Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic \nadvice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European \nmovements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling \nfunding. \nThe aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of \"super group\" that if victorious can conquer up to a \nthird of the European Parliament in the elections next May. \nIndeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The \nAmerican strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress \n— and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data stolen \nfrom Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump emerged victor. \nIt is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West. And he has \nalready met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and the former leader of \nthe British separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on Friday in Pennsylvania, \nUSA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. Without forgetting the \nItalians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: \"If it works in Italy, we can import the model \nanywhere\". \nThe Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. In \nshort, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries \nsupporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But in \nthe future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also because \nthe relationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff and \npublished in the scandal book \"Fire and Fury\". \"Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Paradise,\" \nBannon says now paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost Paradise. \nHell in this case would be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The \"army of darkness\" is \nalready among us. \nIn Sacratissimo Corde Iesu et Purissimo Corde Mariae et Castissimo Corde Ioseph. \n******* \nBenjamin Harnwell \nFounder and President of the Board of Trustees \nDignitatis Humanae Institute \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019313 \nCell: \nOfficl \n- \nIstituto Dignitatis Humanae \n44 Via delle Fornaci  \nRoma 00165  \nITALY  \n@ben harnwell \n_ \nwww.dignitatishumanae.corn \nII giorno 22 lug 2018, alle ore 15:38, Steve Bannon <I> ha scritto: \nWhat does this say??? \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: Maria Luisa \nW \nDate: July 22, 2018 at 9:11:58 AM EDT \nTo: Steve Bannon <11111>, Preate Alexandra <41.1 \n<PHOTO-2018-07-22-10-02-17.jpg> \nSent from my iPhone \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

Victims never got that opportunity when Epstein faced criminal charges, because \nAlex Acosta___then the lead prosecutor, now the Secretary of Labor___let Epstein off with \na ridiculously lenient sentence. Despite having committed hideous sex offenses with dozens \nof minors, Epstein received a sentence of 13 months in jail, during which he was often free \nduring the day. \nEpstein's decision to buy his out of the civil lawsuit, one that he had the nerve to initiate, \nbenefits Acosta. The trial would have provided non-stop headlines, coupled with frequent \nreferences to the sweetheart deal Acosta gave him. As Randy Schultz puts it, the trial would \nhave been the occasion for a long overdue public shaming of Acosta. Now, he avoids this \nconsequence. \nBut this doesn't mean Acosta is out of the woods. He faces calls for his ouster from the \nTrump cabinet. \nSome calls are from the usual suspects. Michelle Goldberg of the New York Times has \nwritten a piece so obnoxious that it almost makes me want to see Acosta ride out the storm. \nBut some conservatives are also advocating Acosta's departure. Concerned Women for \nAmerica is a stalwart conservative organization. It describes itself, accurately, as \"focus[ed] \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030958 \non seven core issues: the family, the sanctity of human life, religious liberty, education, \nsexual exploitation, national sovereignty, and support for Israel.\" (Emphasis added) \nIts leader, Penny Nance, has called for Acosta's resignation. Noting that labor trafficking, \nwhich the Labor Department combats, is often conjoined with sex trafficking, Nance says \nthat President Trump would not have nominated Acosta if reports fully describing Acosta's \nconduct in the Epstein case had emerged earlier. \nSen. Ben Sasse has also weighed in. He sent a letter to the Justice Department asking it to \ninvestigate its treatment of Epstein, including the fact that the plea deal ensured that victims \nof the pervert would be denied the ability to comment on or object to the leniency of his \nsentence. Sasse is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Oversight, \nAgency Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts. \nSen. Marco Rubio, a longtime supporter of Acosta, says it would be \"very troubling\" if \npolitical influence led to a light sentence for Epstein. In Rubio's view, and that of every \nrational person, Epstein \"should have been in jail for a long time.\" Rubio added, however, \nthat he will reserve judgment until he hears Acosta's side. \nThat's fair. But so far, Acosta has provided no real defense for letting Epstein off so lightly. \nIn public, at least, he is standing by his argument that the deal was a reasonable one and that \nthis is old news. \nPreviously, Acosta had a different defense. He cited \"a year-long assault on the prosecution \nand the prosecutors\" by \"an army of legal superstars\" who represented Epstein. This \nallegedly included \"defense counsel investigat[ing] individual prosecutors and their \nfamilies, looking for personal peccadilloes that may provide a basis for disqualification.\" In \nthis account, the deal was made to relieve the pressure, while still getting a conviction. \nAcosta could hardly assert this explanation____i.e., that he wimped out___while seeking a \ncabinet position with the expectation of being appointed to more exalted jobs in the future. \nNor is the explanation particularly plausible. Acosta isn't the first prosecutor to face a \nscorched earth defense. Ask Ken Starr about this. \nI don't doubt that Acosta regarded escaping the wrath of the defense team as a benefit of \nreaching the plea deal. But I don't believe this was incentive enough to cause him, in effect, \nto throw the case. \nWhat was the true incentive? As I wrote when this story broke, I think it was the same \nincentive that explains much of his conduct in public life___Acosta's desire to \naccommodate people he thinks can help him down the road. \nWhich people? Probably the lawyers at Kirkland and Ellis, where Acosta had once worked. \nEpstein enlisted Ken Starr* and Jay Lefkowitz, both of Kirkland, for his defense team. \nAcosta reportedly worked out the terms of his surrender with Lefkowitz, a former \ncolleague, at a meeting in a location far away from the prosecutor's office. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030959 \nThe location of the meeting is itself suspicious. Prosecutors and other law enforcement \nofficials normally demand that those seeking a deal come to them. \nThe fact that Acosta didn't is another sign___if one were needed___that this was a \ncapitulation. It also casts further doubt on the claim that Acosta was capitulating for the \npurpose of sparing the folks who worked with him in the prosecutor's office. \nThe key point, though, is that Ken Starr and Jay Lefkowitz were power players in \nWashington___men who might help Acosta down the road. \nReaders will be quite familiar with Starr's background. Lefkowitz was director of cabinet \naffairs and deputy executive secretary to the domestic policy council under President \nGeorge H.W. Bush. Under President George W. Bush, Lefkowitz served as general counsel \nin the Office of Management and Budget and later as deputy director of domestic policy at \nthe White House. \nAccommodating such influential figures must have seemed like a good career move. \nHaving Starr and Lefkowitz on his side might help Acosta get a judgeship, a cabinet \nappointment, or a high-paying job back at Kirkland and Ellis. \nI'm speculating, of course. But my speculation finds support in Acosta's practice of \naccommodating the powerful. \nMuch of that accommodation is of Democrats. Indeed, at the time Acosta was working in \nMiami as a U.S. Attorney, he had alienated some Republicans by such accommodation  \nwhile at the Department of Justice. Some say he was on the verge of being fired when \nAttorney General Alberto Gonzalez parachuted him to Miami. The Epstein settlement was a \nway for Acosta to shore up his standing with some influential Republicans. \nWill Acosta be able to survive the current scandal? I don't have a clear sense about this yet. \nBut President Trump, who isn't bashful about sacking cabinet members, may come to \nbelieve (if he doesn't now) that it's disadvantageous to have a cabinet member who sold out \nteenage victims of sexual abuse, especially when the sell-out benefited an ultra-wealthy \nserial offender. \n* Some on the left are trying to make something or the fact that Starr, who had investigated \nBill Clinton in connection with sexual misconduct, later defended Epstein, a pervert. This is \nsilly. \nIn both instances, Starr was doing his job as a lawyer. Perverts are entitled to a defense and \nthere is nothing hypocritical about investigating Bill Clinton's misconduct when that was \nStarr's job and later joining the team that was defending Jeffrey Epstein. \nAcosta, by contrast, was on the team seeking justice for Epstein and for his victims. He \ngave up this quest for reasons that can't be defended. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030960 \nSent from my iPad \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

This is the most effective way to solve a creative programming\ntask. Practically, once your task is over the limit for a single human, a\nsoftware project must be split up. This requires great care. Dividing a\nproblem efficiently means specifying the interfaces between them and\ndecoupling the components. This is the art of an architect or a producer\nin the creative arts. The creative process operates similarly in other walks\nof life. There are many examples of successful creative duos — Rogers\nand Hammerstein (The Sound of Music), Ben Elton and Richard Curtis\n(Blackadder).\n\nGood managers, therefore, find ways to break projects into\nmanageable sub-projects that can be worked by pairs or rely on single\nsuper-programmers with support around them. If you are lucky enough\nto gather together a group of super-programmers and can divide a\nproblem efficiently amongst them, you can achieve great things. You\nsee this pipeline in movie production. A script writer generates a script\ncreatively. The casting director finds the actors, a director is in charge of\nfilming, and an editor puts it together. In very great movies you will often\nfind a great director or producer who had a hand in almost everything\nholding it all together. They are often accused of micro-managing but\nyou can see that’s what they must do. They are the super-programmer\nwith the whole creative work in their head, and an eye on the audience\nand financial backers.\n\nIf you talk with great programmers you will be amazed by their\nbreadth of technical, commercial and product knowledge. Why do they\nneed all this commercial information to do their job in the round?\n\nRules and Tips\n\nI began writing some rules on how to split up a project, and almost\nimmediately ran into exceptions and special cases. The job of dividing\nthings into sub-tasks is, itself, a creative problem and must not be done\nmechanically. Any ‘one size fits all’ rule will fail and you must apply\ndomain knowledge and careful thought to the process.\n\nIt is the job of architects or a senior engineer to split projects into\nsmaller chunks. To do this they must accurately ‘guess’ boundaries\nbetween subtasks to create self-contained, creatively solvable problems.\nThis can be done by either vertical or horizontal abstraction. Both have\ntheir problems.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015956\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

In that case, a series of errors resulted in the loss of three transmission lines in Ohio over the course of about an\nhour. Once the third line went down, the outage cascaded towards the coast, cutting power to some 50 million people.\nHavlin says that this outage is an example of the inherent instability his study describes, but others question whether the\nteam’s conclusions can really be extrapolated to the real world.\n\n“| suppose | should be open-minded to new research, but I'm not convinced,” says Jeff Dagle, an electrical engineer at the\nPacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington, who served on the government task force that investigated\nthe 2003 outage. “The problem is that this doesn’t reflect the physics of how the power grid operates.”\n\nCritical order\n\nHavlin and his colleagues focused on idealized scenarios. They found that randomly structured networks — such as social\nnetworks — degrade slowly as nodes are removed, which in the real world might mean there is time to diagnose and\naddress a problem before a system collapses. By contrast, the connections of orderly lattice structures have more critical\nnodes, which increase the instability. The problem is that such orderly networks are always operating near an indefinable\nedge, Havlin says. To reduce that risk, he recommends adding a small number of longer transmission lines that provide\nshort cuts to different parts of the grid.\n\nBenjamin Carreras, a physicist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee who has conducted similar work2, says that\nnetwork theory can be useful for providing insight into electric grids but must be complemented with more complex models\nthat attempt to represent both the physical realities and the responsiveness of the modern electric grid. Although in some\ncases adding long lines can benefit the overall stability of an electric system, Carreras’ work suggests that in certain\ncircumstances such an approach allows problems to propagate even farther.\n\n“More connections may stabilize some processes, by, for instance, increasing the number of paths to generators, but also\nmay destabilize others,” Carreras says. “One cannot make generic statements on this topic.”\n\nAlthough local outages caused by falling trees knocking down distribution lines are common, large-scale failures within the\ncore ne transmission lines rarely occur ona modern electric grid. Before 2003, the last major blackout in the United States\nhad been on the west coast in 1996, and more recently an outage has struck in the San Diego area.\n\nDagle says that the 2003 blackout stemmed from a combination of bad vegetation management — the first three lines\ntripped after sagging into trees but were all within their load rating — and a series of monitoring and communications\nbreakdowns. Vegetation requirements have since been standardized, and a new generation of sensors is providing grid\noperators with more information about what is happening across the grid at any given moment.\n\n“Many more utilities have much more data,” Dagle says. “The next phase of our voyage is to make better use of that data.”\nBack to top\nTechnology — Full text articles\n\nBallmer Departure From Microsoft Was More Sudden Than Portrayed by the Company\nKara Swisher — All Things D\n\nAccording to sources close to the situation, the departure of CEO Steve Ballmer from Microsoft last week was more sudden\nthan was depicted by the company in its announcement that he would be retiring within the next year in a planned smooth\ntransition.\n\nIt was neither planned nor as smooth as portrayed.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028628\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

To return the favor, Matthews\nallegedly bought a condo in Washington, D.C., from Rowland through a straw buyer\nin 1997 for nearly 20 percent more than what the governor had originally paid.\n\nThe condo sale and other business dealings eventually led to a corruption\ninvestigation into Rowland.

As Michael\nHartnett pointed out, 2016 saw global interest rates fall to 5,000-year lows and the\nlikely end of what has been the greatest bull market in bonds ever. We experienced a\nhistoric US Presidential election and Republican sweep of Congress on November 9th.\nLater that same month, OPEC reached a historic deal to reduce crude production by\n1.2mn b/d with non-OPEC producers delivering an additional 600k b/d of cuts – the first\nsuch joint curb since 1998. Risk assets responded with 30-year Treasury reaching a\nyield of 2.088% in July, US equity markets reaching all-time highs, and oil prices rallying\nmore than 40% since the start of the year. Given the Republican sweep - and the\nresulting likelihood that the logjam of Washington gridlock will be broken - our Top 10\nstock selections are more heavily geared toward companies that may benefit from\nincreased fiscal stimulus, a more pro-business agenda, and/or tax-policy reform.

The list\nreflects primarily a bottoms-up approach, with calendar-specific events noted for most\nstocks. We constructed our list by canvassing BofAML Fundamental Equity Research\nanalysts in order to find 10 BofAML-covered stocks which we think will significantly\noutperform or underperform peers during the quarter. We considered only Buy-rated\nnames for outperform ideas and Underperform-rated names for underperform ideas. We\nthen narrowed the list after consulting our Equity Research colleagues.\nTo be eligible for the list, the stock must be covered by BofA Merrill Lynch AMRS\nfundamental equity analysts with a rating of Buy or Underperform, for long and short\nstock recommendations, respectively.\nStocks will be chosen on a discretionary basis by the Alpha Generation team, which\ncurrently includes strategists with experience choosing stocks for BofAML’s US 1 list.\nStocks will be chosen for the list using a bottoms-up approach after taking into account\nthe views of the relevant BofA Merrill Lynch Fundamental Equity analyst and upcoming\ncatalysts. Diversity of the list and BofAML macro views will also be factors in choosing\nstocks for the list.\nStocks on the list will generally remain on the list during the quarter. However, a stock\nwill be removed interim quarter if considered ineligible due to a change in the stock’s\nfundamental rating, or if the stock is no long covered by BofA Merrill Lynch fundamental\nEquity Research. When stocks are removed during the quarter, they will not be replaced.\nStocks will generally be removed from the list at the end of the quarter in conjunction\nwith the publication of the next quarter’s list, but may on select occasions remain on the\nlist if the identified catalyst remains relevant or a new catalyst is expected to drive the\nrequisite over/under performance. Any intra-quarter actions to the list will be announced\nin a research report.\nThe Top 10 list will be published on or close to the first day of each quarter. In addition,\nwe may also publish research reports updating the catalysts’ status or other news on\nparticular stocks during the quarter.\nHow the list will be maintained and updated\nWe will publish this list at the beginning of each quarter. Ideas will generally remain on\nthe list through the quarter unless coverage is dropped or the recommendation changes.\nAny security which is removed will not be replaced. If there are any changes to the list\nduring the quarter we will promptly publish a note explaining the change.

PF 2018 earnings\nshould be close to $11.50 (vs $9.70 consensus), even before taking into account the\nupside from tax reform (+15% to EPS) and rising interest rates (+5%).

While we were not concerned about\nSIVB's ability to transition into a CCAR bank, the removal of this should no doubt serve\nas a positive. At $43bn in assets, becoming a CCAR bank had been weighing on investor\nsentiment. With expectations for this threshold to be pushed higher, this should no\nlonger be a significant concern when thinking about SIVB's growth trajectory. Another\nissue that has not been discussed much but could occur is any changes in the Volcker\nrule that would allow the bank to once again participate in investing capital in PE/VC\nfunds. We view this restriction as an unintended consequence on SIVB stemming from\nthe Volcker rule and the ability once again participate in these funds would be a\nsignificant positive given the potential for getting equity exposure in the early stages of\nthe life cycle of start-up companies.\nTax Policy: With SIVB paying an effective tax rate of 40.6% in 2016 YTD, the bank will\nundoubtedly be a beneficiary from a lower corporate tax rate.

We expect TXN to continue to generate industry leading FCF while growing its\ndividend at 20%+ CAGR. We look toward the strategy update call in early February as\nthe next catalyst for the stock.\nTable 1: Texas Instruments key stock data\nIndustry\nSemiconductors\nMarket Cap (mn) $73,899\nPrice $74.15\nP/E (2017) 20.1x\n% of sell-side rated Buy 35.3%\nShort interest % of float 1.75%\nSource: Bloomberg and BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates\nDeregulation/Gov’t Legislation: 60% of TXN’s sales are exposed to the industrial,\nautomotive, and communications equipment end markets. We think these markets could\nTop 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017 13\nsee the most uplift in spending from any potentially large fiscal stimulus and\ninfrastructure spending under the new US administration.\nTax Policy: Unlike most semis, TXN reports its financials on a pure GAAP basis and its\ntax rate at 30% is one of the highest in the industry. We think TXN stands to\ndisproportionately benefit from the looser tax policies foreshadowed by the upcoming\nadministration. Specifically, a 10% drop in the corporate tax rate would lead to 15%\nhigher EPS for TXN in 2017, all else equal.\nCatalysts: (1) Seasonally stronger period for industrial/automotive spending – 46% of\nTXN’s revenue come from these end markets; (2) Annual strategy and capital allocation\npolicy update call with shareholders which is likely to occur at the beginning of February.\nLatest report: The new \"industrials\": growth recovery plus pricing power,\nBuy TXN, ADI, MCHP, ON\n1Q risks: (1) Still somewhat large (>10%) exposure to consumer electronics could create\nnear-term volatility in topline results; (2) Historically lumpy communications equipment\nspending trends; (3) Larger than expected slowdown in North America automotive unit\nproduction\nCompany Description: Texas Instruments is a broad-based supplier of semiconductor\ncomponents, ranging from digital signal processors, to high-performance analog\ncomponents, to digital light-processing technology and calculators. 65% of TXN sales\nare exposed to the well diversified, business-to-business Industrial, Automotive,\nCommunications Infrastructure, and Enterprise markets.\nTripAdvisor (TRIP)\nNat Schindler +1 415 676 3574\nResearch Analyst, MLPF&S\nUnderperform, PO $41\n1Q investment thesis\nDespite easier y/y comps in 2017, we see risk that Click-based & Transaction Hotel\nrevenue continues to decline as 1) higher monetizing desktop traffic structurally\ndeclines, 2) mobile monetization remains at 30% of desktop traffic and is unlikely to\nmeaningfully close the gap, and 3) Instant Book is unlikely to help reverse the revenue\nand earnings trend. At the same time, TRIP has been accelerating marketing spend,\nimplying increasing acquisition costs, with further ad spend ramp in ‘17. TRIP noted\n2017 EBITDA margin will decline further from 2016 levels as ad spend ticks up to reaccelerate\ngrowth.\nTable 1: TripAdvisor key stock data\nIndustry\nOnline Travel\nMarket Cap (mn) $9,071\nPrice $46.95\nP/E (2017) 32.5x\n% of sell-side rated Buy 14.3%\nShort interest % of float 10.30%\nSource: Bloomberg and BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates\n14 Top 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017\nTax Policy: TRIP has a ~25% tax rate. Trump’s tax plan calls for a reduction in the\nbusiness tax rate from 35% to 15%, with elimination of most corporate tax\ndeductions/credits (except for the R&D credit). While it’s unclear what elements of the\ntax plan will eventually be executed, Trump’s intent is clear and we believe companies\nwith the highest tax rate have the most to gain. We see less incremental benefit to\nmany of the global companies who already enjoy optimized tax rates (22% average tax\nrate across our coverage), but many companies will have more incentive to bring back\nIntl profits for buybacks with lower US tax rates.\nCatalysts: 4Q’16 Earnings (early February) will feature initial 2017 guidance. TripAdvisor\nnoted on the 3Q’16 earnings call that 2017 EBITDA margin will decline further from\n2016 levels as ad spend ticks up to re-accelerate growth, however it is unclear how\nmuch margin deterioration TripAdvisor will guide to. We think the deterioration in the\nguide will be higher than the Street’s expectations, driving further downside estimate\nrevisions.\nLatest report: TripAdvisor: 2017 PM Level Outlook\n1Q risks: There is downside risk to Street estimates if hotel shopper growth comes in\nbelow expectations, mobile monetization gap widens, and if initial 2017 guidance\ndisappoints. We remain cautious on IB as an attempt to solve a very large problem: the\ncontinued transition of users consuming TripAdvisor’s content on their mobile phones\ninstead of their desktops. On mobile phones, users are much less likely to transact or\nclick on an ad than on desktops.\nA risk to the short thesis: There has been frequent speculation in the press that\nTripAdvisor may be a takeout candidate in the rapidly consolidating online travel market,\nwith Priceline frequently named as the likely suitor.\nCompany Description: TripAdvisor is the largest global online travel media company\nwith over millions of members and hundreds of millions of user reviews. The company's\nportfolio of web properties attracts over 300 million unique visitors per month\nworldwide.\nPrice objective basis & risk\nAetna Inc (AET)\nOur Price Objective of $149 is based on a 50/50 blend of our standalone AET valuation\n($138, 13.1x 2018E EPS of $10.50 when including share repurchase) and AET pro forma\nHUM valuation ($160, 14x 2018E EPS of $11.40). Our AET standalone valuation multiple\nreflects AET's historical average discount to the S&P 500. Our AET pro forma HUM\nvaluation multiple of 14x reflects upside levers to HUM synergy guidance and to reflect\nthe improved long-term growth profile of the company. Risks to the upside are\nregulatory approval of the HUM acquisition, better-than-expected membership growth\nand lower than expected cost trend. Risks to the downside are regulators not approving\nthe HUM acquisition, lower-than-expected membership growth and higher than\nexpected cost trend.\nConsolidated Edison (ED)\nOur price objective of $59 is predicated on shares of ED achieving 13.0x our 2019 EPS\nestimate. We apply the current group average multiple of 13.5x and apply a 0.5x\ndiscount to reflect a well below average ROE, a slightly below average growth profile,\nand a relatively challenging regulatory environment. This is offset slightly by a lower risk\nTop 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017 15\nprofile investment outlook. Upside risks to our thesis could stem from more favorable\nchanges to the investment and/or regulatory environment in New York.\nDownside/upside risks: ED, like all utility stocks, is also sensitive to changes in the\nmarket level of interest rates. Utilities historically underperform if bond yields rise, and\noutperform when they fall. Furthermore, ED is a bellwether utility and has historically\noutperformed during market uncertainty as a large liquid \"flight to safety\" stock.\nDover Corp (DOV)\nOur PO of $85 is based on 11.5x EV/EBITDA on our 2017 estimate, which would put\nDOV in line with the multi-industrial peer group average. We view the target multiple as\nconservative, as we expect the Street to focus on EPS growth upside in '17, driven by\nEnergy coming off depressed profitability.\nRisks to our PO are: 1) Highly dependent on acquisition strategy, 2) A reduction in\ncapital spending in the oil & gas market, and 3) Weak global industrial production\ngrowth.\nGeneral Dynamics (GD)\nWe derive our PO of $200 using a sum-of-the-parts valuation model. Our model factors\nin 19.5x P/E multiple on 2018E earnings for GD's defense business, which is in line with\npure play defense peers, and 18x P/E multiple on Gulfstream's 2018E earnings. In our\nview, GD's competitive business jet product portfolio and growth outlook in defense\ncould provide near-term and medium-term organic growth. Additionally, the company's\nstrong balance sheet and solid cash generation could sustain dividend growth and share\nrepurchases.\nDownside risks to our PO are: 1) A downturn in business jets, due to an exogenous\nfactor. 2) Given that business jets are priced in dollars, an unexpected devaluation in the\ndollar could significantly impact order activity, 3) We are forecasting a declining defense\nbudget, which would then place a cap on the top-line growth for the defense primes. We\nview the Administration change as a potential ceiling to defense stocks as political\ncontrol, in our view, is a key driver of defense spending. Decline in defense spending\nauthorization (a leading indicator), which in turn could impact treasury outlays. Potential\nbudget cuts to the Navy's fleet could encumber GD as well as a slowdown in\nprocurement for the Army (armored vehicles). 4) Poor execution on defense programs\ncould adversely impact margins.\nHess Corp. (HES)\nOur price objective of $80 / share is based on a 5-year outlook which assumes a 5.5x\nDACF multiple and a commodity deck of $67.50 WTI and $70 Brent to which we add\n$10 / sh for Liza in offshore Guyana. The multiple is based on a finite timeline to\ndelivery which is supported by core NAV.\nThe risks to our price objective are: 1) the oil and gas price environment, (2) slowdowns\nin development drilling that leave production below expectations, and (3) news flow\naround HES' exploratory and appraisal drilling activities that could impact the stock.\nMGM Resorts International (MGM)\nOur $33 PO is based on 11.5x our 2017 EBITDA estimate (implied 10x 2018E EBITDA).\nThis is in line with its historical trading range and supported by our detailed sum of the\nparts analysis.\nUpside risks are: a stronger than anticipated recovery in Las Vegas, improving consumer\nsentiment and its 56% ownership stake in MGM China. Downside risks are: balance\nsheet and liquidity risks proving worse than expected, continued Strip competition, and\ncontinuing near-term softness in the Macau market.\n16 Top 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017\nNorfolk Southern (NSC)\nOur $122 price objective is based on a 19.5x multiple on our 2017 EPS estimate of\n$6.25. We move above the top of its one-standard deviation historical trading range of\n12x-16x given the new management team's move to improve margins, cut costs, and\nraise its ROIC, and as EPS inflects off a volume deflated 19% decline in 2015.\nRisks to our price objective and estimates are the company's ability to derive continued\noperational benefits, a return to significant pricing competition among the rails, slower\nthan expected economic growth, a deterioration to improving service metrics, a heavily\nunionized employee base, inability to exercise pricing power due to regulatory changes\nor legal challenges from customers, external factors (such as weather) impacting\noperations, and the STB installing mandatory reciprocal switching (or open access) to\nthe rail network without proper pricing.\nSVB Financial Group (SIVB)\nWe use a three-factor valuation framework (P/TBV, P/E, DCF) to arrive at our $190 price\nobjective and assign a 2.3x multiple to our 2017e TBV and apply a 21x P/E to 17E EPS.\nOur valuation multiples are both in line with high growth peers due to SIVB's high\nprofitability and EPS growth profile. Our DCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of\n9.5% and a terminal growth rate of 6%.\nDownside risks are a longer than expected low rate environment and a slowdown in the\ntechnology sector and related IPO activity. Upside risks are sooner than expected rate\nhike, or better than expected pickup in the tech sector.\nTexas Instruments Inc. (TXN)\nOur $82 PO on TXN is based on14x FY17E EV/EBITDA, in line with high quality\ndiversified and analog peers trading at 14x-15x, given TXN's high quality business model\nand strong FCF generation.\nRisks to our price objective: 1) Lumpy telco capex, especially in wireless deployments, 2)\nVolatile market share as design cycle times are very long, 3) Increased R&D spending\npressure to maintain an edge versus the competition, 4) Inventory cycles and potential\ndouble ordering by customers that can often create mismatches between real supply\nand demand, 5) Exposure to several mature markets such as PC and other consumer\nelectronics could limit its growth rate.\nTripAdvisor (TRIP)\nOur price objective of $41 is based on 21x our 2018 non-GAAP EPS estimate. This\nmultiple represents a premium to online travel/vertical media comps and in our view\nadequately compensates TripAdvisor for improving margins and growth off a trough\npoint in FY16 into FY17 when the negative impacts of its IB transition peak.\nDownside risks to our price objective are: 1) increasing competition (e.g. Yelp), 2) macroeconomic\nfactors (e.g. recession in Europe) impacting the travel industry, 3) challenges\nto the credibility of online reviews, 4) Instant Book transition puts pressure on revenue\ngrowth, and 5) mobile monetization headwinds.\nUpside risks to our price objective are: 1) improved mobile monetization 2) major OTA\nsign on for instant booking 3) high non-hotel shopper dollar capture and 4) improved\nglobal macro environment.\nAnalyst Certification\nWe, Derek Harris, Andrew Obin, Brian Chin, Doug Leggate, Ebrahim H.

For purposes of this Investment Rating Distribution, the coverage universe includes only stocks. A\nstock rated Neutral is included as a Hold, and a stock rated Underperform is included as a Sell.\nFUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential\nprice fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)\nattractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total\nreturn of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than\nBuy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12\nmonth total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be\nreferenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).\nInvestment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*\nBuy ≥ 10% ≤ 70%\nNeutral ≥ 0% ≤ 30%\nUnderperform N/A ≥ 20%\n* Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.\nINCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays\nno cash dividend. Coverage Cluster is comprised of stocks covered by a single analyst or two or more analysts sharing a common industry, sector, region or other classification(s). A stock’s\ncoverage cluster is included in the most recent BofA Merrill Lynch report referencing the stock.\nPrice charts for the securities referenced in this research report are available at http://pricecharts.baml.com, or call 1-800-MERRILL to have them mailed.\nMLPF&S or one of its affiliates acts as a market maker for the equity securities recommended in the report: Aetna Inc, Consolidated Edison, Dover Corp, General Dynamics, Hess, MGM Resorts,\nNorfolk Southern, SVB Financial, Texas Instrument, TripAdvisor.\n28 Top 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017\nMLPF&S or an affiliate was a manager of a public offering of securities of this issuer within the last 12 months: Aetna Inc, Consolidated Edison, Dover Corp, General Dynamics, Hess, MGM\nResorts, Norfolk Southern, Texas Instrument.\nThe issuer is or was, within the last 12 months, an investment banking client of MLPF&S and/or one or more of its affiliates: Aetna Inc, Consolidated Edison, Dover Corp, General Dynamics, Hess,\nMGM Resorts, Norfolk Southern, Texas Instrument.\nMLPF&S or an affiliate has received compensation from the issuer for non-investment banking services or products within the past 12 months: Aetna Inc, Consolidated Edison, Dover Corp,\nGeneral Dynamics, Hess, MGM Resorts, Norfolk Southern, SVB Financial, Texas Instrument, TripAdvisor.\nThe issuer is or was, within the last 12 months, a non-securities business client of MLPF&S and/or one or more of its affiliates: Aetna Inc, Consolidated Edison, Dover Corp, General Dynamics,\nHess, MGM Resorts, Norfolk Southern, SVB Financial, Texas Instrument, TripAdvisor.\nMLPF&S or an affiliate has received compensation for investment banking services from this issuer within the past 12 months: Aetna Inc, Consolidated Edison, Dover Corp, General Dynamics,\nHess, MGM Resorts, Norfolk Southern, Texas Instrument.\nMLPF&S or an affiliate expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from this issuer or an affiliate of the issuer within the next three months: Aetna Inc,\nDover Corp, General Dynamics, Hess, MGM Resorts, Norfolk Southern, Texas Instrument.\nMLPF&S together with its affiliates beneficially owns one percent or more of the common stock of this issuer.

AI risk is not yet common knowledge either. In\nrelation to the timeline of the first dissident message, I’d say we’re around the year 1988,\nwhen raising the Soviet-occupation topic was no longer a career-ending move but you\nstill had to somewhat hedge your position. I hear similar hedging now—statements like,\n“Tm not concerned about superintelligent AI, but there are some real ethical issues in\nincreased automation,” or “It’s good that some people are researching AI risk, but it’s not\na short-term concern,” or even the very reasonable sounding, “These are small-\nprobability scenarios, but their potentially high impact justifies the attention.”\n\nAs far as message propagation goes, though, we are getting close to the tipping\npoint. A recent survey of AI researchers who published at the two major international AI\nconferences in 2015 found that 40 percent now think that risks from highly advanced AI\nare either “an important problem” or “among the most important problems in the field.””°\n\nOf course, just as there were dogmatic Communists who never changed their\nposition, it’s all but guaranteed that some people will never admit that AI is potentially\ndangerous. Many of the deniers of the first kind came from the Soviet nomenklatura;\nsimilarly, the AI-risk deniers often have financial or other pragmatic motives. One of the\nleading motives is corporate profits. Al is profitable, and even in instances where it isn’t,\nit’s at least a trendy, forward-looking enterprise with which to associate your company.\nSo a lot of the dismissive positions are products of corporate PR and legal machinery. In\nsome very real sense, big corporations are nonhuman machines that pursue their own\ninterests—interests that might not align with those of any particular human working for\nthem. As Wiener observed in Zhe Human Use of Human Beings: “When human atoms\nare knit into an organization in which they are used, not in their full right as responsible\nhuman beings, but as cogs and levers and rods, it matters little that their raw material is\nflesh and blood.”\n\nAnother strong incentive to turn a blind eye to the AI risk is the (very human)\ncuriosity that knows no bounds. “When you see something that is technically sweet, you\ngo ahead and do it and you argue about what to do about it only after you have had your\ntechnical success. That is the way it was with the atomic bomb,” said J. Robert\nOppenheimer. His words were echoed recently by Geoffrey Hinton, arguably the\ninventor of deep learning, in the context of AI risk: “I could give you the usual\narguments, but the truth is that the prospect of discovery is too sweet.”\n\nUndeniably, we have both entrepreneurial attitude and scientific curiosity to thank\nfor almost all the nice things we take for granted in the modern era. It’s important to\nrealize, though, that progress does not owe us a good future. In Wiener’s words, “It is\npossible to believe in progress as a fact without believing in progress as an ethical\nprinciple.”\n\nUltimately, we don’t have the luxury of waiting before all the corporate heads and\nAI researchers are willing to concede the AI risk.

She and Jared, or Jared, but by inference\nshe, too, were in effect the real chief of staff—or certainly as much a chief of staff as\nPriebus or Bannon, all of them reporting directly to the president. Or, even more to the\norganizational point, Jared and Ivanka had a wholly independent standing inside the West\nWing. A super status. Even as Priebus and Bannon tried, however diplomatically, to\nremind the couple of staff procedures and propriety, they would in turn remind the West\nWing leadership of their overriding First Family prerogatives. In addition, the president\nhad immediately handed Jared the Middle East portfolio, making him one of the\nsignificant international players in the administration—indeed, in the world. In the first\nweeks, this brief extended out to virtually every other international issue, about which\nnothing in Kushner’s previous background would have prepared him for.\n\nKushner’s most cogent reason for entering the White House was “leverage,” by which\nhe meant proximity. Quite beyond the status of being inside the family circle, anyone who\nhad proximity to the president had leverage, the more proximity the more leverage. Trump\nhimself you could see as a sort of Delphic oracle, sitting in place and throwing out\npronouncements which had to be interpreted. Or as an energetic child, and whomever\ncould placate or distract him became his favorite. Or as the Sun God (which is effectively\nhow he saw himself), the absolute center of attention, dispensing favor and delegating\npower, which could, at any moment, be withdrawn. The added dimension was that this\nSun God had little calculation. His inspiration existed in the moment, hence all the more\nreason to be there with him in the moment. Bannon, for one, joined Trump for dinner\nevery night, or at least made himself available—one bachelor there for the effective other\nbachelor. (Priebus would observe that in the beginning everyone would try to be part of\nthese dinners, but within a few months, they had become a torturous duty to be avoided.)\n\nPart of Jared and Ivanka’s calculation about the relative power and influence of a\nformal job in the West Wing versus an outside advisory role was the knowledge that\ninfluencing Trump required you to be all in. From phone call to phone call—and his day,\nbeyond organized meetings, was almost entirely phone calls—you could lose him. The\nsubtleties here were immense, because while he was often most influenced by the last\nperson he spoke to, he did not actually listen to anyone. So it was not so much the force of\nan individual argument or petition that moved him, but rather more just someone’s\npresence, the connection of what was going through his mind—and although he was a\nperson of many obsessions, much of what was on his mind had no fixed view—to\nwhomever he was with and their views.\n\nUltimately Trump may not be that different in his fundamental solipsism from anyone\nof great wealth who has lived most of his life in a highly controlled environment. But one\nclear difference was that he had acquired almost no formal sort of social discipline—he\ncould not even attempt to imitate decorum. He could not really converse, for instance, not\nin the sense of sharing information, or of a balanced back-and-forth conversation. He\nneither particularly listened to what was said to him, nor particularly considered what he\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019937\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It was\nAbdullah, the king’s son and later his successor, and he explained that he would\nbe in charge of handling security for the talks. For a few hours in the afternoon,\nwe held preliminary discussions, and I presented our assessment of the\nchallenges and options facing all the different players in the crisis. Then we\nretired to a dinner at which — despite the royal china, crystal and silverware —\nthe atmosphere was also surprisingly informal.\n\nThe main meeting came the next morning. Both sides recognized the\nseriousness of the issues we had to discuss. Shamir began with the one we\nassumed would be the least difficult. Israel was on a heightened state of military\nalert, prompted by Iraqi reconnaissance flights over Jordan, and the likelihood\nthe Iraqis were also hoping to get a look at our main nuclear research and\ndevelopment facility in the nearby Negev. It was important to ensure this didn’t\nlead to an unintended conflict between us and the Jordanians. While the king\nwas careful to steer clear of any detailed comment on the Iraqi moves, he made\nit clear that he understood our concern about stumbling into an Israeli-Jordanian\nconflict and agreed that we had to avoid doing so.\n\nYet the issue of our overflights, if we needed to attack the Scuds, was more\nsensitive. We said that if we did have to cross into Jordanian air space, we\nwould find whatever way the king suggested to make it as unobtrusive as\npossible. We raised the possibility of using a narrow air corridor. His response\nwas not hostile, but it was firm. This was an issue of Jordanian sovereignty, he\ntold us. He could not, and would not, collaborate in any way with an Israeli\nattack on another Arab state. It was Ephraim who tried to find a way around the\napparent stalemate. He suggested Shamir and the king withdraw to speak alone,\nad they met for nearly an hour. When Shamir emerged, clasping the king’s hand\nand thanking him for his hospitality, he turned to us and said: “OK. We’ re going\nhome.”\n\nHe didn’t tell us exactly what Hussein said. In the few sentences with which\nhe described the talks on the flight back, he said that, as a sovereign, Hussein\ncould not order his forces to ignore Israeli planes. But he added: “I assume there\nwill be no war with Jordan.” I took that to mean there might well be an attempt\nto intercept our jets, with the risk that either we or they might end up with one\nof our planes shot down, but that the king would use his authority and\nexperience to ensure this didn’t lead to a wider confrontation.\n\n233\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028081\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

After eight hours in the refrigerator, this\n\ncheesecake still hadn’t set at all. It swished in the gallon bowl like a viscous soup, chunks shifting and\nbobbing as I tilted it under close inspection. Somewhere a mistake had been made. It could have been\nany number of things:\n\nThree 1 Ib. sticks of Philly Cream Cheese\nEggs\n\nStevia\n\nUnflavored gelatin\n\nVanilla\n\nSour cream\n\nIn this case, it was probably a combination of things and the lack of a few simple ingredients that\ngenerally make cheesecake a form of cake.\n\nI was on a no-carbohydrate diet, and I had used this recipe before. It had been so delicious that my\nroommates wanted their fair share and insisted on an attempt at bulk production. Hence began the\nmathematical shenanigans and problems.\n\nBefore Splenda® and other miracles of sugar imitation came on the scene, the hard core used stevia,\nan herb 300 times sweeter than sugar. One drop was like 300 packets of sugar. It was a delicate tool and I\nwasn’t a delicate cook. I had once made a small handful of cookies using baking soda instead of baking\npowder, and that was bad enough to drive my roommates to puke on the lawn. This new masterpiece\nmade the cookies look like fine dining: It tasted like liquid cream cheese mixed with cold water and\nabout 600 packets of sugar.\n\nI then did what any normal and rational person would do: I grabbed the largest soup ladle with a sigh\nand sat down in front of the TV to face my punishment. I had wasted an entire Sunday and a boatload of\ningredients—it was time to reap what I had sown.\n\nOne hour and 20 large spoonfuls later, I hadn’t made a dent in the enormous batch of soup, but I was\ndown for the count. Not only could I not eat anything but soup for two days, I couldn’t bring myself to\neven look at cheesecake, previously my favorite dessert, for more than four years.\n\nStupid? Of course. It’s about as stupid as one can get. This is a ridiculous and micro example of what\npeople do on a larger scale with jobs all the time: self-imposed suffering that can be avoided. Sure, I\nlearned a lesson and paid for the mistake. The real question is—for what?\n\nThere are two types of mistakes: mistakes of ambition and mistakes of sloth.\n\nThe first is the result of a decision to act—to do something. This type of mistake is made with\nincomplete information, as it’s impossible to have all the facts beforehand. This is to be encouraged.\nFortune favors the bold.\n\nThe second is the result of a decision of sloth—to not do something—wherein we refuse to change a\nbad situation out of fear despite having all the facts. This is how learning experiences become terminal\npunishments, bad relationships become bad marriages, and poor job choices become lifelong prison\nsentences.\n\n“Yeah, but what if I’m in an industry where jumping around is looked down upon? I’ve been here\nbarely a year, and prospective employers would think...”\n\nWould they? Test assumptions before condemning yourself to more misery. I’ve seen one determinant\nof sex appeal to good employers: performance. If you are a rock star when it comes to results, it doesn’t\nmatter if you jump ship from a bad company after three weeks. On the other hand, if tolerating a\npunishing work environment for years at a time is a prerequisite for promotion in your field, could it be\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013952\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

At one point in its history, Haiti was a market leader in the textile industry supplying quality products. Currently there is an opportunity to provide sustainable employment for Haitians with the right training to develop an industry to serve as a catalyst to catapult the country out of the stigmatism of a third world country. There is a need for work to be done, such as construction of homes, infrastructure, etc.\n\nHaiti is one of the lowest-income countries in the Western hemisphere. The country has problems with AIDS, crime, drug trafficking, etc. (CIA, 2010). On January 12th, 2010, an earthquake destroyed the capital of the country and worsened the overall situation of Haiti. The total loss was estimated around $11.5 billion; however, the country still needs more time to rebuild (U.S. Department of State, 2010).  The majority of the donor countries worry about Haiti becoming a burden throughout the years without any positive results (Novacek et. al, 2008). The country has both positive and negative sides. \n\nThis business plan includes secondary data. Secondary data was selected from academic, government, news resources or based on extensive research by those with experience in dealing with Haiti. Considering retrieved data, the plan focused on the following aspects: \n  •  Past and current situations in Haiti; \n  •  A critical needs assessment of Southeastern area of Haiti;\n  •  Our plan for investment in Haiti\n\nAfter the detailed investigation of the authoritative sources and critically evaluating information, CEFOTAJ has concluded the following:\n  •  Haiti has a potential for investment in the area of apparel/clothing.\n\n  •  Establishment of our trade/learning school will facilitate and foster future investments within the country via job and economic growth in the southeastern area.\n\n  •  Despite its economic situation, the country attracts foreign investments and investors. \n\n  •  Foreign investments and aid allow restoring the country quicker.\n\n  •  Foreign investments positively affect the country.\n\n\n\n\n\f\nIntroduction\n\n\nBackground \n\nInvestment into another country or internalization is a very important and scrupulous decision that a business has to make. As a rule, developing countries seek to attract investors in order to gain FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) and acquire technology. Mainly, the investors seek for variety of factors when going international. \n\nThese factors include the following: \n  •  an area's business climate; education and training strengths; \n  •  labor unionization; attitudes of local and state governments; \n  •  available incentives;\n  •  community attitude; \n  •  commuting distance; \n  •  transportation costs and  proximity to roads;\n  •  availability of transportation facilities; \n  •  labor productivity and attitude toward productivity; \n  •  cost of labor; \n  •  availability of skilled and unskilled labor; \n  •  availability and transfer of qualified technicians and managers;\n  •  land availability and cost; cost of construction; proximity and access to markets;\n  •  availability and cost of utilities; \n  •  cost of living; \n  •  tax structures and rates; \n  •  insurance considerations; \n  •  financing opportunities; \n  •  banking services; \n  •  social and cultural climate; \n  •  quality of life; \n  •  local and physical infrastructure;\n  •  proximity to suppliers/resources; \n  •  access to raw materials; CEO ownership preferences; \n\nHaiti (Republic of Haiti) is not a very easy place to invest. The country has a very unstable social and economic situation. It experienced a massive 7.0 earthquake and several subsequently large tremors, which led to the deaths of many citizens in January 2010. Currently, the country is experiencing problems with cholera, AIDS, high crime rates, high unemployment, and high illiteracy among other things.  According to CIA Factbook Report (2010), 80% of the population lives “under the poverty line and 54% in abject poverty”. \n\n\fCountry Profile Background\n\n\n\nGeneral Geographical and Macroeconomic Situation\n\n\nHaiti (Republic of Haiti) is located on the western part of the island of Hispaniola (Greater Antillean archipelago in the Caribbean Sea). Haiti shares the island with the Dominican Republic. The geographical characteristics are follows:\n       •  Area: total: 27,750 sq km; land -  27,560 sq km; water -  190 sq km; \n       •  Area—comparative: slightly smaller than Maryland  \n       •  Climate: tropical; semiarid where mountains in east cut off trade winds  \n       •  Terrain: mostly rough and mountainous  \n       •  Natural resources: bauxite, copper, calcium carbonate, gold, marble, hydropower \n       •  Items imported: Haitian rum, beer, cigars, furniture, etc. \n       •  Literacy rate - 53 percent\n       •  Land use: arable land-  20% permanent crops - 3%; permanent pastures - 18%; forests and woodland- 5%; other- 44%.\n       •  Natural hazards: lies in the middle of the hurricane belt and subject to severe storms from June to October; occasional flooding and earthquakes; periodic droughts;\n       •  Environment—current issues: extensive deforestation (much of the remaining forested land is being cleared for agriculture and used as fuel); soil erosion; inadequate supplies of potable water  \n       •  Environment—international agreements: party to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Marine Life\n       •  More than two-thirds of the population live on less than $1 per day\n       •  Approximately 58 percent of the population is less than 25 years old.\n       •  Haiti ranks 154 of 177 countries in the UN's Human Development Index (CIA, 2010; USAID, 2009; The World Bank, 2010).\n\n\nLight manufactures ($165.1 million); fuel and lubricants ($651.8 million), essential oils ($17.8), mango ($10.0 million), cacao ($7.4 million) were the main exports. U.S. (69%), Dominican Republic (10.2%), Canada (3%), and Mexico (2.8%) were the main countries of exports. U.S. (43.8%), China (5.4%), Brazil (4.1%), Colombia (2.9%) were the main countries of import to Haiti in 2008. The country had mainly imported fuel and lubricants ($651.8 million), food ($616.9 million), manufactured goods ($242.7 million), and machinery/ transport equipment ($187.7 million) (CFI, 2009).\n\n\n\nU.S. and Haiti Relationship\nLong-term relationships between the U.S. and Haiti have been developed. First of all, the country has a very good geographical location. Port-au-Prince is less than 2 hours by air from Miami (approximately 600 miles southeast of the coast of Florida). Moreover, there are flights to New York and Fort Lauderdale. Secondly, English is well known in the country. Majority of the Haitian businesspersons speak English and it is possible to pay for the products in US dollars. Currently, there are some U.S. companies, including commercial banks, telecommunications, airlines, oil and agribusiness companies, and U.S.-owned assembly plants are present in Haiti (US Department of State, 2010; CIA, 2010).\n\nThe economic situation was largely dependent on the U.S. and entire world’s financial aid. For example, the U.S. contributed more than $850 million of financial aid from 1995 to 2003 to improve governance, security, the rule of law, economic recovery and critical human needs. From 2004 to 2008, the U.S. provided $600 million of financial aid. Moreover, The World Economic Forum ranked Haiti last in its 2003 Global Competitiveness Report (Global Security, n.d.; CFI, 2010). That is why World Bank Donors (U.S., Canada, EU, France, Sweden, Spain, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, Greece, Norway, Mexico, and Ireland) provided $1.085 billion from 2004 through 2006 to address humanitarian needs (U.S. Department of State, 2008).\n\n\n\nHaiti before the Earthquake in 2010\n\nHaiti had been the least-developed country in the Western Hemisphere since the 1980s. The economic stagnation of the country was a result of inadequate economic policies, political instability, shortage of arable land, environmental deterioration, lack of investment in human resources, migration of majority of skilled citizens, weak national savings rata, lack of functioning judicial system, corruption, reliance on traditional technologies instead of applying the new ones, drug trafficking, etc. (U.S. Department of State, 2008). A variety of the sources (U.S. Department of State, 2000; PRS Group, 2002; World Bank, 2004; Icon Group, 2007; Infomat, 2008; CFI, 2010) identified that Haiti had low trade with the foreign countries between 1990 and 2004 due to the political instability. Therefore, there were a limited number of foreign investors in Haiti. Later on, the political situation stabilized. \n\nGenerally, Haiti had a positive attitude towards foreign investors. There were no economic or industrial strategies with discriminatory effect, e.g. nationality. The Haitian banking system is open to the entry and operation of foreign banks.  At present, there are two foreign banks operating in Haiti: Citibank and Scotia bank (PRS Group, 2002; Investment Overview, 2007). \n\nThe Government of Haiti has made several commitments to the world trade organization in the financial services sector as follows:\n•  Allow foreign participation in deposit taking, lending, guarantees and commitments; in financial leasing; in underwriting services, including participation in the issuance and placement of securities; and in advising and auxiliary services for each of the above-mentioned services.\n•  The tax code includes a withholding tax provision that discriminates against foreign investors (PRS Group 2002, PRS Group 2003, PRS Group, 2005, PRS Group, 2009; USAID, 2006).\n\nAs a rule, investment in “sensitive” sectors, such as electricity, water and telecommunications require special government concession. Investment in the public health sector requires authorization from the Ministry of Public Health and Population. Investment in agriculture is subject to the Ministry of Agriculture’s approval. Exploiting mineral and energy resources require permits from the Office of Mining and Energy. Besides, natural resources are considered as the property of the country (PRS Group, 2009; Schaaf, 2009).\n\n\nHaiti after the Earthquake in 2010\n\nThe January 12th, 2010 earthquake had inflicted massive human and financial damage to the country. The natural disaster damaged homes, commercial & government buildings, cities infrastructure, and took many people lives. The estimated monetary loss is $11.5 billion (U.S. Department of State, 2010). \n\nAccording to the World Bank report (2010), 70% of the total damage and losses were done in the private sector. Therefore, this has lead to the loss of production, reduction in revenues, loss of jobs and wages, increase in production cost, etc. Additionally, the job market experienced 8.5 % of pre-earthquake jobs decrease due to devastation. \n\nNinety percent of businesses are informal in Haiti; ninety-five percent of businesses are SME (Small and Medium sized Enterprise). Business people indicated having various problems due to the natural disaster. Some of them lost their houses and facilities; therefore, they do not have money for rebuilding all the facilities. However, a vast majority of businesses do not pay taxes and do not contribute to the countries’ official GDP (Investment Facilitation centre, 2010). \n\n\n\nGovernment Role in Economy\n\nGenerally, government’s role in the economy is minimal. There are several government subsidies and price controls; however, goods are mainly traded at market prices. Considering the fact that there are over 70 % of imports in Haiti, the Haitian government has eliminated tariffs and non-tariff barriers in order to liberalize trade (CIA, 2010; World Bank, 2010; PRS Group, 2009). \n\nAt the same time, there is a project for creating several trade free zones and exclusion from the taxes of the foreign investors (PRS Group, 2009. \n\n\n\nProject Overview\n\n\n\nDescription\n\nHaitian manufacturing has been well known in the world. As recently as the mid 1980’s, Haiti was known as the staple for baseball production.  After labor unrests occurred, corporations moved their operations out of Haiti to China and other countries. Haiti went from employing 150,000 workers in the textile industry to a current level of 20,000.  Haiti occupies the lowest ranks in the world’s ranking among the countries. As a rule, the country is perceived as politically unstable, being subject to various natural disasters, and having increasing security problems. For example, the political difficulties related to the Presidential election had led to the suspension of funding for major infrastructure rehabilitation by most international and bilateral donors.  \n\nThe Centre de Formation Technique pour L’Avancement des Jeunes du Sud-est (CEFOTAJ) was created by members who trace their roots to the beautiful city known as Haiti’s cultural center to increase general awareness of the dangers facing idle young women and men. The city, a population of 60,000, is considered a major production center of arts and creativity and is determined by CEFOTAJ members as the ideal location to establish a trade school.\n\n In support of the Government of Haiti’s National Action Plan to produce centers of economic development outside the capital of Port-au-Prince, CEFOTAJ plans to ensure Haiti’s future development by bringing much needed training skills for the textile industry to support the creation of jobs to Haiti’s underserved regions. \n\nBased on our target group of attracting over 100 youths with 75 enrolling and being trained for the project, we have formulated a free association questionnaire that we would pose to individuals within the community in order to assess whether the community believes this avenue of job skill creation would be fruitful. The following questionnaire would be utilized to engage the community in open ended discussions about their future and viability of a successful training center:\n.\nSurvey Questionnaire\n\t\n       1.  A job training center in our community would                                     .\n\t\n       2.  Without a job I believe                                     .\n\n\t\n       3.  The textile industry in Haiti has                                     .\n\n\t\n       4.  I would like                                     .to occur in my community.\n\n\t\n       5.  The young people in the Jacmel community                                      .\n\n\t\n\n\n\nThe establishment of a training center would seek to achieve the following goals;\n\n       •  Mobilize the local population\n       •  Workers technically trained for couture\n\n       •  Promotion of couture in Haiti\n\n       •  Establishment of a major element in the structure for bringing the assembly industry into the area\n\n       •  Strengthening of institutional structures\n\n\n\nSWOT Analysis\n\n\nWhen considering market entrance strategy for the business, there were several opportunities and threats that were considered before starting the business or investing in this Haitian industry. The SWOT analysis was based on information provided in the secondary sources (PRS Group, 2009, Schaaf, 2009, The World bank, 2006; The World Bank, 2010; Investment Overview, 2007; CFI, 2010; Economy watch, n.d.; Ozdenli & Bennet, 2007; Icon Group, 2007; Novacek et. al, 2008)\n\n                    Strengths\n\t                    Weaknesses\n\t\n\n    •  Low cost of production\n    •  Possibility to outsource the services \n    •  High demand for work\n    •  Tax exclusion\n    •  Positive legal and regulatory environment\n    •  Geographical proximity compared to China\n    •  Previous experience with foreign partners\n    •  Skilled professionals speak three languages (French, English, and Spanish). \n    •  The country’s population is quite young (43% under 15 years, 4% above 65 years) \n\n\t\n    •  Lack of professionals\n    •  Bad overall situation in the country\n    •  Dependence on the world’s aid\n    •  Corrupted environment  & shadow economy\n    •  Low literacy rate\n    •  Underdeveloped transport, city, rural, telecommunication, etc. infrastructure \n    •  Haiti experiences many natural disasters (flooding, earthquake, draught, etc.)\n    •  Great dependence on foreign aid and imports\n    •  Enormous rich-poor gap (1% of society owns 44% of the wealth) \n\t\n                    Opportunities\n\t                    Threats\n\t\n\n    •  Incorporate the best creative minds from Haitian Community\n    •  Presence of financial partners to support the new investment project\n    •  Haitian Diaspora in the U.S. is concerned about Haiti and willing to help\n\t\n    •  Unstable political situation & Reliance on foreign aid\n    •  Insecure country with unequal access to the police protection and security services to all people in Haiti \n    •  Change in the regulations to less favorable ones\n    •  Corruption, Money laundering activities\n\t\n\n\n\nResults\n\nResearch and Market (2010) research identified the global plan of South Korean company, Sae-A Trading Company Limited, that has built an industrial park and garment making operation in Haiti with the financial support of the World Bank's IFC financing arm and the U.S. State Department. This has provided an initial 20,000 people jobs. Furthermore, A USAID funded Apparel Training Center opened its doors in August 2010 to assist in the training of individuals to rebuild the industrial garment industry in Haiti.  Both projects have received the full backing of the Haitian government as well as the U.S. government.\nThere were various investigations and researches aimed to identify the best areas to invest and market opportunities in Haiti. In order to combine and identify the main trends, the most reliable and authoritative sources were selected and investigated. The list given below provides the summary of the findings:\n\n\n  •  Apparel sector, agribusiness, electronics (US Trade and Developing Agency cited by Fagenson, n.d.);\n•  Apparel, agribusiness, and tourism (Haitian Investment Facilitation Center, 2010);\n  •  Apparel (Research and Marketing, 2010);\n  •  Development and trade of raw and processed agricultural products; medical supplies and equipment; rebuilding and modernizing Haiti's depleted infrastructure; developing tourism and allied sectors--including arts and crafts; and improving capacity in waste disposal, transportation, energy, telecommunications, and export assembly operations (U.S.. Department of State, 2008). \n  •  Apparel, telecommunications, reforestation, agribusiness, call centers (Clinton, 2010).\n\n\nAccording to Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) act, a U.S. company has duty-free export of many Haitian products assembled from U.S. components or materials. Therefore, U.S. companies can outsource labor force from Haiti and experience exclusion from taxes in Haiti. Moreover, they would have less transportation expenses if compared to China, Vietnam, or Taiwan. The HOPE and HOPE II (Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement) Act is another positive legal document for the businesses from the U.S. According to this act, there are additional duty-free preferences for qualifying apparel/textiles products and automotive wire harnesses. \n\nAdditionally, The Haitian Economic Lift Program (HELP) Act that was passed in May 2010 expands the duty-free treatment of imported apparel made in Haiti or the Dominican Republic. These new regulations are developed to attract large corporations and apparel manufacturers, especially from South Korea and Brazil (U.S. Department of State, 2010; PRS Group, 2005; Research and Markets, 2010).\n\nAfter detailed evaluation of the overall situation in the country and methods of community development, CEFOTAJ came to the following expected results indicated in the following sections:\n\n\n\nTraining Plan \n\nThis project’s goal is to improve the living conditions of urban young people. It aims specifically at the establishment of new social structures for youth. This project consists particularly in training them in handling of scissors, cutting of canvas, training in patterns, use of the computer in couture, and the use of specialized sewing machines. The project will be implemented in Jacmel.\n\nA solid structure will be established to work on complete implementation of the project, which will be carried out by CEFOTAJ.  The project will be managed by the administrative committee of CEFOTAJ.   The goal of the Center is to instruct individuals in almost all facets of the textile industry in relation to working in a factory.  Students will be trained efficiently and effectively to the following techniques:\n     •  Handling of scissors\n\n     •  Cutting of canvas\n\n     •  Preparation of patterns\n\n     •  Use of the computer in sewing\n\n     •  Use of specialized sewing machines\n\n     •  Finished product for the international market\n\n     •  Evaluation and adjustment of the finished product\n\n     •  Quality of garments according to the seasons\n\n\n\nThe center has formulated a plan to devise students into three distinct groups to be trained in. Students accepted to the center will be developed via one of the following:\n\n  •  Young people who have no knowledge of garment-making. Their training will last for one year.\n  •  Young people who already have some knowledge of garment-making. Their training will last for nine months.\n  •  Young people who are interested in haute couture. This is a three-year training program.\n\nThe trainees will not be charged entrance fees or monthly payments. However, they will have to obtain the tools necessary for their training.\n\nThe trainees will be chosen on the following bases:\n\n  •  Level of education: primary school equivalency for the first two groups\n  •  Completion of secondary-school equivalency for the third group\n  •  Admission examination designed to evaluate the applicants’ understanding of geometric and mathematical concepts\n  •  Age level: 18 to 35\n\nA certificate will be issued to students who pass the final examination after completing their training. The list of new garment-industry workers will be given to entrepreneurs looking to hire workers. The project has a term cycle of three years at which point a full assessment will be reviewed in preparation for future subsequent cycles.\n\n\n\nExecution Schedule\n\nActivities                                   M1   M2   M3   M4   M5   M6   M7   M8  M9   M10   M11   M12\n\n\t\nMobilization                                XXXX\n\n\t\nRecruitment                                                 XXXX\n\n\t\nTraining                                                                  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\n\t\nMonitoring and evaluation          XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  \n\n\t\nAnnual report                                                                                                        XXXXXXXXX\n\n\t\n\n\n\nForecasted Budget\n\nThe total operating cost of the project is estimated at US$359,731.\n\nThe financing will be obtained as by contributions by members of the organization, grants by philanthropists interested in such projects, companies that specialize in assembly, under conditions that comply with the regulations and bylaws of the NGO, and by international financial backers interested in the development of Haiti.\n\nThe listed prices on schedules C, D, and E represent an on average estimate based upon utilizing marketplace prices for items quoted within the United States as well as the professional experience of the President of the organization.  Schedules A and B were determined based on a blend of Haitian labor rates as well as some influence from US labor rates.  The budgeted amounts for labor are considered heavily competitive within the Haitian workforce.\n\nThe costs, which are listed in USD, are broken down as follows:\n\n LINK Excel.Sheet.8 \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Yair\\\\Documents\\\\CEOFTAJ CHARTS.xlsx!A B and C!R5C3:R32C6\" \"\" \\a \\p \\* MERGEFORMAT  \n LINK Excel.Sheet.8 \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Yair\\\\Documents\\\\CEOFTAJ CHARTS.xlsx!D!R5C3:R32C6\" \"\" \\a \\p \\* MERGEFORMAT  \n\n\n\n LINK Excel.Sheet.8 \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Yair\\\\Documents\\\\CEOFTAJ CHARTS.xlsx!E!R5C3:R32C6\" \"\" \\a \\p \\* MERGEFORMAT  \n\n\fAppendix\n\nBracken, Amy (2010) Recycled trash to fuel Haiti.

Ever since the Carter administration first explored the possibility\nwith Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese counterparts of sending Chinese students to\nthe United States in 1977—78,1 PRC government authorities (like their Republican-era\npredecessors) have seen American universities as integral to China’s economic and\nscientific development. For the first two decades after normalization, the Chinese\ngovernment placed a priority on sending students in STEM subjects (Science,\nTechnology, Engineering, Mathematics). Over time, however, fields of study broadened\ninto the humanities, social sciences, and the arts, a change that has mirrored the shift\nin educational exchange from primarily a state-directed to a private consumer-driven\nphenomenon that saw an increasing number of middle-class Chinese parents opting\nto send their children to the United States for liberal arts undergraduate university,\nand even secondary school education. The net result has been that several million\nChinese students have now successfully matriculated through the US higher education\nsystem. During the 2017-2018 academic year, for instance, a record 350,755 Chinese\nstudents were enrolled in American universities (with an additional 80,000 in high\nschools), out of a total of 1.5 million Chinese students studying worldwide in the\nsame year.* (Altogether, since the late 1970s, an estimated 5.2 million Chinese have\nattended foreign universities.)* Unlike the early years of this epic exchange, a majority\nof Chinese students have become able to pay full tuition, creating an extremely\nsignificant source of revenue for financially stressed American universities and colleges.\n(Chinese pay tuition worth an estimated $12 billion per year, according to the US\nDepartment of Commerce.)>\n\nUS universities and American society have benefited significantly from this exchange,\nand from the presence of international students generally. Chinese students have\nhelped to diversify the makeup of US student bodies, they often contribute positively\nin the classroom, and they have made a real contribution in joint research projects\nwith university faculty. Many have remained in the United States postgraduation to\npursue professional careers, build their lives, and become American citizens—a sizable\ncontribution to American society, to the US economy, and to technological innovation\nand the knowledge base in numerous fields. The engineering, medical, and hard\nsciences have benefited particularly, but so have the humanities and social sciences.\nIndeed, those who negotiated the initial educational and scientific exchange accords\nback in 1978-1979 could never have envisioned how much of a success story US-China\nhigher educational exchanges would become over the next four decades.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020498\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It is a theoretical overview of predictive modeling for robots and does not provide actionable leads or novel controversy involving powerful actors.", "key_insights": ["Emphasizes need for robots to predict human actions and internal states.", "Notes mutual influence between humans and robots.", "Advocates transparency and mental‑model alignment."], "tags": ["AI safety", "human‑robot interaction", "predictive modeling"], "power_mentions": [], "agency_involvement": [], "lead_types": [], "metadata": {"source_row_index": 22348, "original_row": {"filename": "IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016903.txt", "text": "This need to understand human actions and decisions applies to physical and\nnonphysical robots alike. If either sort bases its decision about how to act on the\nassumption that a human will do one thing but the human does something else, the\nresulting mismatch could be catastrophic. For cars, it can mean collisions. For an AI\nwith, say, a financial or economic role, the mismatch between what it expects us to do\nand what we actually do could have even worse consequences.\n\nOne alternative is for the robot not to predict human actions but instead just\nprotect against the worst-case human action. Often when robots do that, though, they\nstop being all that useful. With cars, this results in being stuck, because it makes every\nmove too risky.\n\nAll this puts us, the AI community, into a bind. It suggests that robots will need\naccurate (or at least reasonable) predictive models of whatever people might decide to do.\nOur state definition can’t just include the physical position of humans in the world.\nInstead, we’ ll also need to estimate something internal to people. We’ll need to design\nrobots that account for this human internal state, and that’s a tall order. Luckily, people\ntend to give robots hints as to what their internal state is: Their ongoing actions give the\nrobot observations (in the Bayesian inference sense) about their intentions. If we start\nwalking toward the right side of the hallway, we’re probably going to enter the next room\non the right.\n\nWhat makes the problem more complicated 1s the fact that people don’t make\ndecisions in isolation. It would be one thing if robots could predict the actions a person\nintends to take and simply figure out what to doin response. But unfortunately this can\nlead to ultra-defensive robots that confuse the heck out of people. (Think of human\ndrivers stuck at four-way stops, for instance.) What the intent-prediction approach misses\nis that the moment the robot acts, that influences what actions the human starts taking.\n\nThere is a mutual influence between robots and people, one that robots will need\nto learn to navigate. It is not always just about the robot planning around people; people\nplan around the robot, too. It is important for robots to account for this when deciding\nwhich actions to take, be it on the road, in the kitchen, or even in virtual spaces, where\nactions might be making a purchase or adopting a new strategy. Doing so should endow\nrobots with coordination strategies, enabling them to take part in the negotiations people\nseamlessly carry out day to day—from who goes first at an intersection or through a\nnarrow door, to what role we each take when we collaborate on preparing breakfast, to\ncoming to consensus on what next step to take on a project.\n\nFinally, just as robots need to anticipate what people will do next, people need to\ndo the same with robots. This is why transparency is important. Not only will robots\nneed good mental models of people, but people will need good mental models of robots.\nThe model that a person has of the robot has to go into our state definition as well, and\nthe robot has to be aware of how its actions are changing that model. Much like the robot\ntreating human actions as clues to human internal states, people will change their beliefs\nabout the robot as they observe its actions. Unfortunately, the giving of clues doesn’t\ncome as naturally to robots as it does to humans; we’ve had a lot of practice\ncommunicating implicitly with people. But enabling robots to account for the change\nthat their actions are causing to the person’s mental model of the robot can lead to more\ncarefully chosen actions that do give the right clues—that clearly communicate to people\nabout the robot’s intentions, its reward function, its limitations.

He has paid for\ncollege educations for personal employees and students from Rwanda, and spent millions\non a project to develop a thinking and feeling computer and on music intended to\nalleviate depression.\n\nBut Mr. Epstein also paid women, some of them under age, to give him massages that\nended with a sexual favor, the authorities say.\n\nFederal prosecutors initially threatened to bring him to trial on a variety of charges and\nseek the maximum penalty, 10 years in prison. After years of legal wrangling, Mr.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to lesser state charges.\n\nUpon his release from jail, he must register as a sex offender wherever he goes in the\nUnited States.\n\nPeople from all walks of life break the law, of course. But for the rich, wrapped in a\ncocoon of immense comfort, it can be easy to yield to temptation, experts say.\n\n“A sense of entitlement sets in,” said Dennis Pearne, a psychologist who counsels people\n\non matters related to extreme wealth. The attitude, he said, becomes, “I deserve anything\nI want, I can have anything I want — and I can afford it.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021786\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

His overall\ncontention was that Wiener missed the implications of the digital revolution that was\nhappening around him—although some would say this charge can’t be leveled at\nsomeone on the ground floor and lacking clairvoyance.\n\n“The tail wagging the dog of my life,” he told us, “has been Fab Labs and the\nmaker movement, and [when] Wiener talks about the threat of automation he misses the\ninverse, Which is that access to the means for automation can empower people, and in\nFab Labs, the corner I’ve been involved in, that’s an exponential.”\n\nIn 2003, I visited Neil at MIT, where he runs the Center for Bits and Atoms.\nHours later, I emerged from what had been an exuberant display of very weird stuff. He\nshowed me the work of one student in his popular rapid-prototyping class (“How to\nMake Almost Anything”), a sculptor with no engineering background, who had made a\nportable personal space for screaming that saves up your screams and plays them back\nlater. Another student in the class had made a Web browser that lets parrots navigate\nthe Net. Neil himself was doing fundamental research on the roadmap to that sci-fi\nstaple, a “universal replicator.” It was a visit that took me a couple of years to get my\nhead around.\n\nNeil manages a global network of Fab Labs—small-scale manufacturing systems,\nenabled by digital technologies, which give people the wherewithal to build whatever\nthey'd like. As guru of the maker movement, which merges digital communication and\ncomputation with fabrication, he sometimes feels outside the current heated debate on AI\nsafety. “My ability to do research rests on tools that augment my capabilities,” he says.\n“Asking whether or not they are intelligent is as fruitful as asking how I know I exist—\namusing philosophically, but not testable empirically.”” What interests him is “how bits\nand atoms relate—the boundary between digital and physical.

But others almost uniformly use one word to\ndescribe the chief: professional.\n\n\"I have always been impressed by Mike's professionalism and his leadership,\" said Rick Lincoln, chief of the\nLantana Police Department and a Palm Beach County cop for 32 years.\n\n\"The town of Palm Beach has a very professional police department. We all consider Mike to be our peer and a\nman of integrity.\"\n\nJuno Beach Police Chief H.C. Clark Il agreed. Although he doesn't know Reiter well, he has met with him on\ncountywide law enforcement issues. \"I've never seen him lose his cool. I've never seen anything but a\nprofessional demeanor from him.\"\n\nReiter joined the Palm Beach Police Department in 1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year patrol job at the University\nof Pittsburgh. His personnel jacket shows consistently excellent job evaluations.\n\nPosh Palm Beach is no hotbed of crime, and in his first year on the job, a resident confined to his home with a\nsick child thanked Reiter for delivering a few Cokes to the house. Reiter refused payment for the beverages.\nAnother resident thanked Reiter for shutting off his car's headlights in his driveway, saying a valet must have\nbeen at fault.\n\nReiter worked everything from road patrol to organized crime, vice and narcotics. And he's no novice at\ninvestigations involving the island's rich and famous. He was the lead detective probing the drug overdose\ndeath of David Kennedy in 1984. He also was one of the officers who worked the investigation of William\nKennedy Smith, who was charged in 1991 — and later acquitted — with raping a woman at the Kennedy\nfamily compound in Palm Beach.\n\nReiter, who has a master's degree in human resource development from Palm Beach Atlantic University, also\nhas attended the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Va., and management courses at Harvard.

Reiter makes more than $144,000 as\nthe town's top cop. Elwell thinks he's worth it.\n\n\"He's very businesslike, very straightforward. He's not easily agitated or flamboyant.

Edwards’\nattorney responded by stating that based on “sworn testimony and private interviews” he had\n“placed [Dershowitz] in the presence of Jeffrey Epstein on multiple occasions... when Jeffrey\nEpstein was in the company of underage females subsequently identified as victims.” (DE 291 at\n13, 14.) Again, no allegations were made at that time by Edwards’ attorney, or by anyone else,\nthat Prof. Dershowitz engaged in any inappropriate conduct or witnessed any inappropriate\nconduct related to Jeffrey Epstein and underage females.

These models map linguistic symbols to concepts, and relate\nconcepts to each other, but they do not relate the concepts to \"proper\" mental representations of what objects\nand processes look like and how they interact.

Personal favorites: (1)\nAthleta carries excellent, light, quick-dry clothing that hold up well to sports but still look very\nfashionable. Skorts are a must for looking feminine but being fully covered for hiking and steep pyramid\nsteps—you know what I mean, ladies! Just a note, a slightly longer length will serve you well in a lot of\ncountries, as well as tankini tops and swim skirts for swimming. (2) Fresh & Go toothbrush is simple to\nuse. (3) Marsona sound machine for drowning out unfamiliar noises is a must (regularly use with baby at\nhome too so when they hear the sound they know it’s sleep time!). This has been a lifesaver for us on\nmany trips, and we now use it regularly at home for better sleep. No more changing hotels midtrip to\navoid noise. AND, I know we have to travel light, but with baby a lot of things are nonnegotiable. These\nmake for smoother sailing: (1) Peanut shell sling in black fleece—it’s more comfy than the cotton and\nyou can pop baby in and out wherever you are, from birth to 35 Ibs. I never take mine off, it’s part of my\noutfit; (2) Peapod plus portable tent—this is baby’s main bed at home and travel so baby has the same\nsleep place everywhere we go, and the flaps give all travel parties privacy— great from small babies to\nfive-year-olds. I can still jam this onto a little wheeled carry-on and pack mine and baby’s minimal\nclothing around it; (3) Go Go Kidz TravelMate (great for wheeling car seat up to the gate for gate check\nor use on plane); (4) Britax Diplomat car seat is small but kids can use it from birth to approx. four years\nold.\n\nMake sure the wheeled carry-on bag you get is one size smaller than the allowed carry-on size so you\ndon’t get bumped to check the bag in if the plane is full. You can always nicely argue/reason/bat your\neyelashes that you will put the bag in your foot space. Also, very helpful to give baby something to sip\nor munch on during take off and landing so yours isn’t the baby screaming from ear pain.

President Bush smiled in response.\nHe said he didn’t deal with “hypotheticals.”\n\nYet any idea of an Israeli attack on Saddam became instantly irrelevant once\nforeign media reports had disclosed the reason for our ill-fated military exercise\nin the Negev. Inside Israel, the focus, and the controversy, shifted to the\naccident itself.\n\nThe foreign media reports of the operation we were planning proved\nremarkably accurate. Some of the details still remain classified, but we were\ngoing to use one of our new “stand-off” weapons systems: a camera-guided\nmissile that could be fired from a considerable distance away and, in\ncoordination with one of the Sayeret Matkal soldiers nearer in, maneuvered in\nfor the strike. After months of planning and intelligence work, we were\nconfident that we’d found a way to get the sayeret unit into Iraq, target Saddam\nat an event we knew he would be attending, isolate and kill him with minimal\ndanger of any other casualties, and get our unit out safely again. The Negev\nexercise was a run-through of the entire operation. It lasted nearly 48 hours. And\nit culminated in a simulation of the missile attack on Saddam.\n\nI was there as an observer along with Amnon Lipkin, my deputy chief-of-\nstaff; as well as the head of military intelligence, the head of operations and\nAmiram Levin. We assembled at dawn for the simulation of the missile attack.\nWe watched from a few hundred yards away as a group of young Israeli soldiers\nwalked into a wide area in front of us: posing as Saddam” and his entourage.\nWe — and they — knew that this was just the first part of the exercise.

Rev. 861, *865\n\nA. The Crime Victims’ Rights Movement\n\nThe Crime Victims' Rights Movement developed in the 1970s because of a perceived imbalance in the criminal justice system.\n\nThe victims' absence from criminal processes conflicted with \"a public sense of justice keen enough that ... it has found voice\nin a nationwide \"victims' rights' movement.\" © Victims advocates argued that the criminal justice system had become\npreoccupied with defendants’ rights to the exclusion of considering the legitimate interests of crime victims. ’ These advocates\nurged reforms to give more attention to victims' concerns, including protecting victims’ rights to be notified of court hearings,\nto attend those hearings, and to be heard at appropriate points in the process.\n\nThe victims movement received considerable impetus in 1982 with the publication of the report of the President's Task Force\non Victims of Crime (\"Task Force\"). The Task Force concluded that \"the criminal justice system has lost an essential balance...\n. The system has deprived the innocent, the honest, and the helpless of its protection... . The victims of crime have been\ntransformed into a group oppressively burdened by a system designed to protect them. This oppression must be reddressed.\" 8\nThe Task Force advocated multiple reforms. It recommended that prosecutors assume the responsibility for keeping victims\nnotified of all court proceedings and bringing to the court's attention the victim's view on such subjects as bail, plea bargains,\nsentences, and restitution. ° It also urged that courts receive victim-impact evidence at sentencing, order restitution in most\ncases, and allow victims and their families to attend trials even if they would [*866] be called as witnesses. !° In its most\nsweeping recommendation, the Task Force proposed a federal constitutional amendment to protect crime victims’ rights \"to be\npresent and to be heard at all critical stages of judicial proceedings.\" |!\n\nIn the wake of the recommendation for a constitutional amendment, crime victims' advocates considered how best to pursue\nthat goal. Realizing the difficulty of achieving the consensus required to amend the United States Constitution, advocates\ndecided to go first to the states to enact state victims’ rights amendments. They have had considerable success with this \"states-\nfirst\" strategy. !? To date, about thirty states have adopted amendments to their own state constitutions, | which protect a\nwide range of victims’ rights.\n\n® Payne v.

These instances of shaming might\ndeter bad behavior, but critics like Martha Nussbaum, a political philosopher at the University of\nChicago, argue that shaming by the state conflicts with the law’s obligation to protect citizens\nfrom insults to their dignity.'°\n\nWhat if government is not involved in the shaming? A neighborhood in Leicester,\nEngland, has a YouTube channel dedicated to neighborhood issues, including catching “litter\nlouts.” A collection of videos shows individuals caught in various acts of littering, and if\nsomeone recognizes the litter lout, he or she can e-mail the lout’s identity to the neighborhood\nmanagement board, which they pass on to City Council so that fines can be issued and the video\nremoved. In 2008, the Santa Fe Reporter published the names and addresses of the top ten\nwater-using households in the city (first place went to a homeowner who used twenty-one times\nthe household average). The tennis club near my apartment in Vancouver, B.C. publishes the\nnames of people who do not pay their dues. In each of these cases, the activity of the individual\ncompromises the community. In none of them is the state involved in the shaming. Is this a fair\nuse of shaming? Is it effective?\n\nLet’s deal with the latter question. Shaming might work to change behavior in these\ncases, but in a world of urgent, large-scale problems, changing individual behavior is\ninsignificant. Small changes, adopted by one individual at a time, can make a difference in a\n\nproblem only when the problem is small or there is lots of time to solve it (for instance, in\n\n‘0M.

L. Rev. 844, *877\n\n[*878]\n3. Federal Oversight of Declination Decisions\n\nIn the United States, only the federal justice system provides for a process of administrative review somewhat comparable to\nthose in E.U. member states. Federal law grants victims a right to seek review of prosecutors' decisions within the Department\nof Justice hierarchy, although it also explicitly bars judicial review of Justice Department decisions in this process. !!4\nAlthough decision makers in an internal review process have less institutional independence from those they review than do\njudges engaged in judicial review, they also have a comparative advantage in institutional expertise, which could translate into\n\nless deference to, and more meaningful oversight of, front-line prosecutors.\n\nIn addition, federal law guarantees victims \"the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case.\"\n115 The Department of Justice interprets this not to create a right to confer before charges are filed, reasoning that no \"case\"\nexists until charges are filed. '!® Some lower courts have interpreted the statute differently, however, and concluded that it\n[*879] creates an enforceable right for victims to confer with prosecutors before, and about, the charging decision. One held\nthat prosecutors cannot enter a non-prosecution agreement with a suspect until they confer with victims, and that if they fail to\n\ndo so the court can order prosecutors to re-open the non-prosecution agreement. !!7 A few other lower federal courts have\n\nreached similar conclusions, !18 119\n\nalthough at least two have opposing conclusions.\nEven in its stronger form, this is a limited entitlement, in effect, to an opportunity to try to influence charging decisions. Even\nthe most aggressive federal courts on this point do not examine prosecutors’ good faith during consultations or their reasons for\ndisagreeing with victims. In sum, neither the consultation right nor the right to review by Justice Department supervisors\ninfringes federal prosecutors’ monopoly power over charging from judicial oversight.\n\nfor the court calendar). England had no full-scale prosecution agency until the creation of the Crown Prosecution Service in the Prosecution\nof Offences Act 1985. See Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, c. 23. The Director of Public Prosecutions office was established in 1879, but it\nsupplemented rather than displaced private prosecution. See Glanville Williams, The Power to Prosecute, Crim. L. Rev. 596, 601-03 (1955)\n(noting 1879 creation of Director of Public Prosecutions and describing police as de facto public prosecutors).\n\n7 See Parrillo, supra note 58.\n\n8° Professional police forces did not arise until the 1850s, so victims investigated crimes and arrested offenders. See Peggy M. Tobolowsky,\nVictim Participation in the Criminal Justice Process: Fifteen Years After the President's Task Force on Victims of Crime, 25 New Eng. J.\nCrim. & Civ. Confinement 21, 25 (1999) (explaining that, to arrest offenders, victims could enlist the \"aid of the local watchman, justice of\nthe peace, or constable for whose assistance the victim paid\").\n\n81 See, e.g., Mike McConville & Chester Mirsky, Jury Trials and Plea Bargaining: A True History 25-42 (2005) (describing early systems in\nNew York of judicial or gubernatorial appointment of prosecutors, until the office first became elective in 1847); Allen Steinberg, The\nTransformation of Criminal Justice: Philadelphia, 1800-1880, at 152-58 (1989) (stating that Philadelphia first elected its district attorney in\n1850). Prosecutors as well as judges became elected positions in many states as part of a wave of state constitutional reform in the mid-\nnineteenth century. See, e.g., Ind. Const. art. 7, § 11 (1851); Md. Const. art. 5 (1851); see also id. art. 3 (forbidding creation of state attorney\ngeneral office); Mich. Const. arts. 8, 10 (1850); N.Y. Const. art. 10 (1846); N.C. Const. art. 4, § 29 (1868); Va. Const. art. 6,§§6, 8, 30\n(1851).\n\n82 See Jacoby, supra note 70, at 6 (arguing that American prosecutors evolved from weak to strong figures largely because they were\npopularly elected and tied to local government organization). Public and private prosecutors coexisted for a few decades in some places. See\nCantrell v. Commonwealth, 329 S.E.2d 22, 25 (Va. 1985) (describing the history of private prosecution in Virginia); State v. Stein, 30 S.C.L.\n(1 Rich.) 189, 190 (S.C. 1845) (affirming that private individuals may file criminal or civil actions for the same offense but must elect the\nform before trial); Corley v. Williams, 17 S.C.L. (1 Bail.) 588, 588-89 (S.C. 1830) (providing an example of private prosecution).\nPennsylvania and New York relied heavily on private prosecutors for criminal law enforcement before 1850. See Stewart v. Sonneborn, 98\nU.S. 187, 198 (1879) (Bradley, J., dissenting) (\"Every man in the community, if he has probable cause for prosecuting another, has a perfect\nright, by law, to institute such prosecution, subject only, in the case of private prosecutions, to the penalty of paying the costs if he fails in his\n\nsuit.\"); McConville & Mirsky, supra note 81 (describing New York courts with private prosecutors and, prior to 1847, judicial or\ngubermatorial appointments of public prosecutors); Steinberg, supra note 81, at 24-69, 152-57 (describing private prosecutions, screened by\naldermen acting as magistrates, and creation of elected district attorney's office in 1852).\n\n83 Robert M.

But I sought the advice of a friend who, rather than leaving\npolitics, had just entered it. Colin Powell was now the second President Bush’s\nSecretary of State. “Why don’t you go on the lecture circuit?” he said. The short\nanswer was that it hadn’t occurred to me that I’d be any good at it. But it proved\nenergizing and interesting both for me and, it seemed, the audiences I spoke to. It\nwas also lucrative. I would deliver four lectures over the span of a week and end up\nmaking twice what, until that point in my life, I had earned during a full year. I was\nalso invited onto a number of company boards. I turned down some, in order to\navoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. But I did get involved in an area\nwhere I believed my range of experiences might be relevant: investment decisions,\nand venture capital.\n\nThe result was a dramatic change in lifestyle. Nava and I got to spend more\ntime with our daughters. We vacationed overseas for the first time. We also\ndecided to build a new home, and the place that we chose gave me my first\nexperience of how far I was from being a “private citizen” in the eyes of the Israeli\npublic. When it became known we were planning to move to Kfar Shmaryahu near\nTel Aviv, one of the wealthiest places in Israel, all hell broke loose. How could\nyou, I was asked. I couldn’t resist joking that I just wanted to be close to our\nvoters. Likud supporters were about as rare in Kfar Shmaryahu as panhandlers.\nAlong with Mishmar Hasharon, it was the only place where I'd polled over 80\npercent even in my loss to Sharon.\n\nIsrael had changed dramatically from the kibbutz-centered pioneer society of\nmy youth. Greater Tel Aviv, in particular, was thriving economically, and the\nrising crop of millionaires, whether from traditional business or in the bourgeoning\ntechnology sector, included its fair share of former kibbutznikim. Still, socially and\nculturally, a puritanical streak remained, a sense that there was something not quite\nright about people raised on a socialist ideal becoming personally well off. I\naccepted this. I recognized that I was not just a former kibbutznik. I had been head\nof the Labor Party. And Prime Minister. Still, I did feel much of the personal\ncriticism was unfair. I had devoted more than four decades of my life to serving\nmy country.

It should be as unobtrusive as possible, so that it just seems like another engaging ac-\ntivity, and the results used to tailor the teaching regimen to use different techniques to address\nweaknesses and reinforce strengths.\n\nFor example, with group building of a model car, students are tested on a variety of skills:\nprocedural understanding, visual acuity, motor acuity, creative problem solving, interpersonal\ncommunications, empathy, patience, manners, and so on. With this kind of complex, yet en-\ngaging, activity as a metric the teacher can see how each student approaches the process of\nunderstanding each subtask, and subsequently guide each student’s focus differently depending\non strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIn Tables 16.4 and 16.5 we describe some particular tasks that AGIs may be meaningfully\nassigned in the context of a general AGI Preschool design and curriculum as described above.\nOf course, this is a very partial list, and is intended as evocative rather than comprehensive.\n\nAny one of these tasks can be turned into a rigorous quantitative test, thus allowing the\nprecise comparison of different AGI systems’ capabilities; but we have chosen not to emphasize\nthis point here, partly for space reasons and partly for philosophical ones. In some contexts\nthe quantitative comparison of different systems may be the right thing to do, but as discussed\nin Chapter 17 there are also risks associated with this approach, including the emergence of\nan overly metrics-focused “bakeoff mentality” among system developers, and overfitting of AI\nabilities to test taking. What is most important is the isolation of specific tasks on which\ndifferent systems may be experientially trained and then qualitatively assessed and compared,\nrather than the evaluation of quantitative metrics.\n\nTask-oriented testing allows for feedback on applications of general pedagogical principles to\nreal-world, embodied activities. This allows for iterative refinement based learning (shaping),\nand cross development of knowledge acquisition and application (multitask learning). It also\nhelps militate against both cheating, and over-fitting, as teachers can make ad-hoc modifications\nto the tests to determine if this is happening and correct for it if necessary.\n\nE.g., consider a linguistic task in which the AGI is required to formulate a set of instruc-\ntions encapsulating a given behavior (which may include components that are physical, social,\nlinguistic, etc.). Note that although this is presented as centrally a linguistic task, it actually in-\nvolves a diverse set of competencies since the behavior to be described may encompass multiple\nreal-world aspects.\n\nTo turn this task into a more thorough test one might involve a number of human teachers\nand a number of human students. Before the test, an ensemble of copies of the AGI would\nbe created, with identical knowledge state. Each copy would interact with a different human\nteacher, who would demonstrate to it a certain behavior. After testing the AGI on its own\nknowledge of the material, the teacher would then inform the AGI that it will then be tested on\nits ability to verbally describe this behavior to another. Then, the teacher goes away and the\ncopy interacts with a series of students, attempting to convey to the students the instructions\ngiven by the teacher.\n\nThe teacher can thereby assess both the AGI’s understanding of the material, and the ability\nto explain it to the other students. This separates out assessment of understanding from assess-\nment of ability to communicate understanding, attempting to avoid conflation of one with the\nother. The design of the training and testing needs to account for potential\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013211\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

On the other hand, history has taught me not to fall for it when\nRichard seems unexpectedly vulnerable.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said. I kept my tone light-hearted, friendly. \"You know I love you, right?\"\n\"Do I?\" Richard asked.\n\nI tilted my head at him. Without thinking, I kissed my own fingers, then put my hand\ngently against his face, as if I were about to stroke his cheek. Or slap him. I guess it was a\nway of distancing myself and kissing him at the same time. I think he understood that I\nintended it as an uncertain-but-intimate gesture. But I'm never sure, with Richard.\n\n\"Call me,” I said.\n\"No,\" Richard said. \"You call me.”\n\nHours later, Mr. Ambition brought him up. We were having one of those sweet, intimate,\ndisjointed bedtime conversations. Mr. Ambition was lying back, half-covered by a sheet,\nand I was admiring the play of light on his chest. \"Richard really cares about you,\" he\nsaid.\n\nI stiffened, and sat up. \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But I can't trust Richard.\"\n\"His tone seemed wistful, when he saw you.\"\n\n\"I can't trust Richard,\" I repeated. \"It's always a game with him. Sometimes I think that\nwe have a real emotional connection, but if I try to talk about it or give him emotional\nfeedback, he just ignores me.\"\n\n\"Maybe he isn't really ignoring you,” argued Mr. Ambition. \"Maybe every time you say\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018624\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Our relatively common computers these\ndays have 32 or 64 bit processors. If these 0,1 choices are made in a random\nsequence in which each step is independent of the previous one, the sequential\nprobabilities, _, are multiplicative: e.g. the probability of getting two 1’s (heads\nin a fair coin) in a row are the product of each 0.5 probability: p,;=0.5 x p2=0.5 =\nP1 P2 = 0.25.

The many visitors to the temple stopped and took photos of\nthe passing bride and groom, no other foreigners had ever been married\nthere and certainly anyone wearing traditional western wedding attire,\nsuch a sight had never been seen behind these religious walls, we became\na permanent icon at the temple. The ceremony was done in the Buddhist\ncustoms according to their ancestral accordance, and translated for us in\nour own language. Both Robbie and I were anointed with a blessing from\nthe monk with a splash of water and seven sacramental bracelets, each\none representing another meaning to the longevity of our union together.\nWe signed our names in the Buddhist wedding registry of Doi Cept\nTemple and officially became Mr. & Mrs. Roberts at least officially in\nour hearts knowing the laws of Australia only recognize certified\nweddings, meaning when we got back to his homeland we’d have to\nmake a run for the courthouse. This was our real wedding though, perfect\ndown to every detail. Walking up to the highest point of the temple to the\nbalcony hanging over the edge of a cliff side over looking the city of\nChang-Mai, we knew we had found the perfect spot to recite our vows of\nlove to each other. Providing everything for me and more than I could\never ask for, his vows were to love me unconditionally until death do we\npart, shelter me from all the cruelty in the world that I was so accustomed\ntoo and to be like the bear, because the bear never forgets. Tears once\nagain streamed down from my eyes as he made this moment\nunforgettable. Wiping the mascara fading undermeath my eyelids whilst\ngiggling at my embarrassment | took his hands back into mine again and\ngave him the vows that were the sacred prepared words from my heart.\nMy ears were thundering the sound of a million horses hoofs descending\ndownhill and my heart was beating so fast my words barely trembled out\nof my mouth when I began to tell him how much he had changed my\n\n129\n\nJ Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL.\n\nwhole life around and how I would dedicate my entire being to loving\nhim and only him until | blew my final breath.\n\nI meant every word that I said to him, this was it for me, wanting\nnothing more out of life than to be with someone like him to raise a few\nkids together and grow old on the front porch letting the days fade us by.\nI know it probably sounds boring to most and it would’ve to me as well\nmany years ago but after the life | had led, I had enough experience in the\nreal world for my liking and now all I want to do is to enjoy the\nremaining days of my life for what it is...a simple and satisfying\nexistence. Our day was so special but not only to us, even too the Monk\nthat married us. Upon our descent down the lifts he asked if he could take\na photo with the bride and groom in front of their symbolic liberty bell\nsignifying the union between east and west. It represented a lot for us too,\nit was the commencement of a new life together and just the beginning of\nbattling each other’s past demons together.\n\nKissing the bridal party goodbye, who were just the local girls I had\nmet on some of our many nights out of having fun. | threw my arranged\nbouquet of Thailand’s white wedding floras mixed with colorful orchids\nto the screaming Thai women behind me and we were given one last\ntradition to take with us, the release of caged doves. It was such an\nincredible gesture, especially for me. Symbolizing their freedom as well\nas mine I opened the cage’s door to let them free to decide our own fates.\nAs the wings on the birds began to spread open and they took their final\ndecent into the blue skies granting themselves freedom | knew mine had\nfinally come too. The relevance of watching them fly away and how I had\nperceived my own day of marriage related to the identical feeling of\nfleeing an entrapment of my own kind. | was liberated from the bounds of\nslavery I had come to know over the many years I had spent with my fair\nshare of greedy perverted old men only to have serendipity mend my\nscars with the powerful healing of what true love has to endeavor on.\n\nAs customary in the romance novels I had read as a young girl he\npicked me up in the hallway before our hotel suite and carried me over\nthe threshold, poufy dress and all. My arms were tightly squeezed around\nhis neck never once taking my eyes off of him until he revealed yet\nanother sweet surprise. Besides the cleaners tiding up my room while we\nwere gone they were also given instructions by none other than the groom\nhimself to pick the petals off the stems of red roses to place on our bed in\nthe shape of a giant heart. The rose petals led the way to where we\nconsummated our love physically and it was undeniably the first time in\nmy life I had really ever been made love too. Hours had passed by before\nwe thought about anything else besides one another’s words of arousal,\ntantalizing touches, and lingering kisses.

Since the negotiations with the Palestinians were stuck in\nneutral, I was under increasing pressure from within Labor to pull out of Bibi’s\ngovernment. What on earth was the point of staying, they asked. All I was doing,\nfrom their perspective, was giving Bibi political cover for abandoning any serious\neffort to get a peace agreement. Their argument was entirely reasonable. My\nfrustration was that, due to the need for military secrecy, the counter-argument was\nimpossible for me to make: that I felt I had a responsibility to stay at a time when\nthere remained a real possibility Israel might need to take military action against\nIran. To a mix of consternation and anger among many Labor colleagues, I ended\nup taking what seemed to me the only realistic option. In January 2011, I left the\nLabor Party. With three other of our ministers in the government — who were, of\ncourse, aware of the ongoing Iran discussions — I set up a new “centrist, Zionist”\nparty called Ha’Atzmaut, or Independence. We remained in Bibi’s government.\n\nMy main focus was now on the Americans. In order to secure the “international\nlegitimacy” any Israeli attack required, we had to win at least their understanding\nthat we might feel it necessary to act. Fortunately, I had built up a good\nrelationship with the key figures in the Obama administration. That had not always\nbeen easy, given the tension between the Americans and Bibi. That wasn’t just\nbecause of the deadlock in the peace process, still a priority for President Obama.\nThere were other complications. Ever since the initial pressure for a settlement\nfreeze, right-wing politicians and commentators, and Bibi himself, had taken to\nportraying President Obama as fundamentally unsympathetic to Israel. After the\nRepublicans’ victory in the mid-term Congressional elections in November 2010,\nBibi went a step further. He began cozying up to congressmen and senators on the\nother side of the aisle. This overt meddling in the internal politics of our closest\nally was not just a breach of longstanding tradition, but of common sense.\nMembers of the Administration began privately calling Bibi “the Republican\nsenator from Rechavia” — a reference to the Jerusalem neighborhood where the\nPrime Minister’s residence was located.\n\n420\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028268\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

What nation does conduct the confident, creative, energetic an global\nnegotiations of the sort that mark a power with a clear sense of direction?\n\nTaken as a whole, these six paradoxes represent nothing less than the potential\nunbuckling of the greatest power the world has ever seen. And because the whole\nworld is connected to that power, still more of the system may yet be rattled apart.\nWe are surrounded today not only by fish, but enmeshed in a world of connective\nlinks that are the tissue of our real power - and a source of danger. A sense of\ndirection. You have to feel as you look at this rotten, dangerous landscape we've\nmade for ourselves in recent years. We need a sense of direction.\n\n6.\n\nIn response to these challenges, America’s leading figures are now proposing a\nrange of ideas that don’t honestly resonate with much confidence. Really they are\nhaving a debate about if they should use more of the old style of power or less. What\nthey aren’t doing is grasping the nature of the age. So no clear, imaginative and\ncoherent picture of where we might head yet exists. In fact, as you're probably\nstarting to suspect, the very best ideas of our incumbent figures may yet make the\nworld more dangerous, may firmly and enthusiastically pull us into connective webs\nof danger and waste and mis-calculation they don't see. With our Seventh Sense\nwe'll be able to spot and think about many of these dangers in a new, better and\nmore rational way, free from the blinders of habit, but we should know what the\nworld looks like to the blind.\n\nTwo approaches are predominant among the most respected American elites, who -\nas leaders of the leaders of the establishment represent an important group for us as\n\n47\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018279\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Two days in, in fact, I told a television interviewer that the\ngovernment had every right to respond and was doing so effectively. Olmert\nphoned to thank me. When he, like Shimon, asked what I thought the government\nshould do next, I was straightforward: “Do your best to bring things to an end as\nsoon as you can.” I said that Halutz and the other generals would be caught up in\nthe operational details, which made his role and that of the cabinet even more\ncritical. “In any operation, you’ll have an idea about what represents a satisfactory\nexit point. But there will be a temptation, when you get close to that point, to take\njust one more step, to keep going until you’re absolutely sure you’ve reached it.”\nResist that temptation, I told him. I said there was a danger that, before they knew\nit, he and the other minister would be in way over their heads.\n\nIn pure military terms, there were just two realistic choices in responding the\nHibzollah attack: a deliberately limited and fairly brief operation, or a full-scale\nwar. We ended up doing neither. The result was an operation that lasted 34 days,\nnearly twice the length of the Yom Kippur War. Our air force flew 12,000\nmissions, more than in 1973 and nearly twice as many as in the 1982 Lebanon\nWar. Hizbollah fired about 4,000 rockets into Israel — from a stockpile we\nestimated to number nearly 20,000 — and not just at the border settlements but as\nfar south as Hadera and Haifa, keeping hundreds of thousands of Israelis under\neffective siege. More than 120 Israeli soldiers and 44 civilians were killed. So were\nhundreds of Hizbollah fighters and, inevitably, many Lebanese civilians as well,\nwith a predictable surge of criticism from much of the outside world. Only\nPresident Bush and Britain’s Tony Blair steadfastly reminded the critics of how the\nwar had actually begun.\n\nThe one putative victory for Israel was the UN cease-fire resolution that Tzipi\nLivni helped to negotiate in August. At least on paper, it contained a commitment\nto a “long-term solution” including the disarmament of Hizbollah and the\n“unconditional release of the abducted Israeli soldiers, which has given rise to the\ncurrent crisis.” But as Israeli newspapers began speaking to the returning soldiers\nand officers, a picture emerged not just of a long and difficult war, but a lack of\nclearly communicated military objectives, and an often-chaotic chain of command,\nwhich ended up costing Israeli lives. Our final advance, alone, shortly before the\ncease-fire, claimed the lives of some 30 soldiers. And for what, many Israelis were\nsoon asking themselves.

But it is not illegal \nfor White House officials to use private email accounts as long as they forward work-related \nmessages to their work accounts so they can be preserved. \nDuring the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Trump repeatedly harped on Hillary Clinton's use of a \nprivate account as secretary of state, making it a centerpiece of his campaign and using it to \npaint her as untrustworthy. \"We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval \nOffice,\" Mr. Trump said last year.

We actually prefer to separate this into two topics: environments and methods for careful\nqualitative evaluation of AGI systems, versus metrics for precise measurement of AGI systems.\nThe difficulty of formulating bulletproof metrics for partial progress toward advanced AGI\nhas become evident throughout the field, and in Chapter 8 we have elaborated one plausible\nexplanation for this phenomenon, the \"trickiness\" of cognitive synergy. [LW MLO09], summarizing\na workshop on “Evaluation and Metrics for Human-Level AT’ held in 2008, discusses some of\nthe general difficulties involved in this type of assessment, and some requirements that any\nviable approach must fulfill, On the other hand, the lack of appropriate methods for careful\nqualitative evaluation of AGI systems has been much less discussed, but we consider it actually\na more important issue — as well as an easier (though not easy) one to solve.\n\nWe haven’t actually found the lack of quantitative intelligence metrics to be a major obstacle\nin our practical AGI work so far. Our OpenCogPrime implementation lags far behind the\nCogPrime design as articulated in Part 2 of this book, and according to the theory underlying\nCogPrime, the more interesting behaviors and dynamics of the system will occur only when all\nthe parts of the system have been engineered to a reasonable level of completion and integrated\ntogether. So, the lack of a great set of metrics for evaluating the intelligence of our partially-\nbuilt system hasn’t impaired too much. Testing the intelligence of the current OpenCogPrime\nsystem is a bit like testing the flight capability of a partly-built airplane that only has stubs\nfor wings, lacks tail-fins, has a much less efficient engine than the one that’s been designed for\nuse in the first \"real\" version of the airplane, etc. There may be something to be learned from\nsuch preliminary tests, but making them highly rigorous isn’t a great use of effort, compared\nto working on finishing implementing the design according to the underlying theory.\n\nOn the other hand, the problem of what environments and methods to use to qualitatively\nevaluate and study AGI progress, has been considerably more vexing to us in practice, as\nwe've proceeded in our work on implementing and testing OpenCogPrime and developing the\nCogPrime theory. When developing a complex system, it’s nearly always valuable to see what\nthis system does in some fairly rich, complex situations, in order to gain a better intuitive\nunderstanding of the parts and how they work together. In the context of human-level AGI, the\ntheoretically best way to do this would be to embody one’s AGI system in a humanlike body\n\n289\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013205\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

They need to hold votes to vali-\ndate their rule, but they also recognize the risk involved,\nas elections remain a potent instrument of democratic\nrenewal even in deeply troubled societies.\n\nThe events of late 2014 and 2015 include vivid re-\nminders of the power of the ballot. In Nigeria, Africa's\nmost populous country and largest economy, voters\nwho were fed up with governmental complacency,\nterrorism, and graft rejected the incumbent presicent,\nGoodluck Jonathan, and elected Muhammadu Buhari\nto replace him. In Myanmar, a huge turnout produced\nan overwhelming victory in parliamentary elections for\nlongtime opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her\nNational League for Democracy (NLD), a remarkable\nturnaround in a country that until recently ranked\namong the world’s most repressive.\n\nVoters in Sri Lanka ousted their increasingly author-\nitarian and divisive president, Mahinda Rajapaksa,\n\nin favor of Maithripala Sirisena. Upon taking office,\nSirisena immediately overturned some of Rajapaksa’s\nrepressive policies and began repairing relations with\nboth the country’s Tamil minority and the international\ncommunity. And in Argentina, opposition candidate\nMauricio Macri won the presidency by defeating the\nnominee of incumbent Cristina Fernandez de Kirch-\nner, who with her late husband, Néstor Kirchner, had\ndominated the executive branch for over a decade.\nCombined with a victory for the democratic opposi-\ntion in Venezuela's parliamentary elections, Macri’s\nvictory may have been the beginning of a rollback of\n\nLatin America’s populist movements, which had previ-\nously made impressive gains across the region.\n\nVoters in these countries retained faith in the democrat-\nic process even after experiencing hardship after hard-\nship, including military rule (Myanmapn), civil war and au-\nthoritarian rule (Sri Lanka), a terrorist scourge (Nigeria),\neconomic collapse and political repression (Venezuela),\nand economic setback and unaccountable government\n(Argentina). They prevailed despite, in some cases, an\nelectoral playing field tilted sharply against the opposi-\ntion; in other cases, a history of political violence; and in\nstill other cases, apprehensions about what lies ahead\nwhen dictatorships give way to normal politics.\n\nSome of these voters were also rejecting political\nfigures who had publicly disdained the world’s democ-\nracies and drawn closer to authoritarian powers like\nRussia, China, and Iran. They were willing to listen to\ncandidates who talked about the rule of law, freedom\nof expression, and the right to be free of payoffs and\nbribes, and they were unimpressed by those who\nblamed every step backward on foreign plots.\n\nThere will always be dictators and would-be leaders\nfor life who grow overconfident, lose touch with the\nmood of their people, and fail to do what it takes to\nensure victory at the polls, as apparently occurred in\nThe Gambia in late 2016. But the rest can be expected\nto learn from such mistakes and invest the necessary\n\nresources in a false mockery of democratic suffrage.\n\n1.

Moreover, the formal model, as will be\nseen, helps explicate when CWOL will occur as well as what difference the ability to not\nlook and to observe others not looking will make.\n\nWe formalize this idea using what we call the envelope game (see figure 1). The\nenvelope game distills an interaction between two individuals, or players, in an uncertain\nenvironment. Thus, we start by assuming there is a distribution of payoffs with two\npossibilities: one in which defection is relatively tempting, and another in which it is\nnot. The temptation to defect is randomly determined. Defection is not tempting with\nprobability p and tempting with probability 1—p. Both players know how likely it is that\ndefection is tempting. However, at this point, neither player knows size of the temptation.\nThat is, the temptation is placed inside an envelope and the envelope is sealed without\nthe players knowing its content. Next, we assume that one of the players, player 1,\nchooses whether to learn the size of the temptation, either via mental deliberation or by\ngathering information. We model this in a simplified way by assuming that player 1 has a\ndichotomous choice: she can choose to open the envelope and look inside it, or not. If she\nopens the envelope and looks, she learns the size of the temptation. If she does not open\nthe envelope and look, she only knows the distribution of payoffs. Player 1 then chooses\n\nwhether to cooperate or defect. We model cooperation as costly to player 1, regardless\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026523\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

All are mechanisms to guard against unjustified nonenforcement,\nor underenforcement, by jurisdictions’ primary prosecution agencies. The next Part examines the relative strengths of these\nalternatives.\n\nIll. PROS AND CONS OF FEDERALISM-BASED ENFORCEMENT REDUNDANCY\nA. Comparative Limits of Enforcement-Oversight Strategies\n\nEach of the institutional approaches to reducing underenforcement of criminal law by public prosecutors has comparative\nstrengths and weaknesses. All three share the common virtue of being a means to reduce instances of bias, favoritism, or other\nmisjudgments that result in unjustified nonenforcement. All three enable outside reevaluation of declination decisions. Private\nprosecution empowers motivated private parties - crime victims - to initiate the challenge to a public prosecutor's decision not\nto charge by filing charges themselves. The same is true in jurisdictions that subject declination decisions to formal\nadministrative or judicial review; victims trigger that process by petitioning for an independent evaluation. Both of those\npractices harness the motivations of interested private parties to, in effect, screen which declination decisions should be subject\nto reassessment, although private prosecution poses a significant cost barrier for victims who want to take advantage of it. At\nthe same time, both of these practices give public officials the final [*890] word on whether a prosecution (public or private)\nwill proceed.\n\nThe federalism route to prosecutorial oversight, by contrast, gives private parties no formal role, although victims can file\ncomplaints and lobby federal prosecutors just as they can with local police and prosecutors for any alleged crime. Put\ndifferently, federal prosecution as check on state underenforcement rests more directly on the mitiative, diligence, and\njudgment of federal prosecutors than private victims. In some areas, federal commitment is significant. !45 But it also varies\nwith the policy priorities of presidential administrations, which can vary considerably in their commitment to fighting certain\n\nkinds of crimes and to federal oversight of state criminal justice administration. !4°\n\n106 The U.K. is scheduled to leave the European Union in 2019.

In a state\nlike Russia, China, or Iran, the authorities already have\nample latitude to deregister and ban any organiza-\ntion, and to prevent foreign organizations from doing\n\nbusiness with domestic partners. A legal system that\nis flexible enough to serve the evolving needs of the\nregime and target virtually any adversary is a hallmark\nof modern authoritarianism. But the NGO measures\ngive an added veneer of legality to what is essentially\narbitrary rule.\n\nThe repeated adoption of new laws also gives the\nleadership the opportunity to showcase emotional\npropaganda that stresses the subversive nature of\nforeign or independent domestic civil society orga-\nnizations, reinforcing the idea that the motherland\nis threatened by hostile encirclement and political\ninfiltration.\n\nForeign agents\n\nn 2012, Russia adopted the so-called foreign agents\nlaw. It requires NGOs that receive foreign funding and\nengage in what the authorities define as political work\nto register as “foreign agents,” a term that, in Russian,\nis synonymous with foreign spy. Subsequent amend-\nments allow the Justice Ministry to register groups as\nforeign agents without their consent. As with many\n\nother Russian laws, the standards for enforcement are\nentirely political. The designation is applied princi-\npally to NGOs that seek political reforms or criticize\nthe Kremlin's antidemocratic direction, though the\n\nauthorities’ reasoning in many cases is difficult to\nfathom. State-friendly organizations have generally\nbeen left alone.\n\nemorial, the human rights organization founded\n\nto carry forward the ideals associated with Andrey\nSakharov, was one of the first groups to be unilaterally\nregistered as a foreign agent by the Justice Ministry\n\nin 2014. In 2015, the ministry accused Memorial of\n“undermining the foundations of constitutional order”\nby describing the Russian invasion of Ukraine as\naggression and by asserting, correctly, that active duty\nRussian troops were taking part in the conflict.\n\nAs in most countries, including some democracies,\ncivil society organizations in authoritarian climates\nare largely funded by governmental or foreign entities.\nThere is little tradition of private philanthropic funding\n\nfor NGOs, and even if there were, few wealthy Rus-\nsians or Iranians would risk reprisal from the authori-\nties by donating to regime critics. Consequently, orga-\nnizations that lose access to foreign funding typically\nhave no domestic alternative and must curtail their\noperations or give up their political independence.\n\nIn Russia, even NGOs with politically anodyne mis-\nsions have been targeted as foreign agents, as the\nregime seeks to deter any civil society activity that\ncould challenge official policies or foster international\nties without state approval. One such organization\nwas the Northern Nature Coalition, which protects\nold-growth forests and had protested certain cdevel-\nopment projects. Another was Young Karelia, which\nsponsors puppet shows for children in Karelian—a\nlanguage closely related to that spoken in neighboring\nFinland. The latter group was declared a foreign agent\nin part because of a $10,000 grant from the United\nNations.”\n\nThe undesirables\n\nOnce it was the CIA that dictatorships reflexively\nblamed when under pressure. More recently, the tar-\nget of attack is a group of prodemocracy foundations,\nmostly American, that encourage political reform\nthrough nonviolent methods. According to the de-\nnunciations of officials from Russia, China, Venezuela,\nand other repressive states, the National Endowment\nfor Democracy and the organizations associated with\nphilanthropist George Soros present a danger to the\nstatus quo that rivals NATO or Western intelligence\nagencies.°\n\nIn 2015, Putin signed a law that allowed the prosecu-\ntor general to declare foreign organizations “unde-\nsirable\" if they are deemed to pose a threat to the\ncountry's security, defense capability, or public order.\nThe measure empowered the authorities to shut such\nentities’ offices in Russia, ban Russian groups from\nworking with them, and freeze their assets.\n\nWhile the law has been used to expel foreign prode-\nmocracy organizations, the real targets are Russian\ncitizens. This is made clear by a section of the law\nthat calls for heavy fines and jail terms of up to six\nyears for Russians who collaborate with organizations\non the undesirable list. Conceivably, a Russia human\nrights advocate who attends a seminar in Poland or\nGermany sponsored by the International Republi-\ncan Institute—one of the groups added to the list in\n2016—could be prosecuted once back in Russia.'*\n\n26\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019260\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The authors thank Douglas Beloof,\nPatricia Cassell, Meg Garvin, Jay Howell, James Marsh, and Stephen Twist for their assistance with this Article.\n\nHighlight\n\nThis Article addresses whether crime victims should have rights during criminal investigations, using the Crime Victims’\nRights Act (CVRA) as the focal point for our discussion. This is a critical issue, as many criminal cases may never proceed to\nformal charging. If crime victims have no rights during criminal investigations, then many crime victims will never have any\nrights at all.\n\nThe issue of whether crime victims have rights in the criminal justice process recently came to a head when the Justice\nDepartment released a memorandum contending that the CVRA does not extend crime victims any rights until prosecutors\nchoose to file formal criminal charges. This led the CVRA's Senate cosponsor, then-Senator Jon Kyl, to fire off an angry letter\nto the Justice Department attacking its position. In our Article, we side with the Act's cosponsor. We believe that, properly\nunderstood, the CVRA does extend crime victims’ rights during criminal investigations.\n\nOur Article proceeds in four parts. First, it highlights the importance of applying the Act before the formal filing of charges by\nillustrating how dozens of victims in a notorious federal sex abuse case were deprived of the ability to participate meaningfully\nin the criminal process when federal prosecutors narrowly interpreted their responsibilities under the Act. Second, the Article\nreviews the purpose, text, structure, and history of the CVRA, concluding that they all support the conclusion that crime victims\nhave rights during criminal investigations. Third, our Article critiques the Department's memorandum, demonstrating that the\nDepartment's analysis is unpersuasive. Fourth and finally, the Article provides a specific approach for determining when rights\nshould attach - specifically when federal law enforcement agencies have identified a crime with sufficient precision to send a\n\"target\" letter to a criminal defendant. We also observe that federal and state prosecutors have already accorded rights to\nvictims before formally filing charges, which further undermines the Department's overly narrow construction of the Act.\n\nText\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017604\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The TSX is one of the world’s largest stock exchanges and, similar to Nasdaq and the NYSE,\nhas stringent listing, trading and corporate governance requirements. The TSXV focuses on companies\nwith small market capitalization and has less stringent listing requirements than the TSX. The CSE is\nfocused on micro capitalization and emerging growth companies, and it has the least stringent listing\nrequirements of the primary Canadian exchanges. In order to be listed on either the TSX or the TSXV,\na company is required to be in compliance with Canada’s Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes\nRegulations (ACMPR) and all applicable laws in jurisdictions within which it operates. (Operations\nof listed companies are restricted in jurisdictions, such as the United States, where cannabis is federally\nprohibited.) Unlike the TSX and TSXV, the CSE has allowed companies listed on its exchange to invest\nin, acquire and otherwise operate cannabis-related businesses in the United States.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the cannabis-related companies traded on U.S., Cana-\ndian and Australian stock markets.

But to your dying day, you won’t\nbe able to look yourself in the mirror and explain why you waited for another 630\nIsraelis to die first.”\n\nHe did eventually start building it, but only in the wake of an act of terrorism\nwhich, even by the standards of this new and still-escalating intifada, was truly\nobscene. In March 2002, suicide bombers murdered 30 people, mostly elderly, as\nthey were celebrating the annual Passover Seder in a hotel dining room in Netanya.\nArik hit back two days later with Israel’s largest military operation on the West\nBank since 1967. Israeli forces retook major Palestinian towns, placed Arafat\nunder de facto siege in his headquarters in Ramallah and imposed curfews and\nclosures. In June, the government formally approved the security fence. Still,\nanother year would pass before the major part of the barrier was in place, by which\ntime some 500 Israelis had been murdered in the terror attacks. Only then did the\nnumber of casualties begin to fall.\n\nI tried to steer clear of public criticism of Arik’s government. One of the lessons\nI’d learned as Prime Minister was how easy it was to second-guess from the\noutside. No Prime Minister can act exactly as he might plan or want to. The most\nyou can do is make sure you understand and analyze the issues and follow your\ninstincts, experience and conscience to come as near as possible to doing what you\nbelieve is right. You will inevitably make mistakes and misjudgements. I certainly\ndid. At least some of the criticism I received was deserved. I was at times too\ninflexible. I tended to limit my focus to a small group of trusted aides and advisors.\nI was less good at schmoozing with — or, perhaps more importantly, delegating to —\nothers in the government or the party. I suspect it’s no coincidence that the man\nwho brought me into government in the first place was often criticized for the same\nthings. By character, instinct and experience, Rabin, too, remained less a politician\nthan a military man. Yet towards the end of his second period as Prime Minister,\nhe did get better at delegating to people around him, and creating an atmosphere\nthat encouraged teamwork, even when he knew he could not accept or act on\neverything they might suggest. During my term as Prime Minister, I was much less\ngood at that.\n\nBut another thing Yitzhak and I shared was a determination to set ourselves\nspecific goals and do everything we could to achieve them. I promised to get the\narmy out of Lebanon. With the Palestinians, I arrived in office convinced that the\nprocess begun in Oslo was both a huge opportunity and a potential dead-end.

I had to, with\nevery single class, say something original, teach something original that had never been written or\nsaid before by anybody. That was my aspiration, and I worked hard to achieve it. Law, of\ncourse, was based on precedent: you got points for showing that someone, particularly a judge,\nhad said earlier what you are saying now. I hated that approach. It reminded me of my Yeshiva\neducation. I wanted to be original. Every single class had to have something new. I knew the\nstudents wouldn’t appreciate it because they didn’t know it had never been said by anybody, but\nthat was my way of satisfying myself. And I would rip up the notes at the end of the year and I'd\nsay, we have to start from scratch all over again. I was a very energetic teacher and I really tried\nto put everything I had into each class.\n\nI introduced a lot philosophy and psychology into the classroom, and because I was teaching\ncriminal law. I had a lot of freedom since no one really cared about criminal law at Harvard. Our\nstudents were unlikely to become criminal lawyers in those days. In fact, I started out one of my\nclasses by saying, “statistically, more of you are going to be criminal defendants than criminal\nlawyers, so pay attention.” My first year of “crim” class was kind of a course designed to stretch\nthe mind and teach analytic skills because it was not regarded as a “bread and butter” course like\ncorporations or tax. So I had a lot of flexibility in what I could teach.\n\nA few years after I became a full professor, Derek Bok became the Dean of the Law School. We\nnever got along all that well. One day he called me into his office with a smile on his face and told\nme that I was a very expensive professor. Since salaries are fairly standard at Harvard, I didn’t\nknow what he was talking about. He pulled out a letter from a Harvard alum saying that he\nwould make a very considerable donation to Harvard Law School on one condition, namely, that\nI was fired. Many of the old-fashioned alumni were upset by my liberalism and the fact that I was\nteaching subjects like Psychiatry and Law, in addition to traditional subjects such as Criminal\nLaw, but this particular alum had a more personal grievance. I had represented, on a pro bono\nbasis, a young man I had grown up with in Brooklyn, who had been accused of making a bomb\nfor the Jewish Defense League that had caused the death of a young woman employee of Sol\nHurok. The young woman, as it turned out, was the sister-in-law of this wealthy alumnus. He\nwould not contribute a single penny to Harvard Law as long as I remained on the faculty, but if I\nwere fired he would donate a large building worth millions of dollars. In jest, I suggested to\nDerek Bok that maybe we could make a deal for a significant severance package. We both\nlaughed. He knew that a great university like Harvard could never be intimidated, by the threat of\nwithholding any amount of money, into firing a tenured professor.\n\nIn my second semester of teaching, I was assigned the class in family law, which was an advanced\nelective popular with women students, because women lawyers were thought suitable to practice\nin such “soft” areas of law as divorce and child custody. My class included some of the most\nprominent women graduates of that era, including Lydy Dole, who became a United States\nSenator, Elizabeth Holtzman, who became a member of Congress and the District Attorney of\nBrooklyn, Elizabeth Bartholet, who is a professor at Harvard Law School and several other\nprominent figures.\n\n7S\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017162\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He wrote in his post, “Psych\nproblems = dishonorable discharge depending on how much they\nhate you. Lots of alleged homos were in the hold unit, too, but they\nonly got a general discharge at best.”\n\nIf he had broken his legs, it was not evident to Joyce Kinsey, his\nnext-door neighbor, who told me that she never saw Snowden on\ncrutches when he returned to his mother’s condominium in Sep-\ntember 2004.

But what then, I asked. Unless we were prepared to\nresume open-ended Israeli control, we’d be left with no one to run Gaza\nafterwards. The obvious candidate, Egypt, was even less interested than we were in\nassuming responsibility for the more than one-and-a-half million Palestinians who\nlived there. I doubted that even Arafat would have been ready to do so. But\nrelations had only worsened, since his death in 2004, between the Fatah old guard\nin the Palestinian Authority on the West Bank and the Hamas overlords in Gaza. I\ndoubted very much that Abu Mazen would want to get involved. I did send an aide\nto see him to ask whether, in principle, he was open to reassuming control of Gaza\nfollowing an Israeli takeover. His answer was unsurprising and unequivocal: no.\n\nI secured cabinet support for the more limited aim of restoring a period of calm\nfor Israeli citizens in the south. I said the military operation had to be as sharp and\nshort as possible, and end with some kind of political understanding that the\nrockets would stop for a significant period of time. The final plan was presented to\nministers a few days before the operation. It would begin with surprise air strikes\nand a naval bombardment, followed by a limited ground incursion to hit remaining\nHamas targets outside of the major refugee camps, which I was determined to\navoid. The whole operation was intended to last for two weeks at the most.\nHopefully, closer to a week, with diplomatic efforts through Egypt to secure a\nlasting cease-fire and, ideally, prevent Hamas from resupplying its rocket\nstockpiles through its smuggling tunnels from the Sinai.\n\nWhen we launched Operation Cast Lead on the morning of December 27,\nnearly all the Hamas forces were where we’d expected them to be. Two waves of\nair strikes, with over a hundred jets and attack helicopters, killed 350 Hamas\nfighters. We destroyed Hamas’s headquarters and dozens of its government and\npolice installations. The attacks continued in the days that followed. We took a\nrange of actions designed to minimize civilian casualties. We dropped leaflets\nbefore bombing sorties, phoned residents, and fired light missiles before heavier\nordnance was used. Still, I realized that civilian casualties were unavoidable — if\nonly because Hamas, like Hizbollah in Lebanon, was deliberately firing its rockets\nfrom civilian areas, sometimes even near schools or hospitals. Civilian casualties\nwere obviously tragic in themselves. They also made it inevitable that the longer\nthe operation went on, the more likely we were to face international criticism, and\ndiplomatic pressure to bring it to an end. That was an additional reason I had\ninsisted that the operation be well defined and time-limited.\n\n406\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028254\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Peggy Siegal takes us behind the scenes where she got herself on camera along with a few of her\nfamous friends. Nice work if you can get it.\n\nIn 1987, right after director Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for \"Platoon,” he immediately turned to a\ndomestic arena and began working on \"Wall Street\" in New York City where his father had been a\nstockbroker. Although the film was widely seen as a scathing critique of the culture of Wall Street, Stone has\nsaid that part of the film is a defense of capitalism, his father's vision of finance (as seen through the Hal\nHolbrook character) and an homage to his father.\n\nAt the time Oliver was also fascinated with the connection between the psyche of Latino Miami drug dealers\nfrom his earlier \"Scarface\" script and the American-born 28- to 35-year-old, white collar stockbrokers. Both\ngroups had an animalistic need to obtain big and fast money. They shared an obsession with corruption and\ngreed.\n\nOliver sent his actors to Bear Stearns for research, including then-newcomer Charlie Sheen, who played Bud\nFox, a kid from nowhere. When he learns to cold call, and lands one big client, Gordon Gekko, Fox is thrust\ninto the fast lane with a rock star financial mentor who teaches him corruption.\n\nOliver needed an old-fashioned villain to create drama, and he cast Michael Douglas as Gekko against type.\nMichael was not known as a heavy at the time, but as a charming, handsome, sensitive leading man. Oliver\nalso saw the anger, confidence, salesmanship and style that Michael brought to the role. Michael's Gekko\nlooked a bit like Laker's coach Pat Riley with his slicked back hair and well-cut suits, and it became Michael’s\nmost important role, winning him the Academy Award for the villain no one could ever forget.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021235\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I will describe how the First Amendment\nhas changed over the half century I have been litigating freedom of expression cases. In some\ninstances, these exceptions have been narrowed, while in others they have been expanded. I will\nbegin by exploring the roots and rationality of the “mother” of all exceptions to the First\nAmendment: “Falsely shouting fire in a theater.” This metaphor has been invoked to justify\ncensorship in nearly all of my cases: pornography, revealing state secrets, defamation, ridicule,\nincitement and fighting words. Those advocating censorship generally argue that these exceptions\n“are just like shouting fire in a theater.” It is important, therefore, to consider whether this\nparadigm has a strong enough foundation to support the many exceptions to freedom of\nexpression that purport to rest on it.\n\nShouting Fire: The mother of all exceptions to the First Amendment\n\nJustice Oliver Wendell Holmes’ statement that freedom of speech does not protect someone who\nfalsely shouts “fire” in a theater has been invoked so often, by so many people, in such diverse\ncontexts, that it has become part of our national folk language. It has even appeared —most\nappropriately — in the theater: In Tom Stoppard’s play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,\na character shouts at the audience, “Fire!” He then quickly explains: “It’s all right — ’'m\ndemonstrating the misuse of free speech.”\n\nShouting “Fire!” in the theater may well be the only jurisprudential analogy that has assumed the\nstatus of a folk argument. A prominent historian has characterized it as “the most brilliantly\npersuasive expression that ever came from Holmes’ pen.” But in spite of its hallowed\n\nposition in both the jurisprudence of the First Amendment and the arsenal of political discourse, it\nis and always was an inapt analogy, even in the context in which it was originally offered. It has\n\n°8 An additional, quite controversial, mechanism involves the financing of political campaigns. See Citizen’s\nUnited Case [cite].

This Seventh Sense reacts\nto what none of our other senses can notice, to the subtle undercurrents of a\nnetworked age. That moment of first connection you once had - to a computer, a\nfriend, a fast-moving financial product, a miracle medical cure, an idea, a smashed\nup sound - is like the first time you looked at a Matisse painting or heard Beethoven\n(or Orbital). It switched on a new sensibility. But you have probably had - or will\nshortly - another moment. This is the instant a cold and creeping chill hits you,\nstarted by the uneasy sensation that something you've done has been recorded or\npredicted or watched and manipulated in some way you'd not quite imagined. That\nsome strange force from a great distance has slammed into your life. This feeling is\nthe sudden shudder of a bill come surprisingly due: You wanted to be connected?\nOkay, here’s the cost. And the addition on both sides of the ledger, the massive\nbenefits of our links and the rather terrible potential of those same threads, is still\nbeing settled. We can say at least that the sum of all the revolutions wrought by the\ninstant mingling of the world’s soon-to-be connected billions with each other and\nwith machine intelligence, biological innovation and the tremors of a globalizing\nworld will be, to use Master Nan’s word, “epochal.”\n\nMost of us find ourselves torn now. Not just between future and past; not merely\nbetween the habits and loves of a slower age and the ceaslesss promise of\nsomething fast and new. We are trapped, as well, between two groups. An older\ngeneration now in power, blind to the laws of networks and connection, uses old\nideas to battle problems of a connected age and makes them worse, ever faster.\nTerrorism. Financial chasms. Environmental imbalance. At the same time, an\nemergent class of powerful technologists fingers more influence than perhaps any\ngroup in history. Machines watch, learn, think and increasingly control nearly every\nelement of our lives. This digital-age group understands networks; but if they have\nideas about virtue, philosophy and justice, (mostly they don’t) these feel susbsumed\nby their confidence in networks and control. Each group pulls at the legacy of the\nEnlightenment - our liberty. And, so far, we’ve no way of defending ourselves. No\nnew instinct for life in this still unfathomable age of connection. The Seventh Sense\nis a feeling for just what constant connection means - and the start of (finally) a\nconfident knowledge of how to construct our future and protect ourselves against\nwhat is even now descending upon us. A consciouness exists in the world, Master\nNan would say. It extends over borders, across differences, between people. And it\nbecomes, on networks now, visible in new, powerful and hopeful ways.\n\nWhat I mean by a sensibility is really a kind of instinctive notion, a way to sense and\nthen use the energy flows of our age that hovers perhaps just below what the\nrational mind alone can tell. Master Nan used to recall a famous story from the 2500\nyear old Daoist masterpiece Zhuangzi, about the butcher who worked for a famous\nand powerful Duke. One day the Duke saw the butcher cutting meat, his blade\nsinging and moving with almost no effort. “Ah, this is marvelous. Imagine such\nmastery,’ the Duke said. “How have you achived this?” he asked. “What I follow is\nThe Way,” the butcher said, referring to the idea of a spiritual force, a natural energy\nwhich Daoisim tells us infuses everthing, from trees to the human heart. “When |\nstarted butchering, all I could see was parts of the ox itself.

Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *68\n\ndeveloped considerable evidence that Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire with extensive political and social connections, +! had\nsexually molested more than thirty young girls between 2001 and 2007 at his West Palm Beach mansion. * The U.S.\nAttorney's Office entered mto contentious plea negotiations with Epstein over how the case should be resolved. The\nprosecutors initially sought a resolution that would have required Epstein to plead guilty to at least a felony sex offense. After\npressure from Epstein, for reasons that have never been clearly explained, * the U.S. Attorney's Office agreed to enter into a\nnonprosecution agreement. Under the agreement, the U.S. Attorney's Office agreed not to prosecute him and, in exchange,\nEpstein agreed to plead guilty to two state felonies for soliciting prostitution with a minor. After entering those guilty pleas,\nEpstein was sentenced to only eighteen months in state jail. 44 No federal charges were ever filed and [*69] Epstein spent\nmuch of the jail term on \"work release\" to his luxurious office. *\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office did not tell Epstein's victims about the nonprosecution agreement until well after it had taken effect.\nTo the contrary, even after the nonprosecution agreement had been signed, the Office continued to tell the victims that the case\nwas still \"under investigation\" and that they should be \"patient.\" 4° When the victims learned of the agreement, two of them\n(Jane Doe Number One and Jane Doe Number Two) filed suit in federal court under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, arguing\nthat the prosecutors had violated their CVRA right to confer as well as their right to be treated fairly. 47 The victims contended\nthat prosecutors should have conferred with them about the nonprosecution agreement before it became final.\n\nIn response, the U.S. Attorney's Office argued primarily that it was under no obligation to extend the victims any rights under\nthe CVRA. It was the Government's blunt position that \"CVRA rights do not attach in the absence of federal criminal charges\nfiled by a federal prosecutor.\" 4° In short, the Government argued it was not required to confer in any way with the victims, or\neven treat them fairly, because the CVRA was not yet in play. The issue is thus squarely framed: Is the Government correct in\nits assertion that it has no CVRA obligations in cases like the Epstein case where federal prosecutors never lodged federal\ncharges against a suspect? In view of the CVRA's prominence, resolution of this issue may shed important light on the nature of\ncrime victims’ enactments and the breadth of the role that crime victims should have in the criminal justice process.\n\nII. The CVRA's Application Before Formal Charges are Filed\n\nTo analyze the issue of whether the CVRA extends rights to crime victims before prosecutors have formally filed charges, it is\nuseful to look at the CVRA's purposes, language, and judicial interpretations.

Often the Pi are very simple, implementing for\ninstance numerical inequalities or Boolean equalities.\n\nOnce this graph has been exported into CogPrime, it can be reasoned on, used as raw material\nfor concept formation and predicate formation, and otherwise cognized. Supercompilation pure\nand simple does not change the I/O behavior of the input program. However, the decision graph\nproduced during supercompilation, may be used by CogPrime cognition in order to do so. One\nthen has a hybrid program-modification method composed of two phases: supercompilation for\ntransforming programs into decision graphs, and CogPrime cognition for modifying decision\ngraphs so that they can have different I/O behaviors fulfilling system goals even better than\nthe original.\n\nFurthermore, it seems likely that, in many cases, it may be valuable to have the super-\ncompiler feed many different decision-graph representations of a program into CogPrime. The\nsupercompiler has many internal parameters, and varying them may lead to significantly differ-\nent decision graphs. The decision graph leading to maximal optimization, may not be the one\nthat leads CogPrime cognition in optimal directions.\n\n18.4 Self-Modification via Theorem-Proving\n\nSupercompilation is a potentially very valuable tool for self-modification. If one wants to take an\nexisting schema and gradually improve it for speed, or even for greater effectiveness at achieving\ncurrent goals, supercompilation can potentially do that most excellently.\n\nHowever, the representation that supercompilation creates for a program is very “surface-\nlevel.” No one could read the supercompiled version of a program and understand what it\nwas doing. Really deep self-invented AI innovation requires, we believe, another level of self\nmodification beyond that provided by supercompilation. This other level, we believe, is best\nformulated in terms of theorem-proving [RVO|].\n\nDeep selfmodification could be achieved if CogPrime were capable of proving theorems of\na certain form: namely, theorems about the spacetime complexity and accuracy of particular\ncompound schemata, on average, assuming realistic probability distributions on the inputs, and\nmaking appropriate independence assumptions. These are not exactly the types of theorems that\nare found in human-authored mathematics papers. By and large they will be nasty, complex\ntheorems, not the sort that many human mathematicians enjoy proving or reading. But of\ncourse, there is always the possibility that some elegant gem of a discovery could emerge from\nthis sort of highly detailed theorem-proving work.\n\nIn order to guide it in the formulation of theorems of this nature, the system will have\nempirical data on the spacetime complexity of elementary schemata, and on the probability\ndistributions of inputs to schemata. It can embed these data in axioms, by asking: Assuming\nthe component elementary schemata have complexities within these bounds, and the input pdf\n(probability distribution function) is between these bounds, then what is the pdf of the complexity\nand accuracy of this compound schema?\n\nOf course, this is not an easy sort of question in general: one can have schemata embodying\nany sort of algorithm, including complex algorithms on which computer science professors might\nwrite dozens of research articles. But the system must build up its ability to prove such things\nincrementally, step by step.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013239\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But his \ntreatment of the Wall Street executives involved in the financial meltdown \nwas far less confrontational. \nby Jesse Eisinger \nProPublica, March 12, 2017, 6:22 p.m. \n1 Comment Print Print \nsearch Follow ProPublica \nEmail Updates by email \n_____Preet Bharara, then U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, at Trump \nTower in November 2016 (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) \nAfter his election in 1968, President Richard Nixon asked Robert Morgenthau, the US \nAttorney for the Southern District of New York, to resign. Morgenthau refused to leave \nvoluntarily, saying it degraded the office to treat it as a patronage position. \nNixon's move precipitated a political crisis. The president named a replacement. Powerful \npoliticians lined up to support Morgenthau. Morgenthau had taken on mobsters and power \nbrokers. He had repeatedly prosecuted Roy Cohn, the sleazy New York lawyer who had \nbeen Senator Joe McCarthy's right-hand man. (One of Cohn's clients and protégés was a \nyoung New York City real estate developer named Donald Trump.) When Cohn complained \nthat Morgenthau had a vendetta against him, Morgenthau replied, \"A man is not immune \nfrom prosecution merely because a United States Attorney happens not to like him.\" \nMorgenthau carried that confrontational attitude to the world of business. He pioneered the \nSouthern District's approach to corporate crime. When his prosecutors took on corporate \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019845 \nfraud, they did not reach settlements that called for fines, the current fashion these days. \nThey filed criminal charges against the executives responsible. \nBefore Morgenthau, the Department of Justice focused on two-bit corporate misdeeds \nPonzi schemes and boiler room operations. Morgenthau changed that. His prosecutors went \nafter CEOs and their enablers___the accountants and lawyers who abetted the frauds or \nlooked the other way. \"How do you justify prosecuting a nineteen-year old who sells drugs \non a street corner when you say it's too complicated to go after the people who move the \nmoney?\" he once asked. \nMorgenthau's years as United States Attorney were followed by political success. He was \nelected New York County District Attorney in 1974, the first of seven consecutive terms for \nthat office. \nThere are parallels between Morgenthau, and Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for the \nSouthern District who was fired by President Trump this weekend. \nLike Morgenthau, the 48-year old Bharara leaves the office of US Attorney for the Southern \nDistrict celebrated for taking on corrupt and powerful politicians. Bharara prosecuted two of \nthe infamous \"three men in a room\" who ran New York state: Sheldon Silver, the \nDemocratic speaker of the assembly and Dean Skelos, the Republican Senate majority \nleader. \nHe won convictions of a startling array of local politicians, carrying on the work of the \nMoreland Commission, an ethics inquiry created and then dismissed by New York's Gov. \nAndrew Cuomo. (This weekend, Bharara cryptically tweeted that \"I know what the \nMoreland Commission must have felt like,\" a suggestion that he was fired as he was \npursuing cases pointed at Trump or his allies.) \nBut the record shows that Bharara was much less aggressive when it came to confronting \nWall Street's misdeeds. \nPresident Obama appointed Bharara in 2009, amid the wreckage of the worst financial crisis \nsince the Great Depression. He inherited ongoing investigations into the collapse, including \na probe against Lehman Brothers. \nHe also inherited something he and his young charges found more alluring: insider-trading \ncases against hedge fund managers. His office focused obsessively on those. At one point, \nthe Southern District racked up a record of 85-0 in those cases. (Appeals courts would later \nthrow out two prominent convictions, infuriating him and dealing blows to several other \ncases.) \nHedge funds are safer targets. The firms aren't enmeshed in the global financial markets in \nthe way that giant banks are. Insider trading cases are relatively easy to win and don't \naddress systemic abuses that helped bring down the financial system. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019846 \nEven there his record was more mixed than is popularly understood. As Sheelah Kolhatkar \ndemonstrates in her propulsive and riveting \"Black Edge,\" when it came to bringing his \nbiggest whale to justice, Steve Cohen of SAC Capital, the Southern District blinked. They \ndid not charge him, only securing a guilty plea from his firm. \nPresent and former prosecutors say Bharara did not give much emphasis to investigations \narising from the financial meltdown, an approach shared by his boss, Attorney General Eric \nHolder. Justice Department insiders say many of those inquiries withered not because they \nwere unpromising, but because they had little support. \nBharara missed an opportunity by not bringing any significant criminal charges against \nindividuals in the wake of the collapses of Lehman, investment bank Merrill Lynch, the \ninsurer AIG, the mortgage securities and collateralized debt obligation businesses, or the \nmyriad public misrepresentations from bank CEOs about their finances. \nBharara and senior officials in Washington argue that there were no criminal cases to file \nafter the 2008 crisis. But the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan did pursue significant civil \ncases against the banks for their mortgage activities, cases that had to proove misconduct by \nthe \"preponderance of the evidence.\" And DOJ did win guilty pleas from the banks \nthemselves, an indication that prosecutors might have been able to charge individuals for \ntheir part in crimes their institutions had acknowledged. Academics who studied those years, \nincluding Columbia's Tomasz Piskorski and James Witkin and Chicago's Amit Seru found  \nwidespread patterns of fraud in the mortgage business. \nThe exception makes this failure all the more puzzling. As I detailed in 2014, Bharara's \noffice brought one case for misconduct during the financial crisis____against a mid-level \nbanker. Prosecutors charged Kareem Serageldin of Credit Suisse with overseeing traders \nwho knowingly misrepresented the value of mortgage securities. Serageldin pleaded guilty \nand went to prison. \nSerageldin's colleagues in the industry and others familiar with Credit Suisse found it hard \nto believe that he was the only person involved in that particular fraud. \nBharara's reluctance to pursue senior executives was seen in other investigations of big \nbanks. His office wrested a $1.7 billion fine from JPMorgan Chase over its complicity in the \nBernie Madoff Ponzi scheme, but it brought no charges against individual bankers. \nOne odd aspect of his tenure was the Southern District's willingness to defer to other \njurisdictions when it came to Wall Street cases. \nHistorically, the SDNY has been the leading enforcers of securities laws, nicknamed the \n\"sovereign district\" for its propensity to grab corporate fraud cases from elsewhere on the \nflimsiest of jurisdictional pretexts. Under Bharara, the southern district let other U.S. \nattorneys claim investigations into residential mortgage-backed securities, the instruments at \nthe heart of the financial crisis. Those other offices were not nearly as versed in complex \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019847 \nfinancial cases as their colleagues in Manhattan. In addition, Bharara's office ceded post-\nfinancial crisis investigations into foreign exchange and global interest rate manipulation to \nprosecutors working from the Justice Department's headquarters. \nLike Morgenthau, Bharara was a prominent figure in the New York landscape, given to \nwell-orchestrated press conferences and memorable sound bites. Like Morgenthau, he did \nnot leave office quietly, even thought the president has a longstanding right to name his own \nU.S. attorneys. And like Morgenthau, he may try to parlay his martyrdom into elective \noffice. \nBut if he runs on his record of convictions, as prosecutors often do, voters might want to \nconsider as well the list of possible targets he never pursued. \nLike this story?

Neither was the investigation that followed it, which included the collection of evidence of her attack and a medical examination at a hospital. Instead, Wyatt was vilified for having caused trouble to her community; vile slurs about her penetrability were spray-painted around her town and at her school; she was sent to finish her education elsewhere, and eventually written off as having made a false accusation, the voice she’d worked so hard to raise quelled, her story recalled as fallacious.

The agency has only some 2,300 employees, a very tight\nbudget of about $450 million and limited intelligence-gathering\nresources. Of course, ElBaradei wants to buttress inspection authority\nand capabilities. He wants more intelligence-sharing from the big\npowers. He is particularly angry at Washington for not disclosing its\nintelligence that Syria was building a nuclear facility, and then for\ndoing nothing to stop Israel from bombing that facility in 2007. He\nalso pushes for tougher safeguards for nuclear material and for\nmoving control of the developmental stages of the “fuel cycle” from\nnational to international hands.\n\nThis is all sensible but probably not attainable. While the United\nNations does a number of things quite well, it is not very adept or\ncourageous when it comes to sensitive political matters and national\nprerogatives. Take, for example, the curious fact that the members of\nthe United Nations Commission on Human Rights elected Libya to\nits chairmanship in 2003, despite its appalling record, because it was\n“Africa’s turn.” If this is how business is done, it is unlikely that the\n[.A.E.A.’s board of governors and the Security Council will ever\nendow the agency with the common-sense powers and capabilities\nE|Baradei wants.\n\nBeyond this, ElBaradei insistently describes the United States and\nother great powers as more the problem than the solution.

The\nGeneral Partner cannot provide any assurance that the Fund’s portfolio companies will not be\nCFCs. The CFC rules, however, generally should not affect tax-exempt U.S. Partners.\n\nU.S. Foreign Tax Credits - The Fund may make investments in entities that are formed and\noperating under the laws of countries other than the United States. The countries in which these\nentities are organized and operate may impose taxes on the income of, and distributions or\nother payments made by, these entities. In addition, the Fund and/or the Partners may be\nrequired to file tax or information returns in such non-U.S. jurisdictions. U.S. Partners may be\nentitled, under certain circumstances, to a reduced rate of non-US. tax on their shares of such\nincome or distributions under tax treaties between the United States and the non-US.\njurisdictions imposing such tax, or may, in certain circumstances, be entitled under such treaties\nto file tax returns in such jurisdictions and claim refunds of any amounts of non-U.S. tax over-\nwithheld.\n\nSubject to applicable limitations on foreign tax credits, a U.S. Partner that is subject to U.S.\nfederal income taxation generally should be entitled to elect to treat foreign taxes withheld from\nsuch Partner’s share of the Fund’s dividend and interest income as foreign income taxes eligible\nfor credit against such Partner’s U.S. federal income tax liability. Similarly, each U.S. Partner’s\nshare of any foreign taxes which may be imposed on capital gains or other income realized by\nthe Fund generally should be treated as creditable foreign income taxes. Capital gains realized\nby the Fund, however, may be considered to be from sources within the U.S., which may\neffectively limit the amount of foreign tax credit allowed to the U.S. Partner. Other complex tax\nrules may also limit the availability or use of foreign tax credits, depending on each U.S.\nPartner’s particular circumstances. Because of these limitations, U.S. Partners may be unable to\nclaim a credit for the full amount of their proportionate shares of any foreign taxes paid by the\nFund. U.S. Partners that do not elect to treat their shares of foreign taxes as creditable generally\nmay claim a deduction against U.S. taxable income for such taxes (subject to applicable\nlimitations on losses and deductions). Foreign tax credits or deductions generally will not\nprovide any benefit to tax-exempt U.S. Partners unless such Partners’ distributive shares of the\nincome or gains on which the related foreign income taxes are imposed constitute “unrelated\nbusiness taxable income” and certain other conditions are satisfied. However, since the\navailability of a credit or deduction depends on the particular circumstances of each U.S.\nPartner, Partners are advised to consult their own tax advisors.\n\nForeign Currency Issues - A U.S. Partner's distributive share of profits or losses realized by the\nFund on the conversion of U.S. dollars into non-U.S. currency, or of non-U.S. currency into U.S.\ndollars, generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss rather than capital gain or loss.\nFurther, if the Fund acquires, or becomes the obligor under, a debt instrument or enters into\ncertain other transactions, any of which is denominated in terms of a currency other than the\nU.S. dollar, fluctuations in the value of that currency relative to the U.S. dollar generally will\nresult in foreign currency gain or loss realized by the Fund and will be included in the U.S.\nPartners’ distributive shares of Fund profits or losses as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss\nrather than capital gain or loss.\n\n78 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024089\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The\nDepartment prefers the language that was added by the 2005 reauthorization of the Trafficking\nVictims Protection Act, which evaluated whether countries “adopted measures” to reduce\ndemand,\n\n6. Section 107\n\nSection 107(a) of the Act raises separation of powers and Chadha concerns. Section\n107(a) would add a new 22 U.S.C. § 7107(b)(3)(D), which would limit the amount of time that a\ncountry could remain on the Tier IT Watch List to two years, “unless the Secretary of State\nprovides to the appropriate congressional committees credible evidence that” the country had\ntaken certain steps to make significant efforts to counter trafficking. That provision further\nrequires that “[s]uch credible evidence” shall be provided to Congress in a report.\n\nTo the extent that section 107(a) purports to give congressional committees authority to\ndetermine whether the Secretary’s decision to exempt a country from the watch list is based on\nsufficiently “credible evidence,” the provision would give the committees a role in executing the\nlaw that the Constitution does not allow. “{O]nce Congress makes its choice in enacting\nlegislation, its participation ends.

To avoid this concern, we recommend\nreplacing “provides to the appropriate congressional committees credible evidence” with\n“determines;” and replacing “Such credible evidence” with “Such determination.”\n\nTs Section 108\n\nDOJ opposes the requirement in section 108 to create a database “combining all\napplicable data collected by each Federal department and agency represented on the Interagency\nTask Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking.” The database would contain law enforcement\nsensitive information, which would prevent the data from being accessible to non-law\nenforcement agencies, many of which are a part of the interagency task force, Furthermore, such\na database would be difficult to create, particularly within the timeframe provided in the statute,\nbecause it would require information from multiple agencies that collect data in varying forms\nand levels of specificity,\n\n8. Section 109\nThis section authorizes the President to establish an award for efforts against trafficking\n\nand directs him to establish procedures for selecting recipients of the award.

In a laboratory study, an experimenter offered subjects the opportunity to earn up to\n$10 on a vocabulary quiz. Once they finished the quiz, they learned that an anonymous person in another\nroom either took some of their earnings or left it alone. With this information in hand, the quiz-taker\ncould either vindictively punish the person by giving them some hot sauce or they could cash out of the\ngame and recover the money lost. In other words, they could either vindictively burn their opponent or\nrecover their losses at no cost. In reality, there was no partner in the other room. When subjects with the\nlow expressing form of MAOA lost most of their earnings, they were far more likely to deliver the hot\nsauce than those with the high expressing form; they were also most likely to deliver the highest amount\nof the sauce. Like long-term parental abuse, even short-term provocation invoked in a laboratory\nenvironment can cause those with the low expressing form of MAOA to act out and attack.\n\nAs with all genes that have different forms, the number of individuals with the low expressing\nform of MAOA varies by population, including different ethnic and culturally identified groups.\nCaucasian and Hispanic males show some of the lowest frequencies at 34 and 29 % respectively, whereas\nMaori, Pacific Islander, and Chinese males show the highest at 56, 61, and 77% respectively. In a study of\nover 1000 men, individuals with the low expressing form of MAOA were more likely to be in violent\ngangs, and once in gangs, were more likely to use guns and knives than individuals with the high\nexpressing form. Variation in the frequency of these two forms is interesting as it provides the signature\nhandiwork of natural selection. When the frequency of one form goes up, the most likely explanation is\nthat this form benefits the individual carriers. When the frequency goes down, there is a hidden cost. In\nlight of this teeter-tottering of frequencies, the Maori are of interest. As celebrated by many New\nZealanders today, the Maori were a highly adventurous and warring people. Individuals who took risks\nand fiercely defended their resources were heroes. Heroes may have been carriers of the low expressing\nform of MAOA. Heroes often leave more offspring, who were also carriers of the low expressing form.\nIn the Maori environment, selection may well have favored this form of the gene. The important point is\nthat different environments will favor different frequencies of the two forms of MAOA. This helps\nexplain both the cause of individual differences and the challenges we face in confronting cultures of\nviolence that are fueled by nature and nurture.\n\nMany other labs have followed up on Caspi and Moffitt’s long term, developmental study. Most\nfind the same relationship between the MAOA gene and antisocial behavior. Others add to this account\nby showing how different genes and early appearing physiological differences contribute to a highly\n\naggressive and antisocial starting state.

Like so many simple claims that go unchallenged, we should be\npuzzled by this one. We should ask: what’s normal?\n\nThe evolutionary history of each species’ brain does not provide a complete account of what the\nbrain can do. Consider again a topic from chapter 1: domesticated dogs and their ancestors, the wolves.\nThough dogs live with humans, and are often raised by them, they never acquire a human language. In\nthis sense, the domesticated dog is just like the wolf. But what dogs can do, with greater facility than any\nwild wolf, is understand a variety of human gestures such as pointing and the movement of our eyes. This\ncapacity emerged following a period of human domestication. Wolves were not part of this selective\nregime. But, and this is the most interesting twist in the story, wolf puppies raised by human caretakers\ndevelop into adults that can read pointing and looking extremely well. This tells us that even wolves\nevolved the potential to read human gestures, but only human environments favor this skill. This tells us\nthat what animals express is not necessarily indicative of their potential. To uncover their potential, we\nmust alter the environment or wait for such changes to happen naturally.\n\nWhen we ask What's normal), we are asking two questions: what is the evolved repertoire and\nwhat is the evolved capacity? The evolved repertoire tells us something about the relationship between a\nspecies’ biology and the environments that have shaped their behavior. The evolved capacity tells us\nabout a reservoir of behaviors that may only emerge in novel environments.\n\nWhat’s normal human behavior? The same distinctions apply to us as to dogs and wolves, with\nthe extra complication that our species adds because of historical twists and turns orchestrated by legal,\npolitical, ethical, religious, and medical points of view. History presents us with hundreds of cases where\nan accepted normal mutated into abnormal, or where abnormal transformed into normal. During the\nItalian Baroque —a period of decadence that started in the late 16th century and ended in the early 18th\ncentury — some 500,000 boys were castrated in order to freeze their youthful voices for the enjoyment\nof others. These castrati formed an essential part of music culture, of what people expected and wanted.\nFor many of these young boys, not only did castration end their reproductive careers, but often, their\nlives.\n\nAs the 18th century drew to a close, so too did castration in the name of art. What was normal\nthen is perceived as abnormal and heinous today. The same story can be told for other sexual practices,\nincluding female genital mutilation, circumcision, and homosexuality. In the United States,\nhomosexuality was considered a disease before the 1970s, with its own entry in the Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Thanks to an underground movement of gay psychiatrists and\nthe work of Evelyn Hooker who discovered that the manual’s classification entry was based entirely on\nclinical interviews of gay prisoners, homosexuality has been freed from its jail sentence as a mental\n\ndisease — as abnormal.\n\nHauser Chapter 4.

We're determined to undermine it. For example, we \nknow there are many different reasons why individuals—from many different faiths—succumb to terrorist \nideologies. And there is no one easy profile of a terrorist. But based on extensive investigations, research and \nprofiles of the violent extremists we've captured or arrested, and who falsely claim to be fighting in the name of \nIslam, we know that they all share one thing—they all believe that the United States is somehow at war with \nIslam, and that this justifies violence against Americans. So we are actively and aggressively undermining that \nideology. We're exposing the lie that America and Islam are somehow in conflict. That is why President Obama \nhas stated time and again that the United States is not and never will be at war with Islam.\" \nThis statement encapsulates so much of what this writer has identified as the \"Control Factor:\" that function of \nour minds which will distort our perceptions so as not to present ourselves with the ever so fearful reality that \nconfronts us under the banner of Islam today. That is, rather than to clearly see, focus upon, and set about to \ncreate strategies to properly confront the threat which we currently face- a threat that by definition we do not \ncontrol and see little way over which to regain control- our minds essentially collude to reconstruct in a manner \nwhich deludes us with the sense that we are in control. \n1. The statement essentially reduces the threat we face to that of terrorism caused by al-Qaeda. By defining and \nlimiting the threat to a band of \"radical extremists\" who have distorted the doctrine of a great religion, we buy \ninto the sense that our military might and criminal detection methods will ultimately save the day. The fantasy is \nthat this is a problem that we can get our arms around because under our Constitutional principles, terrorism is a \nviolation that we are permitted to fight against. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031688 \nYet terrorism is only one of three levels upon which the threat is attacking us and al-Qaeda is only a piece of the \nterrorism level. The second level, the \"Civilization Jihad,\" a term used by the Muslim Brotherhood itself to \ndescribe its long term effort to peaceably infiltrate American and Western society at all levels in order to bring it \ndown from the inside through the freedoms that Western Constitutions afford, is well at work and in process \ntoday. This has also been called the \"Stealth Jihad.\" \nThere is a third level, the \"International Institutional Jihad,\" upon which organizations such as the UN, along with \nits 57 Member State bloc the Organization of the Islamic Conference, work to push through those principles of \nSharia Law and Islamic doctrine which it Members can agree upon such as the 1990 Cairo Declaration of Human \nRights which is fully at odds with U.S. Constitutional tenets. Once these principles become international \nstandards, the institutions seek to push them into Western societies through treaties and trade deals over which \nthe Members have leverage. \nMcDonough's words, by limiting the threat to Al Qaeda, intentionally ignore the other levels of threat which, for \nall intents and purposes can be even more dangerous because our Constitution does not afford us easy means to \ncombat. Nor does our desired general sense of morality. \n2. By focusing on \"reasons\" for this terrorist piece of the pie, the Control Factor further sets out the narrative \nthat we can gain control over the problem. By looking for \"root causes,\" we advance the notion that by \neliminating or reducing those elements we can eliminate the symptom-terrorism. This is part of a long-engaged \nLeftist narrative that has been utilized across a vast array of social problems in order to gain control over funding \nand policy. Now, it is being used to avoid seeing a problem clearly, much less addressing it intelligently. \nIt is this administration's (and also, unfortunately, many members of Bush's as well) distortion to frame terrorism \nas a result of victimhood. That is, by establishing the root causes of terrorism as either a response to U.S. policy, \nto economic conditions, to Israeli occupation, and so on, the Control Factor sells the buried wish that since we \ncause the conditions, we can fix the symptom without the grueling costs of war and confrontation. When both \nsides collude in this form of narrative, we allow it to continue and grow. Yet placing the cause of the problem \nwithin ourselves is false and strips us of the proper incentive to stand up and fight against a threat that simply \nseeks our destruction no matter what we do. \n3. McDonough fights the enemy's battle for us in the simple phrase of those \"who falsely claim to be fighting in \nthe name of Islam.\" Here, the Control Factor refuses to accept what the enemy has repeatedly made clear—there \nis a Holy War between Islam and the Western world, it has been declared by a significant faction of Muslims and \nagreed upon by many more either explicitly or through silence and omission, and the war is defined by the enemy \nitself under the banner of Islam to seek the destruction of Western society as it is and to replace it with a Sharia \nbased global Islamic Ummah. This is what the enemy says itself. The Control Factor tells us that this can not be, \nthat Islam is a \"peaceful\" and \"great\" religion that has been \"hijacked\" by a few \"crazies\" and that most \nMuslims worldwide are much like us peace loving Westerners who seek a world based on mutual tolerance. If \nthere is any \"war,\" it emanates from those of us Westerners who are \"racists,\" \"bigots,\" or otherwise and fail to \nacknowledge the realities of the Muslim peoples. The critical issue here is that the Control Factor, as expressed \nthrough McDonough, takes full responsibility for defining Islam and identifying the enemy. The enemy, however, \ndefines itself and needs to identify itself both through its actions, its words, and importantly what it does not do \nand say. \nThis \"transfer of responsibility\" from the enemy to ourselves that McDonough's words so freely take on is \nsymptomatic of the deep addictive style the West has adopted to avoid hard confrontation. Once again, the \nControl Factor utilizes Western guilt to define the conflict as resulting from improper acts of its own. It then \nseeks to redeem itself by accommodating the enemy. This shows up in America's dealings with Islam as well as \nthe \"Israeli-Palestinian Conflict;\" responsibility for the problem is transferred to the West or Israel in a grand \npsychological effort to avoid facing the terrors and costs of hard confrontation, terror, or war. And in each \nexample, as with all psychological defenses, the defense creates the very conditions it seeks to avoid. Until the \nWest is fully able to place responsibility back upon the Islamic world for the actions it takes and omits to take, \nthe West will only dig itself deeper into a weaker position. Unfortunately, the game of guilt gives us no guidance \nas to how it is to end; when enough has been repaid. Instead, it is geared to continue indefinitely. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031689 \n4. McDonough's statement that the U.S. is not at war with Islam is a pleasant Control Factor fantasy but does \nlittle to eliminate the fact that the enemy has declared it so. We can walk away and pretend there is no war, \nfollow the deceptive words of those in this country engaged in the Civilization Jihad who attack us for any \nresponse to the war other than bending over backwards to accommodate Islam and tolerate that which does not \ntolerate anything other than itself. Yet that path leads only to further the cause of the enemy. \n5. Perhaps most telling of all of McDonough's statement is the word \"never.\" To claim we will never be at war \nwith Islam regardless of what Islam or Muslims worldwide do to us is the height of Dhimmitude—a phrase coined \nby Bat Yeor, an expert on Dhimmi behavior throughout Islamic history. In Islam, a Dhimmi is generally a Jew or \nChristian (there are others) who has agreed to accept a lesser and humiliating status with duties including the \npayment of a special tax, in exchange for life in an Islamic controlled land. It is a protection contract: you can \nlive as long as you abide by these conditions. In claiming that we could \"never\" be at war with Islam, McDonough \nhas staked out Dhimmi status for all non-Muslims in the U.S. and has put words to the famous act of Obama in \nbowing to the King of Saudi Arabia. \nBy denying that we are at war with Islam, McDonough has admitted that those words have meaning, just that \nthey do not fit U.S. policy. By denying that the U.S. would ever be at war with Islam, McDonough has sent the \nmessage of unconditional surrender in advance. This is pure Control Factor maneuvering and threatens our nation \nworse than the underlying threat itself. Put simply, our Constitution does not afford us easy ways to combat the \nthreat we face- we can fight certain types of terrorism in certain (albeit still under great dispute) ways yet we \nhave no effective means to combat the Civilization Jihad and are fast losing leverage to resist the International \nInstitutional Jihad. Unless and until we all obtain better control over our Control Factors so that we can develop \nsufficient acceptable means to fight on these levels, we are headed to self-destruction. \nFaMi iy.SeCUri tyMatters.org Contributing Editor Bill Siegel lives in New York and is the author of the forthcoming book, The Control Factor ©. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031690 \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But as you may know, it is a topic of considerable public debate, and \nseveral governments have been investigating the owners of such accounts. \nThere are a number of ways such accounts and also offshore trusts have been used to avoid inheritance tax, UK \ndomestic tax, or tax imposed by other countries. Such accounts have also been used to launder money. \nWe have seen records held in the US identifying you among those who have held accounts. These accounts \ncontained assets of up to USD 3.5m, and include: \n1) You may therefore have been a person evading or avoiding tax, or laundering money. \nWe will be particularly concerned with these questions: \n2) Why you had Swiss accounts. \n3) How much back tax you have settled with the tax authorities following their investigation of your affairs. \nAdditionally, from public records and from material we have seen we note that: \n4) In 2008 you pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and procuring minors for prostitution. You were \nsentenced to 18 months in prison. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030597 \n5) Your above accounts were also linked with Mr Leslie Wexner. \n6) You are known to be or have previously been closely associated with Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and \nKevin Spacey. \n7) You have made substantial contributions to the Clintons' philanthropic causes.

Nonetheless, we think it\nprobable that Roth remains intact only with respect to public distribution in the full sense,\nand that restricted distribution, adequately controlled, is no longer to be condemned.\n\nIf a rich Stanley can view a film, or read a book, in his home, a poorer Stanley should be\nfree to visit a protected theater or library. We see no reason for saying he must go alone.\n\nIt was the first time in history that a court—any court—had ruled that the government had no\npower to ban or prosecute an “obscene” film that was shown to the public in a theater. I had\nachieved a total victory not only for my client, but for my novel approach to offensiveness under\nthe First Amendment. It was a heck of a way to begin my career as a lawyer. The victory would,\nhowever, be short lived, at least in theory, if not in practice.\n\nNot surprisingly, the District Attorney appealed our victory to the Supreme Court, which\naccepted the case. I was asked to argue for Grove Press. And so, at the age of 31, I argued my\nfirst case before the High Court.\n\n102\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017189\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

I was shocked when I later learned of her complaint, not least\nbecause there was no inappropriate interaction and also because well after the date on which she is said to have\nbeen offended, she continued to email me with joking questions or comments, and ata AAAS conference in\n2008, for which she had asked, and for which I had written her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife\nand I gave her a lift well out out of our way to drop her off at her hotel, and I note in an email response to her\nemail about the conference, agin in 2008, I expressed that I would pass her regards along to my wife and vice\nversa. When the University informed me of the complaint I was shocked and concerned. When I spoke to\n\nthe human resources person, including relating my concerns and providing the emails in question, I was told\nthat no formal complaint of sexual harassment was deemed to be warranted in this case, and that the young\nwoman in question had agreed to that. By that time I learned of the complaint I had already announced my\nintentions to leave Case to accept an offer at ASU—a very difficult decision for me because of my long-\nstanding attachment to the University, and the excellent relations I had with my colleagues there, both among\nthe faculty and among the administration. Because I was already in Arizona at the time I was asked not to have\nany further interaction with the student I agreed to that request because it was basically moot. I was also told\nthat because it was being handled informally, that (a) it should remain confidential, which I, at least abided by,\nand (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would remove the allegation from\nmy record after 5 years, which makes me surprised that someone violated that written agreement with you.\n\nRe item 6: You report on ASU’s response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically\nstated there were never any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and the\noutside complaints were in fact related specifically to your item #6. Further you neglect to mention that this\ncomplaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual who was allegedly harassed, who never lodged a\ncomplain, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged transgression. I was surprised and\ndismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by both Universities\nthat because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private events unrelated to\nthe University would be investigated. The complaint was investigated throughly by both ASU and ANU and\nboth came to the conclusion that it was not credible and no university policies had been violated. . In addition\nANU’s investigation, which took a full month found significant inconsistencies in the allegation, suggesting\ndistortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU report. The initial complaint, which in fact resulted in a\ntemporary suspension by ANU outlined the claim you made in the words you quoted in your note to me, along\nwith the statement made in the complaint that\n\n\"It is the University’s understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the\ntime of the incident.”\n\nAfter the investigation, the final report absolved me of any wrongdoing, and indicated information inconsistent\nwith the original claim and apparent later claims as follows:\n\n\"The allegations were made by an observer to the incident.\n\n- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched\nin\n\nan unwelcome manner.\n\n- The conference attendee who took the ‘selfie’ photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference\norganisers\n\nat the time of the incident (November 2016).\n\n- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference\norganisers\n\nat the time of the incident (November 2016).\n\nThe photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact.\n\n- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who\ntook\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031240\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Last night was like no other in our\npolitical memory, defying the predictions of the most erudite pundits and political\nprognosticators.\n\nToday, we are spending a great deal of time unpacking the election results with our students\nacross the three divisions — during morning meeting and throughout the day in Lower School\nclassrooms, in Middle School advisories, during Upper School Community time, as well as in\nmany individual classroom conversations. I write to assure you that we will do our best to handle\nthese discussions with balance, sensitivity, and fairness.\n\nGiven that last week's mock election among Packer’s Upper School students showed that over\n80% favored Secretary Clinton, I don’t think it’s a huge leap to assume that there was more\ndisappointment than joy in Packer households as results unfolded last night. At the same time,\nthere are certainly Packer families who support Mr. Trump and are pleased with this outcome. As\na school community, we have an obligation to recognize that there will be a broad array of feelings\ngenerated by the election results, and it is our responsibility as a school to make space for these\nfeelings to be expressed thoughtfully and compassionately, as well as to model the tolerance and\nacceptance of difference that are among our core values. No doubt, we have our work cut out for\nus, but Iam confident in the good that we can do as a community.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033189\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The central force was now ordered\nto mount an attack that would bring them within striking distance of the Beirut-\nDamasus road. The first skirmish came in the hilltop town of Jezzin, still barely\nwithin the 40-kilometer zone. The Syrians had a commando force and tanks in\nthe town. An Israeli battalion was ordered in, and it took Jezzin by the evening\nof June 8. But it came under assault from Syrian units with grenades, RPGs and\nSaggers, as well as shellfire from a nearby ridge. Shortly before midnight,\nanother unit of Israeli tanks and infantry passed through the central Lebanese\nvillage of Ayn Zhalta, to the north of Jezzin and beyond the 40-kilometer line,\nand began winding its way through a valley toward the Beirut-Damascus road.\nThey waded into a Syrian ambush, and for hours found themselves in a fierce\nbattle with Syrian units.\n\nI don’t believe Arik specifically planned to confront the Syrians in Jezzin\nand Ayn Zhalta. But he could not have doubted that, grven the enormous scale\nand range of our invasion, a clash with Syrian forces would happen at some\npoint. Now that it had, all that remained was for him to tell the cabinet that\nIsraeli forces had come under Syrian fire and insist, as defense minister, that the\nimperative for our forces on the ground was to strike back.\n\nOn the afternoon of June 9, the fourth day of the war, we got the order to go\non the offensive against the Syrians in the Bekaa. As our artillery pounded the\nsouthernmost SAM sites, nearly 100 Israeli jets swarmed into the Bekaa Valley\nand attacked Syria’s air defenses in eastern Lebanon. When a second wave\nscreamed in an hour later, the Syrians sent up their Soviet-made MiGs to\nintercept them. Forty-one Syrian planes were shot down.

Working with Mookie and the rest of my\nteam, I’d been in charge of all the initial planning. I was in command of the\nSabena assault, the only remotely similar operation Israel had attempted.\nThough an attempt to rescue dozens of terrified hostages in Entebbe, with both\nthe terrorists and possibly Ugandan soldiers armed and ready, would be much\nharder. As Sayeret Matkal commander, I’d conceived and commanded other\nmissions that requiring us to break new ground. But — and it was a huge but — I\nknew from the moment I left Kuti’s office that I would have to find a way to\navoid undermining the current sayeret commander, Yoni. Dan had clearly been\naware of that as well. He’d stressed to Kuti that he meant no disrespect to Yoni.\n“But I know Ehud,” he said. “I’ve worked with him. I want him to lead it.”\n\nYoni was still in the Sinai. ’'d phoned him before our first overnight\nplanning session to tell him I was bringing in Mookie and Amiram. Mookie had\nbeen giving him daily updates. But the clock was ticking. Under the initial\ndeadline, the hijackers had threatened to begin “executions” on Thursday.\nToday. The deadline had now been pushed back, but only until Sunday morning\n—and only after Rabin felt he had no option but to drop our public refusal to\nconsider negotiating with them.\n\nWhen Dan called our first operational briefing for Thursday night, Mookie\nsent a plane to bring Yoni back. Dan set out the plan with his customary\nconfidence. The four Hercules would take off on Saturday evening from Sharm\nel-Sheikh at the southernmost tip of the Sinai, to cut the flying distance at least\nslightly. The first plane would land on the runway near the new terminal. Inside\nwould be a small unit of paratroopers, the sayeret strike force, a pair of Jeeps\nand the Mercedes. The next Hercules wouldn’t arrive for another seven minutes:\nthe most critical minutes of the whole operation. That was when our “Ugandan\nmotorcade” would make its way to the old terminal, burst in and take care of the\nterrorists. The second Hercules would include another Sayeret Matkal team, to\nreinforce the attack unit and secure the perimeter of the old terminal. Hercules\nNumber Three, a minute later, would carry a joint force of sayeret fighters,\nparatroopers and a Golani team. Their job would be to take over the new\nterminal and the rest of the airport and deal with any Ugandan army resistance.\nThe final plane was a flying medical unit, to provide treatment for the hostages\nand carry them back to Israel.\n\nYoni arrived just as Dan was finishing his presentation. He looked focused,\nenergized, and eager to play his part. I realized it was important to explain to\nhim the decision to place me in command.

There is no smoking gun beyond the often flagrant, custom-\nbreaking, events of the President's 16 months in office. Indeed, much of\nthe evidence is based on the President's public statements and tweets\nabout those events. \"This indictment could have been drafted without\nanyone being interviewed,\" said one source. This is, from the\nperspective of White House sources good news: the case then, is just an\nissue of what motives are ascribed to the President's behavior—\nbehavior that is, the President's supporters believe it is easy to show,\nimpulsive and not thought out. Hence no intent. For the Mueller team, it\nis precisely that careless behavior and flagrant disregard for\nconstitutional standards that they hope-to put on trial.\n\nAccording to a source involved in the Mueller strategy, the plan to\nindict the President is now \"more advanced\" than it was when the terms\nof the indictment were agreed in April. In the intervening months, the\npresident’s lawyers, spokespersons and surrogates have staged a very\npublic debate about whether such a legal proceeding would be\nconstitutional—in effect trying to discredit, ahead of time, any\nprosecutorial action the Special Counsel’s office might take. This may be\na preemptive response to an indictment they expect is forthcoming. It\nmay also be an effort to pressure Rosenstein. It may even be an effort to\nconvince Mueller of that, since some in the White House believe that\nthat the plan to indict is not a strategy yet embraced by the whole\nSpecial Counsel’s office, but one that is being advocated only by its most\nvirulently anti-Trump purists on the investigative team—most notably\nby the number two lawyer under Mueller, Andrew Weissmann.\n\nIt may be noteworthy that there appears now not to be plan for an\nindictment related to collusion, although, legal experts say, that could\ncome later and may depend on new information from the investigation\nof the President's personal attorney, Michael Cohen. It is also possible\nthat alternative plans have been made—preparation for more expansive\nindictments, for instance, or for a broader report that would include the\nallegations of obstruction but not seek to indict the President.\n\nThe White House view is that without the underlying collusion\ncharge—\"real collusion,\" in the words of one White House advisor, “and\nnot just a bunch of Facebook ads and some trolls\"—Mueller will be\npresenting a weak and politically-motivated case. \"That's a witch hunt,\"\nsaid the advisor. The view of the Mueller team, or at least that of its\nmost ardent members, seems to be that the obstruction charges go to\nthe very heart of exposing how Trump has abused his power and turned\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030259\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

No matter how we might explain our attack, with the joint exercises soon to\nbegin, it would come over as a deliberate attempt to implicate our most important\nally in a potential conflict with Iran, against the explicit wishes of President\nObama. I felt this even more strongly when, a few weeks later, I was contacted by\none of Bibi’s close political allies. He sounded me out on the possibility of\nlaunching our strike against Iran after the joint exercise: barely two weeks before\nthe 2012 US election. Politically, he argued, Obama would then feel compelled to\nsupport Israel’s action, or at the very least to refrain from criticizing it. In other\nwords, we would be setting a political trap for the President of the United States. I\ncouldn’t quite believe he was suggesting it.

But as with so much else\nin the years I spent in his government, I think it was the politics of the scheme,\nmore than the substance, that enticed him. Almost everything he did seemed\nincreasingly about creating a kind of grand narrative to secure his position on the\nright, solidifying a base which he figured would sustain him in office. At its core,\nthe narrative presented a picture of vulnerability and victimhood: a kind of\n“fortress Israel” threatened by terror, missiles on its northern and southern borders,\nand now potential nuclear annihilation from Iran, while our main ally, the United\nStates, was under the sway of a President who neither understood nor\nfundamentally supported us. In day-to-day policy terms, this allowed Bibi to insist\nwe couldn’t risk serious engagement with the Palestinians. On domestic issues as\nwell, like the widening gap between those at the top of our high-tech economy and\na painfully squeezed middle class, the sense of crisis he encouraged gave him\nlicense to hunker down, warn of impending doom, and do virtually nothing.\n\nEffective though the narrative was for him politically, it bore no resemblance to\nreality.

Wisner arrived a\nfew years later. Though not quite a friend, Wisner had cultivated a directness at\nleast, with Mubarak. He’d become a mirror in which the Egyptian president might\nsee how different stances towards America or Israel would appear to the rest of the\nworld. So when, in the winter of 2011, the White House saw Mubarak facing waves\nof unimagined protest, ata moment when it looked like the Egyptian president\nwould become the latest head of state to topple amidst the accelerating discontent\nthat would be known as the Arab Spring, they sent Wisner with a message for\nMubarak: No killing - and it is time for you to retire.\n\nWisner later recalled the tension of Cairo when he arrived. The city felt nervous ina\nway he’d not seen before. He landed in the early morning and went almost\nimmediately to see the President. The situation would be brought back to normal,\nMubarak assured Wisner. Soon. He’d fired most of his cabinet a few days earlier. He\nhad promised reform, and had begun studying what might be done first, and how\nsoon it might be carefully attempted. He hinted to Wisner that the rumored\ntransition of power to his son Gamal was not, after all, inevitable. But, Mubarak said,\nhe wasn’t going anywhere just now.\n\nWisner tried another tack: He asked if the President would like to leave the country.\nMaybe a trip for medical treatment? Mubarak dismissed the idea. He’d seen worse,\nhe reminded Wisner. Mubarak had been sitting inches away from Sadat on that\nfateful October day in 1981. He himself had survived six assassination attempts. In\nfact, he said he intended to go on television again that very evening. He would speak\ndirectly to the protestors. He would tell them and the Egyptian people of his plans\nfor reform and for a gradual transition of power. He would remind them of the\ngreatness of their national spirit. He would evoke the immensity of their ancient\nhistory. And he would be sure they understood that he would stay, he would die on\nEgyptian soil. You can tell that to the White House too, Mubarak told Wisner. He\nvouchsafed, at the end of their talk, at least some of the assurances the envoy had\ncome to collect: No violence. A graceful departure at some point. Elections, even. But\nall on his timetable.\n\nAround Mubarak in those days, Wisner recalled, he saw bafflement. Resolution\nadmixed with surprise. These men in that Egyptian power structure, all wealthy and\ncomfortable and perfectly secure, had thought their places impregnable. They were,\nafter all, the thin human line between the modern world and the boiling mad Islamic\nfundamentalists who hungered to rule the country. They'd arrested the usual\ndissidents, closed down the normal channels, checked with their informants.\nNothing. The old, reliable vents for unrest hadn’t worked. The pressures grew. It\nwas perhaps easy to understand why they thought they’d survive. They'd never\nfailed. Mubarak had been president for 30 years. For now, at least, the syllogistic\nlogic fluttering through the President’s own arguments reassured them: Egypt\nwants stability. Only I can deliver stability. Therefore, Egypt wants me.\n\nWisner left the Presidential Palace. He reported what he’d learned back to\nWashington and, work done, headed to the airport.

Later, networks of trade overlaid the Mediterranean, which became\nthe heart of the wealthy Carthaginian, Roman and Byzantine empires. And the\ngreatest geographical empire in history, Great Britain, was nothing if not a network\npower, run on sea lines. Waterways, for centuries, pulsed with power. They were\nvital for trade, essential in war and crucial for national freedom.\n\nNetwork empires emerged on land too, assembled from connected webs of politics,\nof silk and tobacco and gold, or from shared religious passions.

I was particularly interested in his recruitment of three top American intelligence\nofficers; Aldrich Ames in the CIA, Robert Hanssen in the FBI and Ronald Pelton in the NSA. I hoped that\nseeing these intelligence coups through the eyes, and mind-set, of their KGB handler might provide some\nhistorical context for the Snowden defection. So I invited Cherkashin to lunch at Gusto, a quiet Italian\nrestaurant, located near the Chekov Theater in central Moscow,\n\nCherkashin, a tall thin man with silver hair, showed up promptly at 1 pm. Wearing an elegant grey suit\nand dark tie, he walked with a spry step. Since he had served in counterintelligence in the Soviet Embassy\nin Washington D.C. for nearly a decade, he spoke flawless English,\n\nI began the interview with one of the more celebrated cases he handled: the KGB recruitment of Aldrich\nAmes. Ames, a CIA counterintelligence officer, had worked as a Russian mole between April 1985 and\nJanuary 1994. In those nine years, he rose, or was maneuvered by the KGB, into a top position in the\nCIA's highly-sensitive Counterintelligence Center Analysis Group, which allowed him to deliver\nhundreds of top secrets to the KGB. In return, according to Cherkashin, Ames received in cash\nbetween $20,000 and $50,000 for each delivery, which amounted to $4.6 million over the nine\nyears.\n\nI asked Cherkashin about the weakness the KGB looked for in an American intelligence worker\nthat might lead him to copy and steal top secret documents. How did he spot a potential Ames?\nWas it a financial problem? Was it a sexual vulnerability? Was it an ideological leaning?\n\n“Nothing so dramatic,” he answered. What he looked for when assessing Ames’s potential was\nan intelligence officer who is both dissatisfied and antagonistic to the service for which he works.”\n\n“The classic disgruntle employee,” I interjected.\n\n“Any intelligence officer who strongly feels that his superiors are not listening to him, and that\nthey are doing stupid things, is a candidate,” he continued. He said he had found that the flaw in a\nprospect that could be most dependably exploited was not his greed, lust, or deviant behavior but\nhis resentment over the way he was being treated.\n\n“Ts that how you spotted Ames?”\n\n“Actually he approached us, not vice versa.” It was his job in the CIA to approach opposition\nKGB officers. “But yes we saw the potential,” he said.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020350\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

When the erect figure of Sadat\nemerged, there was spontaneous applause, and a serenade from Israeli army\ntrumpeters.\n\nEven before Sadat’s Knesset address the next day, I understood that his visit,\nhis willingness to make the first, bold move toward a possible peace, marked\njust the beginning of a difficult negotiating road. But there was one passage in\nhis speech that touched me especially. He ran through the history of how Egypt\nand other Arab states had not just fought Israel, but denied our right to exist as a\nstate. “We used to brand you as so-called Israel,” he said. Now, the leader of\nour most important Arab enemy declared: “You want to live with us in this part\nof the world. In all sincerity, I tell you that we welcome you among us, with full\nsecurity and safety.”\n\nThe formula he proposed was straightforward. Egypt would agree to a full\npeace, accepting and formally recognizing the state of Israel. But Israel would\nhave to withdraw from all Arab land captured in 1967, including “Arab\nJerusalem.” We would also have to accept the “rights of the Palestinian people\nto self-determination, including their right to establish their own state.” Begin’s\nreply was more sensitive than I’d expected from a leader who, through my\nLabor kibbutnzik eyes, I'd always seen as an extremist, unwaveringly\ncommitted to a “greater Israel”. Though he did make it clear his views on the\nshape of an eventual peace differed from Sadat’s, he proposed further talks with\nthe aim of finding an agreement both sides could live with. Still, like all Israelis,\nI knew he would never accept at least two of the Egyptian president’s demands:\na retreat from our control of a united Jerusalem or the creation of a Palestinian\nstate on the West Bank of the Jordan: for Begin, biblical Judaea and Samaria.\n\nOn our territorial dispute with Egypt, I did believe a deal was possible. I\ndidn’t expect us to return all of the Sinai, if only because I couldn’t see Begin\nagreeing to it. For security reasons, I also felt we should try to hold on to a pair\nof air force bases built after 1967, with American help, just a few miles over the\nNegev border. But as for the rest, I saw no reason not to give it back. As I’d told\nMotta after the 1973 war, I'd long believed Israel had lost sight of the original\nreason we’d held onto the Sinai after 1967. It was supposed to be a huge, sandy\nsecurity buffer. If we did manage to make peace with Egypt, there was surely no\nreason to hold on to it.\n\nThe moment of truth came almost exactly 10 months later, in September\n1978. American President Jimmy Carter hosted a summit with Begin and Sadat\nat Camp David, in search of a “framework agreement” for final negotiations on\n\n184\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011655\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He received an 18-month jail sentence, of which \nhe served 13. \nA former federal prosecutor of 15 years, Mark Johnson of Stuart, said the disparity in the potential sentences was \nunusual. \nThe United States Attorney's Office also agreed not to charge any of Epstein's possible co-conspirators - Sarah \nKellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff and Nadia Marcinkova. \nThe agreement was negotiated in part by New York heavyweight criminal defense attorney Gerald Lefcourt. \nOn its first draft in September 2007, it required that Epstein pay an attorney - tapped by the U.S. Attorney's Office \nand approved by Epstein - to represent some of the victims in civil suits they had filed against Epstein. That \nattorney is prominent Miami lawyer Bob Josefsberg. \nFormer prosecutor Johnson said he has never seen a provision like that before. \nBut an addendum to the agreement signed the following month struck Epstein's duty to pay Josefsberg if he and the \nvictims did not accept a settlement and instead pursued litigation. \nThe agreement, signed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Maria Villafana, does not expressly state whether any victims \nwere contacted or consulted before the deal was made. \nAttorney Brad Edwards of Fort Lauderdale, who represents three of the young women, believes that none of the \nbetween 30 and 40 woman identified as victims in the federal investigation were told of the deal. Edwards said his \nclients were still receiving letters in the mail months afterwards saying the U.S. Attorney's Office assuring them \nEpstein would be prosecuted. \n\"Never consulting the victims is probably the most outrageous aspect of it...\" Edwards said. \"It taught them that \nsomeone with money can buy his way out of anything. It's outrageous and embarrassing for United States \nAttorney's Office and the State Attorneys Office.\" \nEpstein now faces many civil lawsuits filed by the women, who are represented by a variety attorneys. In many, the \nfacts alleged are the same: that Epstein had a predilection for teenage girls, identified poor, vulnerable ones and \nlured them to his home via other young women. The teens describe ascending a staircase lined with nude \nphotographs of young girls and to the spa room where Epstein would appear in a small towel. \nFormer Circuit Judge Bill Berger, who represents one of the victims, and The Palm Beach Post sought the \nunsealing of the agreement. Berger refers to it as a \"sweetheart deal.\" \n\"Why was it so important for the government to make this deal?\" Berger asked rhetorically. \"We have not yet had \nhonest explanation by any public official as to why it was made .. and why the victim's were sold down the river.\" \nFormer federal prosecutor Ryon McCabe described the agreement as \"very unorthodox.\" Such agreements, he said, \nare usually reserved for corporations, not individuals. \nhttp://www.palmbeachpost.com/ pbcwest/content/local_news/epaper/2009/09/18/0918epstein.html \nSEARCH \n® Site 0 Web Web Search by YAHOO! \nObarna Launches Mortgage Relief Plan \nIf you owe  less than S720 000 on .._„•-c,,Jr \n_ mortgage,you_probably c Jalify for the  \nPresident's Making Home Affordable  \nProgram.

I've never seen or heard of the procedure that was set up here.\" said McCabe, who has no \ninvolvement in any Epstein litigation and is now a securities litigation attorney. \n\"He's essentially avoiding federal prosecution because he can afford to pay that many lawyers to help those victims \nreview their cases.... If a person has no money he couldn't be able to strike a deal like this and avoid federal \nprosecution.\" \nThe back-room deal with federal prosecutors all the more interesting in light of the legal heavyweights who have \nworked for Epstein, including Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz and Kenneth Starr of Clinton impeachment fame. \nLefcourt is a past president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. \nEpstein's local defense attorney, Jack Goldberger, issued a statement Friday saying he had fought the release of \nthe sealed agreement to protect the third parties named there. \"Mr. Epstein has fully abided by all of its terms and \nconditions. He is looking forward to putting this difficult period in his life behind him. He is continuing his long \nstanding history of science philanthropy...\" \nEpstein ended up avoiding federal charges, and pleaded guilty in state court to felony solicitation of prostitution and \nprocuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution. In July 2008, he was sentenced to 18 months in jail, and \nlater allowed out up to six days a week on work release. \nEpstein left the jail in late July 2009 after serving not quite 13 months of the sentence, having earned gain time for \ngood behavior. \nPalm Beach Police began investigating the \"international moneyman of mystery,\" as the New York magazine \ndubbed him, after they received a complaint from a relative of a 14-year-old girl who had given Epstein a naked \nmassage at his home on the Intracoastal Waterway. \nPolice sought and found in poor neighborhoods a variety of tall, thin, model-like young women, who told stories of \nbegin recruiting, then going to Epstein's home and massaging and stimulating him. They walked away with between \n$200 and $1,000. \nThe investigation triggered tensions between police and prosecutors, with then-Chief Michael Reiter saying in a \nMay 2006 letter to then-State Attorney Barry Krischer that the chief prosecutor should disqualify himself. \n\"I continue to find your office's treatment of these cases highly unusual,\" Reiter wrote. He then asked for and got \nthe federal investigation that ended in the sealed deal. \n\"The Jeffrey Epstein matter was an experience of what a many-million-dollar defense can accomplish,\" Reiter told \nthe Palm Beach Daily News upon his retirement. \nhttp://www.palmbeachpost.com/pbcwest/content/local_news/epaper/2009/09/18/0918epstein.html \nRick \nHeidy Vero \nAudrey \nGabriel \nDebra Robin \n• \nJeffrey Katie Jodie \nRecent Activity \nLogin \nYou need to be logged into Facebook to \nsee your friends activity \nCerabino: Florida House GOP's 'uterus' \nban: A free-speech battle is born \n1,518 people shared this. \nLIForeclosure crisis: Fed-up judges crack \ndown disorder in the courts \n207 people shared this. \nFacebook social plug in \nPOSTPIX » Latest news photos \nMAGES OF WAR in Iraq Massive earthquake and \nand Afghanistan tsunami devastate Japan \nJeri Muoio Sworn in as Severe weather in Central, \nMayor South Florida \nIDo Your Feet Hurt?  \nSELBY SHOES \n561-969-9369 \nWe'Ll Put Wow!

Although Edwards and his victims have seen the \nagreement, Edwards says in his pleadings that the government has \"inaccurately described the agreement ... \ncreating a false impression that the agreement protects the victims.\" \nU.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra ruled that the claims, even if true, haven't damaged Edwards' case. \n\"If and when such alleged mischaracterizations become relevant to an issue to be decided by the court, the parties \nwill be given the opportunity to advance their positions and the court will resolve the issue,\" he wrote. \"If disclosure \nof the agreement will be required for the court to resolve this issue, appropriate disclosure will be ordered.\" \nSeeking to keep the agreement sealed, Assistant U.S. Attorney Dexter Lee argued that the agreement is not part of \nany case before Marra. \n\"The non-prosecution agreement has never been filed under seal in federal court,\" he wrote. \nHe also denied that the agreement has been inaccurately described. \nMarra sided with Lee on the argument that the agreement was not filed in federal court \"under seal or otherwise.\" \nOn Aug. 14, Marra ruled that the non-prosecution agreement would be unsealed for Edwards and any of the victims \nwho want to see it. But the ruling bars Edwards and anyone else who sees the document from disclosing the terms \nto anyone else. \nIn his motion to unseal, Edwards said he wants to be able to discuss the terms of the agreement with other victims \nand their attorneys as well as with other victims' rights groups such as the National Alliance of Victims' Rights \nAttorneys. \nThe desire to discuss the agreement with third parties is not justification for unsealing the document, Marra ruled. \n\"If a specific tangible need arises in a civil case relief should be sought in that case,\" he wrote. \nEpstein, 56, is serving 18 months in jail for soliciting prostitution and procuring a minor for prostitution. \nUnder the agreement, federal prosecutors will defer their decision on whether to prosecute Epstein on federal \ncharges until 90 days after Epstein completes all requirements of his state sentence. \nIf he abides by all court conditions and restrictions, the federal case would be dropped. \nIn addition to the state criminal case, there are nine federal and seven state lawsuits pending against Epstein. \nAll contain similar allegations: The Manhattan money manager, through his employees and assistants, brought \nminor girls to his Palm Beach home at 358 El Brillo Way for erotic massages and sometimes sex. \n(3 Site 0 Web \nSEARCH \nWeb Search by YAHOO! \nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE \nSPECIALIST \nBusy Physical Therapy office \nseeks FULL TIME AR Collection \nperson to handle txttient accounts. \nClit'k \nApply! \nEXPERIENCE PREFERRED \nCOLUMNISTS AND BLOGGERS \n111 \nMOST POPULAR \nFRANK CERABINO \nRead Frank's latest columns \nand follow him on Twitter. \nRead more \nHOT CELEBRITY NEWS \nGet the latest on South Florida \ncelebrities, billionaires, \npoliticos, more.

A.1 \nLENGTH: 557 words \nHEADLINE: JUDGE TO RULE ON SEALED PLEA-DEAL PAPERS TODAY \nBYLINE: MICHELE DARGAN, MICHELE DARGAN, Daily News Staff Writer \nBODY: \nA circuit judge will decide today whether the public will be privy to the federal government's non-prosecution deal \nwith Jeffrey Epstein, which was sealed when the convicted sex offender pleaded guilty in June 2008 to two felony \ncounts. \nEpstein, of Palm Beach, will be released from the Palm Beach County Stockade July 22, after serving less than 13 \nmonths of his 18- month sentence for procuring a minor for prostitution and solicitation of prostitution. \nTeri Barbera, spokeswoman for the Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office, confirmed his release date Tuesday. \nEpstein's projected release date had been Sept. 24, but gain time -- which includes his participation in a \nwork-release program -- moves the date up to July 22, Barbera said. \nEpstein, 56, has been in the work-release program since Oct. 10, in which he is allowed out of the stockade six days \na week, from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., to go to his West Palm Beach office, the Florida Science Foundation, monitored by an \nankle bracelet and accompanied by a deputy. \nAs part of Epstein's state plea agreement, the U.S. Attorneys Office agreed not to prosecute Epstein on federal \ncharges as long as he fulfills all requirements of his sentence and probation. The federal non-prosecution agreement has \nbeen under seal in state court. \nEpstein's attorney Jack Goldberger filed court papers asking that the documents stay sealed for the following rea-\nsons: \"to prevent a serious imminent threat to the fair, impartial and orderly administration of justice; to protect a com-\npelling government interest; to avoid substantial injury to innocent third parties and to avoid substantial injury to a party \nby disclosure of matters protected by a common law and privacy right, not generally inherent in these specific type of \nproceedings, sought to be closed.\" \nFort Lauderdale-based attorney Brad Edwards represents three Epstein victims and has asked Circuit Judge Jeffrey \nColbath to unseal the federal agreement to the public. An attorney for The Palm Beach Post also has asked that the rec-\nords be unsealed. \nEdwards and his clients have seen the agreement after a federal judge ruled that they are allowed to see it. But that \nruling bars Edwards and anyone else who sees the document from disclosing the terms to anyone else. \nEdwards said he wants to use that document \"in the deposition of various material witnesses\" relative to his cases. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013421 \nPage 2 \nJUDGE TO RULE ON SEALED PLEA-DEAL PAPERS TODAY Palm Beach Daily News June 25, 2009 Thursday \nRadaronline.com has reported that Epstein has \"secretly been helping the feds unravel a Ponzi scheme\" related to \nthe June 2008 indictment of two former managers of Bear Stearns Mortgage Investment Fund. \nEpstein's rep, Howard Rubenstein, confirmed last year that Epstein is \"Major Investor No. 1\" in the indictment, \nwhich says he lost about $57 million. \nGoldberger could not be reached for comment. \nThe Manhattan money manager has been incarcerated since June 30, when he pleaded guilty to the two felony \ncounts. As part of the plea agreement, Epstein must serve one year of house arrest after his release and register as a life-\nlong sex offender. \nIn addition to the criminal case, there are more than a dozen civil lawsuits -- both state and federal -- pending \nagainst Epstein. All contain similar allegations: Epstein, through his employees and assistants, brought minor girls to his \nPalm Beach home on El Brillo Way for erotic massages and sometimes sex. \nmdargan@pbdailynews.com \nGRAPHIC: Caption: Epstein To be released from jail July 22. \nLOAD-DATE: September 1, 2010 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013422 \nHeiress quizzed in sex suits - NYPOST.com \n4/6/1 1 1:5 1 PM \n1lAt 51 0 Today's Paper Login Register Classifieds E Archives Subscribe \nNEW YORK POST \nLast Updated:Wed., Apr. 6 \nNews \n2011, 01:45pm \nBERGDORF GUDDMAN \nDerek Jeter Carmelo Anthony Jay-Z Donald Trump \nPhrase-y Charlie \nHe wants to leave his mark --\non your wallet.

A grand jury indicted \nEpstein on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution. \nEpstein, who pleaded guilty and did 12 months in prison, was \ndeposed last week in the offices of his lawyer, Jack \nGoldberger. \nGoldberger wouldn't comment, but a friend of Epstein said, \n\"These [people bringing the complaint] are the lowest of the \nlows in terms of ambulance-chasing lawyers.\" The trials are \nscheduled to start in February. \nNadia Marcinkova, who has been described as Epstein's \nlesbian sex slave and who visited him behind bars 67 times, \nhas also been served with a subpoena. \nEpstein's brother, Mark Epstein, who has a real-estate \nholding company in New York, has already been deposed \nabout a building he owns, 301 E. 66th St. \"Jeffrey rents \nseveral apartments there where he keeps his girls, alleged \nmodels for the MC2 agency he owns,\" Edwards said. \"But \nMark acts like he doesn't even know his brother.

The public should be outraged it \nhas gone as far as it has.\" \nBrad Edwards, a second attorney representing the women, has seen the sealed deal after a federal judge allowed \nhim and his clients to view it, but would not discuss its contents. \nEdwards would say only that the women were \"outraged\" that it had been negotiated behind their backs. \nA reporter asked Edwards whether he thought Epstein received special treatment by federal prosecutors. \n\"Are you kidding? Its transparent. Certainly, no one else gets treated like that,\" Edwards said. \nEpstein, 56, a reported money manager of billionaires, is serving an 18-month sentence in the Palm Beach County \nStockade after pleading guilty almost a year ago in state court to felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring teen-\nagers for prostitution.

A.1 \nLENGTH: 561 words \nHEADLINE: EPSTEIN PLEA DEAL TO REMAIN SEALED FOR NOW \nBYLINE: DAVID ROGERS, DAVID ROGERS, Daily News Staff Writer \nBODY: \nThe plea deal that part-time Palm Beacher Jeffrey Epstein agreed to several months ago to avoid federal charges \nwill remain sealed for the time being. \nLawyers for The Palm Beach Post and a woman who claimed Epstein solicited and procured her for sex at his El \nBrillo Way home while she was underage asked Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Jeffrey Colbath Wednesday morning \nto unseal the plea documents immediately. \nInstead, Colbath decided to leave the documents sealed and give Jack Goldberger, the attorney representing Ep-\nstein, until 1 p.m. Friday to file papers showing why the records should remain out of public view. \nColbath agreed to let the Post and \"E.W.\" have standing in the case and set a hearing on whether the documents \nshould be unsealed for 1:30 p.m. June 25. \nEpstein agreed in September 2007 to plead to state charges to avoid federal prosecution, Goldberger told County \nJudge Deborah Pucillo at Epstein's plea conference last year. \nThe sealing of the records in question was said to be a \"significant inducement\" for Epstein, who is serving 18 \nmonths in the Palm Beach County Stockade -- with daytime release -- and is facing several civil lawsuits in state and \nfederal courts by more than a dozen alleged victims. \nColbath said, \"I don't see where any of the proper procedures to seal the documents were ever followed ...\" but that \nhe would give Epstein's legal team the ability to \"jump through the hoops to seal the documents if they are entitled in \nfact to be sealed.\" \nThe sealing of court documents in Florida is unusual and lawyers typically have to prove a significant reason for it, \nsuch as protecting trade secrets or a compelling government interest. \nGoldberger said after the hearing there is no rush to unseal the plea deal. \n\"I think the records clearly need to be sealed and continue to be sealed but I think the ruling by Judge Colbath was a \nvery well- reasoned practical decision,\" Goldberger said. \"He is not getting special treatment.\" \nBrad Edwards, of the law firm of Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler of Fort Lauderdale, said the plea deal should be a \npublic record. His firm represents the woman, now 20, who was identified only as E.W. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013428 \nPage 2 \nEPSTEIN PLEA DEAL TO REMAIN SEALED FOR NOW Palm Beach Daily News June 11, 2009 Thursday \nWhether procedure was followed is not the issue, he said. \n\"Certainly it should be unsealed regardless. I mean this is a very unusual circumstance where a document like this \nwould be sealed,\" Edwards said. \"None of the other criminal defendants in there (Judge Colbath's courtroom) had their \nplea bargains, plea agreements, their non-prosecution agreements, sealed.\" \nEdwards said his firm represents three women who claim they were procured for sex with Epstein when they were \nunderage. The three are outraged that the document is under wraps, Edwards said. \nDeanna Shullman, the attorney representing the Post, said the public and the press have a constitutional right of ac-\ncess to public records in Florida. \n\"Fortunately, the status quo is openness. So I think the judge has the idea that the initial closure was done without \nany adherence to those procedures but was inclined to give Mr. Epstein's lawyers additional time to prove that they \nshould be sealed in accordance with these procedures,\" Shullman said. \nIts a little disappointing in that we would have liked to see the judge unseal the record because that's what should \nbe the status quo in a situation like this, Shullman said. \ndrogers \n@pbdailynews. com \nLOAD-DATE: September 1, 2010 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013429 \nPage 1 \n0 ,  LexisNexis' \n1 of 11 DOCUMENTS \nCopyright 2009 Associated Newspapers Ltd. \nAll Rights Reserved \nThe Evening Standard (London) \nDecember 24, 2009 Thursday \nLENGTH: 824 words \nHEADLINE: CITY SPY \nBODY: \nEXPECT more media firms to announce plans to charge for content online in early 2010.

This \nweek, City Spy recounted how Epstein had transferred the title deeds of his prized 2003 Ferrari 575M Maranello to his \nprivate pilot Larry Visoki, prior to the car going on sale for $159,000 (£99,000) (possibly to help Epstein pay his legal \nbills). It turns out, the same Visoki was deposed last week by Bradley Edwards, an attorney for three of the women su-\ning Epstein. Questioned by Edwards about plane passengers who might have witnessed Epstein in the company of \nyoung girls, Visoki admitted Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, former Colombian \npresident Andres Pastrana Arango, Obama economic adviser Lawrence Summers, billionaire Ron Burkle, and actors \nKevin Spacey and Chris Tucker had been on board the plane while young girls were present. Fortuitously for Epstein, \nhowever, Ferrari-selling Visoki swore on oath that he never suspected his boss of having sex with them. \nOf course not, Larry. Now drive off into the sunset. \nMore on Prince Andrew, our special representative for international trade and investment.

To me, its \nmore spectacular what's not in it. Its the U.S. Attorneys Office saying well do everything in our power to see he doesn't \nget punished.\" \nEdwards has been fighting for a year in federal and state court to unseal the agreement. \n\"The non-prosecution agreement raises more questions than it answers,\" said Miami attorney Adam Horowitz, who \nrepresents seven victims. \"Why did all the co-conspirators receive immunity? Why were the victims not consulted re-\ngarding the sentence? Why did he receive such a minimal sentence? \nThe federal deal has remained sealed in Epstein's state court file since he pleaded guilty in June 2008 to state \ncharges of procuring a minor for prostitution and soliciting prostitution. \nU.S. Attorneys Office does not comment \nThe federal charges he could have faced were: conspiracy to persuade minor females to engage in prostitution, \nconspiracy to travel to engage in illicit sexual conduct with minor females, persuading minor females to engage in pros-\ntitution, traveling to engage in illicit sexual conduct with minor females and causing a person under 18 years to engage \nin sex for money while knowing they are underage. \nThe charges carry various statutory penalities ranging from 10 years to life, with a minimum mandatory of at least \n10 years. \nAlicia Valle, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorneys Office in Miami, declined comment. \nExpert: Feds take few sex-assault cases \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013432 \nPage 2 \nATTORNEY FOR EPSTEIN VICTIMS: 1 HAVE NEVER SEEN A STRANGER CASE Palm Beach Daily News \nSeptember 20, 2009 Sunday \nNorth Palm Beach criminal defense attorney Barry Maxwell said he is not surprised that federal charges weren't \nfiled. \n\"My experience has been that the federal government does not intervene in sex-assault cases, except if were deal-\ning with a serial rapist or it crosses jurisdictional lines,\" Maxwell said. \"Ifs either not a big enough case or not atrocious \nenough for them.\" \nEpstein, 56, served 13 months of his 18-month sentence at the Palm Beach County Stockade and received liberal \nwork-release privileges while in jail. He was able to go to his West Palm Beach office six days a week for up to 16 \nhours a day. \nHe is now serving one year of probation at his Palm Beach mansion and is registered as a lifelong sex offender. \nEpstein 'fully abided' by deal, says defense \nEpstein's attorney Jack Goldberger released the following statement: \"This document relates to allegations that \nwere made many years ago. It was by its provisions and agreement of the parties to remain confidential in part to protect \nthe identities of collateral third parties. \n\"Mr. Epstein has fully abided by all of its terms and conditions. He is looking forward to putting this difficult peri-\nod of his life behind him. He is continuing his longstanding history of science philanthropy both here in South Florida \nand nationwide.\" \nGoldberger had blocked the unsealing by filing court papers asking that the documents stay sealed \"to prevent a se-\nrious imminent threat to the fair, impartial and orderly administration of justice; to protect a compelling government \ninterest; to avoid substantial injury to innocent third parties; and to avoid substantial injury to a party by disclosure of \nmatters protected by a common law and privacy right, not generally inherent in these specific type of proceedings, \nsought to be closed.\" \nCircuit Judge Jeffrey Colbath ordered the agreement to be unsealed in June, but Epstein's attorneys appealed the \nruling to the Fourth District Court of Appeals, which affirmed Colbath's ruling. Colbath had ruled that the federal \nagreement -- sealed in state court -- was improperly sealed. \nfelt it was my fault' \nMore than a dozen lawsuits against the billionaire money manager have been filed in federal and state court, all \nwith similar allegations: that a minor girl was taken to Epstein's mansion on El Brillo Way and led upstairs to a spa \nroom by one of Epstein's assistants, where he would ask the girl to perform massages and/or various sex acts, for which \nhe would pay her. \nOne victim, who is known as Jane Doe #5 in a federal court lawsuit against Epstein, said she didn't find out about \nthe deal until after it was finalized. She was 15 at the time one of her schoolmates told her she could make $200 by giv-\ning a massage to a man in Palm Beach. \nShe says she was \"nervous and scared and wanted to leave\" once she got to Epstein's spa room. \n\"I thought, 1 can't call my dad or my mom because Pm stuck in this situation and didn't know what to do,\" she said. \n\"I really didn't know what this man was capable of For a long time, I felt like it was my fault and that's exactly what he \nwanted me to feel.\" \nEpstein has curfew \nWhile he is serving the 12 months of house arrest at his Palm Beach home, Epstein must observe a 10 p.m. to 6 \na.m. curfew, have no unsupervised contact with anyone younger than 18 and not view, own or possess pornographic or \nsexual materials. \nThe indictment followed an 11-month investigation by Palm Beach police, who said Epstein paid five underage \ngirls for massages and sometimes sex at his El Brillo Way home. Then-State Attorney Barry Krischer declined to pros-\necute Epstein on multiple charges involving unlawful sex acts with minors. Instead, he brought the case to a grand jury, \nwhich charged Epstein on the lesser charge of soliciting prostitution. \nThen-Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter wrote Krischer a letter asking him to recuse himself from the case. \nWhen that didn't happen, Reiter requested an FBI investigation to determine if any federal laws were broken. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013433 \nPage 3 \nATTORNEY FOR EPSTEIN VICTIMS: 1 HAVE NEVER SEEN A STRANGER CASE Palm Beach Daily News \nSeptember 20, 2009 Sunday \nOut of the ordinary' \nWest Palm Beach criminal defense attorney Gregg Lerman said several aspects of the Epstein case are unusual. \n\"I don't understand why it would be a federal case in this circumstance, and why was there anything in writing at all \nand why did they seal the agreement?\" Lerman said. \"Why did it go to the grand jury instead of through the state filing \nlewd assault charges?

In a move that looked like panic, the security forces used\nlive fire against the protesters -- and have continued to do so. By the\nend of April, over 550 people had been killed in different locations\naround the country, while many more were wounded and possibly\ntwo thousand arrested. With little reliable information coming out of\nSyria it is impossible to be certain of the figures. The state used\nparticular violence against Daraa, a poor city in an agricultural region\nwhich has suffered from government neglect and crippling drought in\nrecent years. As if to punish it for initiating the troubles, tank fire was\nused to quell the protests and something like a siege put in place.\nElectricity and water were cut off and food became scarce.\n\nThe deaths in Daraa and elsewhere -- and the emotional funeral\nprocessions that followed -- have clearly aroused great rage in the\npopulation and a thirst for revenge.

In our view, a Republican sweep would\nfirst lead to JPY strength on risk aversion, but eventually be the most bullish outcome for\nthe USD/JPY. The price action last week – a shallow dip – tells us two things about the\nUSD/JPY. First, the view that a GOP sweep would boost the USD/JPY was probably more\nwidely shared than we had thought, so a dip failed to stretch. Second, there may be\nmore potential USD/JPY buyers than sellers, which is in stark contrast to last year, when\nthere were many more potential USD/JPY sellers than buyers (Case for a stronger yen in\n2016 18 December 2015). The “buy-on-dip” cycle in USD/JPY is likely to continue as we\nexpect the pair to reach 115-120 by end-2017. We remain constructive about Japanese\nequities and see banks, insurance continue outperforming REITs near-term.\nInvestment Strategy\nJapan\nShusuke Yamada, CFA >>\nFX/Equity Strategist\nMerrill Lynch (Japan)\n+81 3 6225 8515\nshusuke.yamada@baml.com\nPaul Ciana, CMT\nTechnical Strategist\nMLPF&S\n+1 646 855 6007\npaul.ciana@baml.com\nHigher US rates (esp. if steepening) to boost USD/JPY\nUSD/JPY performs best at the time of UST bear-steepening as better risk sentiment\nreduces the JPY’s safe haven demand and a wider yield spread increases the USD\ndemand from Japanese investors (Exhibit 2). For our US strategists, the clean sweep\nmeans fiscal easing and higher rates, supporting their higher real rate view (A win for\nbond bears and USD bulls 09 November 2016). The USD/JPY has recently tracked real\nyield spread closely (Chart 1), and the pair is gradually producing higher carry as\nmonetary policy is diverging between the US and Japan (Chart 2). In Japan, fiscal easing\nis also a possibility in light of reduced odds of TPP implementation and a potential early\nsnap election. Any positive impact of Japanese fiscal easing on growth is likely to\nmanifest itself in higher inflation expectations under the BoJ’s yield-targeting regime,\nwhich means Japanese real interest rates can actually fall.\nUnauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited. This report is intended for amanda.ens@baml.com\nWatch Abe-Trump meeting – coordination or conflict?\nGiven the high uncertainty, clarifications on Trump’s policies on trade and currency will\nbe important for the Japanese market going forward. A potential Abe-Trump meeting in\nNew York this Thursday (17 Nov), as reported by Japanese media, warrants attention. We\nsuggested that Trump presidency could potentially reduce flexibility of Abe's political\nand diplomatic strategy, reduce positive market risk from Japanese politics, and increase\nnegative risk from Japan's national security. But this is not known until we see actual\nTrump presidency. If the President-elect shows an understanding for the existing Japan-\nUS alliance and refrains from protectionist rhetoric, it could reduce concerns about\ndeterioration of the bilateral relationship, supporting USD/JPY and potentially exporter\nshares (though reduced odds of TPP implementation is unlikely to change drastically).\nTrading ideas and investment strategies discussed herein may give rise to significant risk and are not\nsuitable for all investors.

This is the opposite of the situation some months ago (USD/JPY’s\ndownside risk to 110 – sell on rally 10 February 2016). First, CFTC speculative position\nremains yen long though short-term traders are probably positioned for the upside\nalready (Chart 3). Second, we believe domestic activity to raise hedge ratio has run its\ncourse as the USD/JPY swept through the sensitive level this year. As 2HFY16 (Oct ‘16-\nMar ‘17) has started, most life insurance companies are reportedly inclined to increase\nexposure to unhedged foreign bonds though they generally remain price sensitive. In our\nview, this is reflected in the USD/JPY’s consolidation during Tokyo trading hours after\nthe pair hit 100 on the Brexit vote (Chart 4). The fact that USD/JPY has failed to break\n100 multiple times since then suggests the market looking for USD/JPY’s dip, light\npositioning, and the market’s judgment that USD should be more expensive than 100\nJPY. The market is probably more vulnerable to the USD/JPY’s upside than downside.\nChart 3: CFTC non-commercial futures position (bln USD)\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n-20\nEUR GBP CHF CAD NZD AUD JPY\nNov '15 Nov '16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nChart 4: USD/JPY cumulative % change by trading zone\nDuring Japan Trading Hour(8am-4pm Tokyo)\n% GOP\n6\n4\n2\nNY Hour (0am-8am Tokyo)\nLondon hour (4pm-12pm Tokyo)\nsweep\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n-8\n-10\n-12\n-14\n-16\n-18\n-20\nBrexit\n-22\nNov-15 Jan-16 Mar-16 May-16 Jul-16 Sep-16 Nov-16\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nTechnical: constructive\nDaily overbought momentum (RSI) is overall a positive for USD/JPY’s uptrend.\nOverbought conditions can persist longer in uptrends, but at some point this could\n2 Japan Macro Watch | 14 November 2016\nreverse.

The insurance sector has been the best performer since the US election on the\nback of a steeper US Treasury curve and higher rates. Michael Hartnett observes\n“violent rotation out of deflation to inflation plays”, including a move from REITs to US\nbanks. This should apply to Japan, where banks and insurance have underperformed\nREITs amid relentless fall of the long-term yield and introduction of negative interest\nrate by the BoJ (Chart 5). The domestic policy condition has changed, however, as the\nBoJ is now reluctant to cut rate as it pays greater attention to the health of the financial\ninstitution. The BoJ now intends to prevent the yield curve from flattening excessively.\nWhile higher foreign yields may not lift yen rates as the BoJ controls the 10-year sector,\nreflationary environment outside Japan at least reduces the risk of a deeper cut at home.\nOutperformance of Japanese equities at the time of UST bear steepening has\nhistorically been led by cyclicals, banks and insurance (Exhibit 2). David Gleeson is\ncautious about REITs, while Futoshi Sasaki is constructive on banks. The move can\nstretch further near-term.\nExhibit 2: US Treasury curve (2s10s) move and market performance (past 43 quarters simple average, %) – USD/JPY, Japan equity (local ccy term), and Japanese cyclical, bank,\ninsurance tend to outperform at the time of UST bear-steepening\nUSDJPY\nDollar\nindex\n(DXY)\nMSCI\nJapan\nMSCI\nJapan /\nex Japan*\nJapan sector*\nDiscretion\nFinancials Materials\nary\nIT Industrials Energy Telecom Staples Utilities\nHealth\ncare\nBear steep 4.12 -0.60 8.58 3.32 11.68 9.97 9.96 9.46 8.58 5.88 3.27 2.86 2.83 1.89\nBear flat 1.90 0.31 3.88 0.58 3.49 -0.44 5.44 4.09 3.88 4.26 3.66 2.34 -0.06 5.21\nBull steep -1.85 -0.35 -2.32 -2.76 -3.03 -2.44 -4.70 -4.22 -2.32 -3.46 2.44 1.44 -3.64 -0.47\nBull flat -4.49 1.26 -7.31 -5.05 -8.91 -11.10 -9.94 -8.23 -7.31 -9.61 -0.37 -1.50 -4.16 -1.59\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nUsed Bloomberg Treasury yield index.\nCurve movements defined based on 2yr move (up or down) and 2s10s move (up or down) so these include twist movements, but even if we exclude these, implications for USDJPY and Japan equity do not change\nsignificantly.\n11 quarters of bear steepening = average 16bps increase in 2yr yields and 33bps 2s10s steepening; 10 quarters of bear flattening = average 26bps increase in 2yr yields and 20bps 2s10s flattening; 10 quarters of bull\nsteepening = average 48bps decline in 2yr yields and 28bps 2s10s steepening; 12 quarters of bull flattening = average 27bps decline in 2yr yields and 30bps 2s10s flattening\nJapan / ex-Japan = MSCI Japan / MSCI Kokusai ratio\nJapanese sectors follow MSCI definition\nChart 6: If inflation, rates surprise to upside, Japanese banks likely to outperform REITs\n2.3\n2.1\n1.9\n1.7\n1.5\n1.3\n1.1\n0.9\n0.7\n0.5\nNov-06 Nov-07 Nov-08 Nov-09 Nov-10 Nov-11 Nov-12 Nov-13 Nov-14 Nov-15 Nov-16\nBank/Reit\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n4 Japan Macro Watch | 14 November 2016\n3 risks – reality vs hope, higher yields, politics\nThe biggest risk to our view is that actual US fiscal easing turns out to be minimal. But\nwe believe the USD/JPY’s move will be quicker than whatever reality emerges in coming\nmonths. China’s unexpected RMB devaluation or any explicit rhetoric to guide USD\nweakness by the new US administration could eventually trigger significant JPY strength.\nThe other risk is a rapid increase in US long-term yields triggers risk-off trade,\nsupporting Japanese yen. However, we believe a potential correction in US equity is\nunlikely to reverse the medium-term direction of USD/JPY (though it could cause a\nshort-term pullback as our technical analysis suggests) because higher yields and\nUSD/JPY are backed by fundamentals for now –prospect for fiscal easing. Finally, politics\nis a significant concern. The President-elect has previously criticized the Japan-US\nsecurity alliance. A shift away from the Japan-US security alliance could lead to higher\ngeopolitical risk for Japan. It could also lead to more defense spending and expansion of\nJapanese military capability and could lift prospect for fiscal expansion. A combination\nof higher geopolitical risk and defense spending is probably less bearish USD/JPY than\nJapanese equities.\nJapan Macro Watch | 14 November 2016 5\nDisclosures\nImportant Disclosures\nFUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating.

But as you may know, it is a topic of considerable public debate, and \nseveral governments have been investigating the owners of such accounts. \nThere are a number of ways such accounts and also offshore trusts have been used to avoid inheritance tax, \nUK domestic tax, or tax imposed by other countries. Such accounts have also been used to launder money. \nWe have seen records held in the US identifying you among those who have held accounts. These accounts \ncontained assets of up to USD 3.5m, and include: \nHSBC (Suisse) SA \nFAMILY INTEREST L.P. \n22079 \nBESSIE \nJEFFREY EPSTEIN \n1) You may therefore have been a person evading or avoiding tax, or laundering money. \nWe will be particularly concerned with these questions: \n2) Why you had Swiss accounts. \n3) How much back tax you have settled with the tax authorities following their investigation of your affairs. \nAdditionally, from public records and from material we have seen we note that: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030593 \n4) In 2008 you pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and procuring minors for prostitution. You were \nsentenced to 18 months in prison. \n5) Your above accounts were also linked with Mr Leslie Wexner. \n6) You are known to be or have previously been closely associated with Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and Kevin \nSpacey. \n7) You have made substantial contributions to the Clintons' philanthropic causes. Tax reform campaigners \nhave previously been critical of those who engage in public life or the political process while avoiding or \nevading tax. Hilary Clinton herself, speaking in 2012, noted the importance of elites paying a substantial share \nof tax: \"One of the issues that I have been preaching about around the world is collecting taxes in an \nequitable manner — especially from the elites in every country.\" \nIt is intended shortly to publish the results of our survey in both the US and the UK. \nAs responsible journalists acting in the public interest, we would first like to give you the opportunity to \ncomment. \nIf we do not hear from you by 18:00 on Monday 12th January 2015 (preferably by email to \nwe shall proceed on the basis that you do not wish to comment on or amend \nour information. \nBut we have approached you in a straightforward fashion and hope you will take this opportunity to respond \nif you wish. Your substantive responses to each of our numbered points will be carefully considered and \npublished if appropriate. \n(For the avoidance of doubt, we do not normally regard any generalised assertion of \"inaccuracies\" as a \nsubstantive response; nor any generalised statement that the holders acted on advice. Neither will we regard \nas substantive any comment that only refers to the present state of affairs and not to the past.) \nWe are, of course, happy to discuss directly any concerns you may have. \nWe would be most grateful if you would acknowledge receipt of this letter.

He not only wanted to take full credit for stealing files from the NSA but\nhe wanted to escape any American retribution for his act. His decision suggests to me a highly-\nintelligent, carefully calculating man who was hell-bent on finding a new life for himself in a\nforeign country. There is a common thread that runs through these four choices. It is a\nwillingness to do whatever was necessary to achieve this new life, including disregarding his oath\nto protect secrets and instead transporting them on thumb drives to a foreign country. To protect\nhimself, he was also willing to rely on the influence of an adversary intelligence services in Hong\nKong and put himself of the hands of Russian authorities in Moscow. He also was willing to use\nsome of his classified documents as a medium of exchange, if not bait, with journalist to get the\npublic attention he sought. These choices paid off for him. The video presentation he partly\nauthored changed his status in the eyes of the public from a document-stealer to whistle blower.\nAgainst all odds, Snowden succeeded in transforming himself from a low-level computer\ntechnician working, without any public recognition at the NSA into an internationally-acclaimed\nspokesman against the NSA’s surveillance. And in Moscow, he could enjoy a safe life, free from\nthe threats of a CIA rendition team dropping from the sky or extradition proceedings. He was\nnow under the protection of Putin’s Russia. As far as Snowden was concerned, as he told\nGellman of the Washington Post on December 21, 2013 in Moscow, “The mission’s already\naccomplished.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020368\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

For Christians, and particularly for those\nwho believe in the underpinnings of the Judeo-Christian West, I don’t believe that we\nshould have a bailout. I think the bailouts in 2008 were wrong. And I think, you look in\nhindsight, it was a lot of misinformation that was presented about the bailouts of the\nbanks in the West.\n\nAnd look at the [unintelligible] it. Middle-class taxpayers, people that are working-class\npeople, right, people making incomes under $50,000 and $60,000, it was the burden of\nthose taxpayers, right, that bailed out the elites. And let’s think about it for a second.\nHere’s how capitalism metastasized, is that all the burdens put on the working-class\npeople who get none of the upside. All of the upside goes to the crony capitalists.\n\nThe bailouts were absolutely outrageous, and here’s why: It bailed out a group of\nshareholders and executives who were specifically accountable. The shareholders were\naccountable for one simple reason: They allowed this to go wrong without changing\nmanagement. And the management team of this. And we know this now from\ncongressional investigations, we know it from independent investigations, this is not\nsome secret conspiracy. This is kind of in plain sight.\n\nIn fact, one of the committees in Congress said to the Justice Department 35 executives, I\nbelieve, that they should have criminal indictments against — not one of those has ever\nbeen followed up on. Because even with the Democrats, right, in power, there’s a sense\nbetween the law firms, and the accounting firms, and the investment banks, and their\nstooges on Capitol Hill, they looked the other way.\n\nSo you can understand why middle class people having a tough go of it making $50 or\n$60 thousand a year and see their taxes go up, and they see that their taxes are going to\npay for government sponsored bailouts, what you’ve created is really a free option. You\nsay to this investment banking, create a free option for bad behavior. In otherwise all the\nupside goes to the hedge funds and the investment bank, and to the crony capitalist with\nstock increases and bonus increases. And their downside is limited, because middle class\npeople are going to come and bail them out with tax dollars.\n\nAnd that’s what I think is fueling this populist revolt. Whether that revolt is in the\nmidlands of England, or whether it’s in Middle America. And I think people are fed up\nwith it.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029056\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Also of interest is the fact\nthat impulsive aggression is more likely to arise when individuals are drunk than sober. Alcohol, as we all\nknow, lowers our inhibitions, but also lowers glucose in both the brain and body. Though scientists such\nas Baumeister and DeWall have not yet worked out in detail how glucose is used or replenished in the\ncontext of self-control, there are far too many studies using different methods and subjects to ignore this\nrelationship. Minimally, these studies indicate that we should think about self-control like a resource,\nsomething that can be used up and replenished, something that can be depleted, tipping the scale toward\nviolence.\n\nOne of the interesting implications of DeWall’s work is that individual differences in glucose\navailability are coupled with individual differences in self-control. Diabetes shows a high level of\nheritability, meaning that some individuals are more likely to develop this problem than others simply\nbased on what genes they receive from their parents. The prevalence of diabetes is on the rise in many\ncountries, with some estimates suggesting that by 2025, there will be 325,000,000 diabetics world wide,\nmore than double current estimates. The genetic disorder that lowers glucose levels arises because of a\ndeficiency in a key enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase. This is one of the most common\nenzyme deficiencies in the world, affecting over 400,000,000 people, and in many cases, triggered by the\nconsumption of fava beans. As with variation in the frequency of MAOA, so too can variation in this\nglucose-related gene be subject to selection pressures, especially given its link to violence. Once again,\nwe see nature and nurture contributing to individual variation and cultural differences in our capacity to\nharm others.\n\nTogether, these observations of glucose-related disorders speak to a disconcerting reality: we are\nborn with inherent differences in the availability of key resources guiding self-restraint. Some of us start\noff life better equipped to control our frustrations, wait for future gains, and moderate our temper. These\nearly differences can have long lasting and disastrous effects later in life, a point supported by a study that\nbegan forty years ago with four year-old children presented with a marshmallow.\n\nThe American social psychologist Walter Mischel recruited four year old children to his\n\nlaboratory and sat them down at a table with two objects: a marshmallow and a bell.

We remember that boycotts had been employed widely\nduring the McCarthy period. The threat to boycott motion-picture studios and television stations\nthat employed “red,” “pink,” or “suspect” actors, directors, or technicians, led to the notorious\n“black lists” and “red channels.” In an interview with Playboy magazine, I had expressed some of\nthose concerns:\n\n“Take what [some of these] women are now doing and ask yourself the question. Would\nyou favor it if their objection were to books about atheism or communism instead of\npornography? If you would say no, then it seems to me that you can’t be in favor of a\nboycott against stores that sell Playboy and Penthouse, because they’re equally protected.\n\nThe dispute between civil libertarians and feminists had split the ranks of some liberals, and the\nissue was achieving some notoriety in the media. I had, perhaps, added some fuel to the fire by\nmy criticism of the “new feminist censors” in several articles and speeches. I did not deny that\nsome pornography could be degrading to women, but I argued that it is precisely the function of\nthe First Amendment to protect those whose speech offends and degrades.\n\nI pointed out that some of the most vocal opponents of pornography inadvertently provided the\nmost compelling arguments for its constitutional protection by characterizing it as “Fascist\npropaganda.” (The Fascists, not surprisingly, used to call it “Communist propaganda.”) All\npropaganda is within the central core of the First Amendment. Nor did I dispute the claim that\nsome pornography may contribute to an atmosphere of violence against women. But speech\noften causes undesirable consequences—political violence, riots, even revolutions. That should\nnot, I argued, be a reason for suppressing speech itself.\n\nSome radical feminists went beyond boycotts, shooting bullets through a bookstore window in\nHarvard Square to protest its sale of Playboy Magazine. Some theaters showing Deep Throat\nreceived threats of violence, and at least one was firebombed after the patrons left.\n\nSome of the women of Quincy House who were opposed to Deep Throat were not content to\nprotest. First they tried to cancel the showing by calling for a vote of the students who lived in\nthe dormitory. They lost by a margin of three to one. Forty-nine percent of the women who\nvoted opposed the showing; and forty-eight percent favored showing Deep Throat. Next they\ntried to get the Harvard University administration to forbid the scheduled showing. The Dean of\nStudents wrote a letter to the Quincy House Film Society urging it not to show Deep Throat, but\nhe would not ban it. The members of the film society, caught up in the adversary challenge by the\nfeminists, voted to go forward with the event.\n\nThe Quincy House women, with the assistance of other feminists, decided to picket the\nperformances and to use the occasion to sensitize students to the evils of pornography. I\nsupported their protest. Pamphlets were prepared presenting the feminist perspective on\npornography. A slide show, graphically depicting the exploitive and sexist nature of pornography,\nwas scheduled for presentation in an adjoining room an hour before the first showing of Deep\nThroat. Several prominent local feminist speakers had been asked to address the hundreds of\nprotesters expected in front of Quincy House on the evening of the first scheduled performance.\n\n[12\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017199\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The\ndevastating conclusion — a fundamental failure of the institution itself— echoed throughout campus and\ndemoralized Baylor Nation. An operational failure of the highest order had been identified, with\nprofound impacts on victims and their families.\n\nThe “other side of the story” was left untold. Campus safety — and the safety of our students in all\nrespects, including freedom from interpersonal violence — was a high priority throughout my years of\nservant-leadership. The idea that Pat Neff Hall was oblivious to student-safety concerns was belied not\nonly by common sense and basic human decency, but refuted by the facts.\n\nHere, in brief, is the other side of the story. Indeed, iln the fall of 2010, the EC round table focused\nspecifically on issues of student safety arising out of a Department of Education (Office of Civil Rights)\ninvestigation into a tragic student death at Eastern Michigan University. OCR’s compliance review\n(under Title IX) was prompted by an on-campus student -death. A 22-year old student at EMU was\nfound dead in her residence hall after having been sexually assaulted and brutally beaten. The\ngovernment’s devastating report issued in November 2010. The EC promptly determined to establish a\nBaylor Student Safety Concern Task Force to examine all issues relating to student safety, including but\nby no means limited to interpersonal violence.\n\nThe Task Force had an outstanding group of members. Five student leaders, including Michael Wright\n(student body president) joined with the then-Chief of Police, Jim Doak, and EC member Kevin Jackson\n(Vice President for Student Life), and other key staff members to begin their work early in the new\nsemester (January 2011). The Task Force held on-campus hearings. Broad participation was invited.\n\nIn the meantime, additional voices were raised across the nation. As the Baylor Task Force was\noperating at full speed, 16 Yale students filed a complaint with respect to the campus climate prevailing\n“under the elms” of New Haven. One particularly disturbing incident included a ribald Yale fraternity\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031536\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Some were operational. It is true we ended up overcoming Palestinian\nand Syrian resistance. Given the numerical balance of forces, that was a\nforegone conclusion. But with all the attention paid to the political aims of the\ninvasion, we’d never sufficiently planned for operating against a wholly\ndifferent kind of enemy than in our previous wars, and on a wholly different\nkind of terrain. Huge columns of Israeli armor had found themselves stuck on\nthe winding roads of central Lebanon, running low on gasoline, vulnerable to\nrelatively small ambush squads. In some instances, a dozen Palestinian fighters\nor Syrian commandos had halted the best-armed, best-trained, tank forces in the\nMiddle East for hours on end. Overall, the pattern of past wars had been broken.\nEven in 1973, once the surprise attacks had been turned back, Israeli forces had\nadvanced, attacked and broken enemy resistance. That hadn’t happened here.\n\nThere was a deeper problem as well. At the start of the conflict, Begin had\ndeclared, boastfully almost, that this was Israel’s first “war of choice.” That\nwasn’t true. Both 1956 and 1967 were wars of choice. Yet those preemptive\nattacks, especially in the Six-Day War, were in response to a sense of strategic\nthreat that was commonly understood by almost all Israelis. There was a sense\nnot just of consensus, but national unity. This war was different. It had been\nlaunched in pursuit of a specific political vision: a marriage of Begin’s political\ncredo and Arik’s determination to use overwhelming force to bulldoze a new\npolitical reality in Lebanon.\n\nThe findings of the inquiry commission were published in February 1983.\nThey were all the more powerful for the forensic language used. The inquiry did\nconcede Begin’s point: it was Gemayel’s men who had actually done the\nkilling. But it said that the Israel1 commanders’ decision to allow the\nPhalangists into the refugee camps “was taken without consideration of the\ndanger — which the makers and executors of the decision were obligated to\nforesee as probable — that the Phalangists would commit massacres.” The\ncommission added that “when the reports began to arrive about the actions of\nthe Phalangists in the camps, no proper heed was taken. The correct conclusions\nwere not drawn. No energetic and immediate action was taken to restrain the\nPhalangists and put a stop to their actions.”\n\nArik bore personal responsibility for this, the report said.

What I said about diagnosis is also true of planning. We\nplan in everything we do. There are economic plans, architectural\nplans, medical treatment plans, business plans, and so on. A computer\nprogram is a type of plan, and research plans are everywhere in a\nuniversity. Writing these plans is not so different in principle, but in\nreality a business plan doesn’t look much like a treatment plan. So\nthere is the idea of a good plan and the understanding of what a plan\nlooks like, what a plan’s description ought to be like, in any area of\nlife. You may think a business plan should look a certain way, but if\nthe business community has a different idea, that idea will turn out\nto be right.\n\nStudents should have the opportunity to write all kinds of plans,\nlearning about the principles of planning while learning about what\nofficially is considered to be a good plan in an area of the real world\nthat interests them.\n\nSo, as part of the second year, students should get to study plan-\nning, and then study successful planning documents, and then write\nplans and have them evaluated by the faculty.\n\nCausation. Who studies causation? Everybody. Psychologists\nworry about what makes people crazy, doctors worry about what\nmakes people sick, environmentalists worry about what is ruining\nthe planet. Physicists want to know how the world works. Computer\nscientists want to know how computers can work better. Engineers do\nnothing but causation, really. So, here again, determining causes is a\nbasic cognitive skill and it can be learned within the second year as\nwell, in the same way I have been describing building on what came\nin the first year to tackle complex problems of causation in areas that\ninterest the students.\n\nSocial Processes\n\nDescribing can easily be taught, as all of the eight processes dis-\ncussed above are taught by requiring students to present their work in\nwritten and oral form. Students need to learn to write but they also\nneed to learn to talk and to use alternative media to make their points\nand to explain what they have done. A coherent course of study in\nhow to describe properly is easily within the ability of any college fac-\nulty and ought to be its highest priority, taught from many different\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023912\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Or, as in South\nAfrica, that a change in nuclear policy might come from a change in régime in\nTehran. Yet realistically, we couldn’t count on either. And there was no doubt in\nour minds that a nuclear Iran represented a hugely serious threat. If the Shi’ite\nMuslim regime in Iran did get a nuclear weapon, Sunni Arab states like Egypt and\nSaudi Arabia, and Turkey as well, would try to go nuclear. Neither they nor we\ncould assume that Iran was developing a bomb as a mere act of deterrence. We\ncouldn’t exclude the possibility that, especially in a crisis threatening the survival\nof the ayatollahs’ rule, Iran would use the weapons it was developing. It could\neven send a nuclear device in a container smuggled on board a commercial vessel\ndocking in one of Israel’s ports.\n\nWhile few in Israel disputed the seriousness of the threat, a number of top\npolitical and military figures had deep misgivings about military action. Given the\nneed for secrecy, most of our discussions took place within the so-called Group of\nEight, often also including the chief of staff and other top generals from the kirva.\nBoth Dan Meridor and Benny Begin, Menachem Begin’s son and a minister\nwithout portfolio, were opposed to an Israeli attack from the start. They were\nconvinced that the implications for the region, and for our relations with the wider\nworld, were difficult to predict and potentially dire. Dan raised a further concern.\nHe feared an Israeli attack might actually intensify Iran’s effort to get a nuclear\nbomb, only now with political cover, because it would argue it was acting in self-\ndefense. The view of those opposed to an Israeli strike was that we should rely on\nAmerican economic and political pressure to deal with the threat. And, if that\nfailed, on American military action.\n\nIn November 2010, the internal debate came to a head, at a meeting involving\nthe Group of Eight as well as the chief of staff, the head of military intelligence\nand the commander of the air force. We convened in a villa that the Mossad kept\nfor clandestine foreign visitors, near the coastal road north of Tel Aviv. The\nmeeting began with a presentation by the generals of our attack plan. There was\nstill a core of ministers opposed: chiefly Dan Meridor and Benny Begin, but also\nBoogie Ya’alon, a former Sayeret Matkal commander and chief of staff who\nMinister of Strategic Affairs. But the confidence and detail with which the plan\nwas laid out, and the fact that Bibi, Lieberman and I were in favor of being\nprepared to act, gave me the sense that a majority would back military action if it\nbecame necessary.

But the rea/ reckoning\nover 1973 was about to come. It would change Israel beyond recognition, with\nrepercussions still being felt today. It would dramatically alter the course of my\nlife as well.\n\nI still remember the moment it hit home, on the evening of May 17, 1977. As\nNava and I watched in our tiny living room in Ramat Hasharon, Chaim Yavin,\nthe anchorman on the country’s only TV channel, was handed an exit poll from\nIsrael’s latest national election. He began with three words: Gvirotai verabotai,\nMahapakh. “Ladies and Gentlemen, a revolution.” For the first time since the\nstate was declared, Israel’s government would not be in the hands of David\nBen-Gurion or his Labor Zionist heirs. Our next prime minister would be\nMenachem Begin, who had inherited the mantle of Jabotinsky’s Revisionist\nZionism. He’d headed its youth wing, Betar, in eastern Europe, and led the\nIrgun Zvai Leumi, the main right-wing militia force before 1948. Lacking the\nintellectual depth and subtlety of Jabotsinky —a liberal intellectual who, among\nother things, translated Dante into Hebrew — Begin drew his political strength\nfrom his powerful oratory, and a refusal to countenance any compromise in\nsecuring what he viewed as the ultimate goal: a Jewish state in all of biblical\nPalestine, from the Mediterranean to the Jordan River, with whatever military\nforce was necessary to secure and sustain it.\n\nBut perhaps Yavin should have used a different metaphor in his dramatic\nelection-night broadcast: reidat adamah, an earthquake. Begin’s victory, after\nthe loss of eight straight elections over three decades, was the culmination of\nseismic rumblings which had been building for years. The big, decisive, shock\nwas the 1973 war. Yet this was not just because of the colossal intelligence\nfailure, or the myriad errors of our military commanders and political leaders. It\nwas the fundamental loss of trust in the cosy, self-perpetuating establishment\nthat had dominated all aspects of Israeli politics, society and culture from the\nstart: Palmachniks like Rabin and Dado; political players like Golda and\nShimon Peres; Haganah veterans like Dayan and Bar-Lev; and, of course, the\nkibbutznik pioneers.

There is no smoking gun beyond the often flagrant, custom-\nbreaking, events of the President's 16 months in office. Indeed, much of\nthe evidence is based on the President's public statements and tweets\nabout those events. \"This indictment could have been drafted without\nanyone being interviewed,\" said one source. This is, from the\nperspective of White House sources good news: the case then, is just an\nissue of what motives are ascribed to the President's behavior—\nbehavior that is, the President's supporters believe it is easy to show,\nimpulsive and not thought out. Hence no intent. For the Mueller team, it\nis precisely that careless behavior and flagrant disregard for\nconstitutional standards that they hope-to put on trial.\n\nAccording to a source involved in the Mueller strategy, the plan to\nindict the President is now \"more advanced\" than it was when the terms\nof the indictment were agreed earlier in the year. In the intervening\nmonths, the president’s lawyers, spokespersons and surrogates have\nstaged a very public debate about whether such a legal proceeding\nwould be constitutional—in effect trying to discredit, ahead of time, any\nprosecutorial action the Special Counsel’s office might take. This may be\na preemptive response to an indictment they expect is forthcoming. It\nmay also be an effort to pressure Rosenstein. It may even be an effort to\nconvince Mueller of that, since some in the White House believe that\nthat the plan to indict is not a strategy yet embraced by the whole\nSpecial Counsel’s office, but one that is being advocated only by its most\nvirulently anti-Trump purists on the investigative team—most notably\nby the number two lawyer under Mueller, Andrew Weissmann.\n\nIt may be noteworthy that there appears now not to be plan for an\nindictment related to collusion, although, legal experts say, that could\ncome later and may depend on new information from the investigation\nof the President's personal attorney, Michael Cohen. It is also possible\nthat alternative plans have been made—preparation for more expansive\nindictments, for instance, or for a broader report that would include the\nallegations of obstruction but not seek to indict the President.\n\nThe White House view is that without the underlying collusion\ncharge—\"real collusion,\" in the words of one White House advisor, “and\nnot just a bunch of Facebook ads and some trolls\"—Mueller will be\npresenting a weak and politically-motivated case. \"That's a witch hunt,\"\nsaid the advisor.

The selection is top-\nnotch, with some 173 exhibitors on board, including most of the top dealers you’d expect.\n\nMORE, MORE, MORE\nMuch more is going on, including big events like the launch of Ai Weiwei’s Turbine Hall installation at Tate\nModern. We, however, prefer to focus on some of the freakier offerings.\n\nOr what about the The Museum of Everything in Primrose Hill, which was \"regarded as the most successful new\naddition to the Frieze scene last year\" (according to the Independent). For the third exhibition at the space,\nopening Oct. 13, Pop art pioneer Peter Blake curates a show of \"outsider\" art and artifacts, including pieces by\nMorton Bartlett, James Castle, Henry Darger and Martin Ramirez. During Frieze Week, contemporary art stars\nlike Bob & Roberta Smith, Polly Morgan and Jeremy Deller are scheduled for various tours and talks at the\nMuseum. Worth a swing by.\n\nThen there is the mysterious House of the Noble Man, Oct. 12-20, at 2 Cornwall Terrace, an 18th-century building\noff Regent’s Park, near Frieze. What exactly this show is remains unclear, but it is some kind of conceptual selling\nexhibition, sponsored by the Russian billionaire who owns the property, and curated by artist Wolfe von\nLenkiewicz with Russian curator Victoria Golembiovskaya. Lenkiewicz, for his part, describes it as \"a curatorial\nconcept playing with the idea of commerce, mirroring the [art] market with irony.\" The Art Newspaper reports\nthat some £20-million in art will be for sale, including works by Picasso and Cézanne, as well as a selection of\nworks from Charles Saatchi’s \"New Sensations 2010\" roster of emerging artists, and the holdings of the lraqi-born\nindustrialist Ragdan El-akabi.\n\n13\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028293\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We have no shared\npicture of the world as it might be. You. Me. Our leaders. None of us. And the\nexperience of other, fast-collapsed empires should way on us. “The struggle to\nsurvive,” the historian John Darwin has written of the British Empire, “was waged in\nan age of revolution: a Eurasian revolution that cumulatively (but very quickly)\ndestroyed almost all the global preconditions on which the British system had\ndepended since the 1830s.” So in our age. Many of the essential determinants of\nAmerican power are being revolutionized by new, connected forces. The world syste\nwill change in coming years. Our only question is will the changes reduce us as they\nonce shrunk Britain, or will we draw on them to establish a longer, more durable\nsystem. At the moment, in a time of fascinating explosions of ideas and insights and\nconnection, the American foreign policy approach is deeply and strangely unplugged\nfrom these risks and possibilities. The world has changed - is changing profoundly -\nfrom the one in which most students and practitioners of international affairs were\neducated. And here’s the reality: Nothing can stop this change. The last two decades\nhave brought massive and persuasive change in so many disciplines. And in foreign\npolicy? In the consideration of problems of war and peace which, if not handled\nproperly will rain tragedy on every other effort we might have in mind? Not much\nhas changed. Except this: A growing sentiment of pessimism that suggests maybe\nAmerica can’t hold on. Great powers get one century to rule, the logic goes, and\nAmerica’s is now up.\n\nIt’s not merely that we lack a “China Strategy” or a “Middle East Strategy”, it’s that\nwe've failed to discern an overall grand strategy that would produce a coherent\nanswer to the question of what to do about China or the Middle East - to say nothing\nof how those forces might be played off another with clever diplomatic harmony like\ninstruments in a symphony. It is hard to know if this puzzlement represents a failure\nof imagination or of nerve. Does it mark arrogance or confusion? Or just an\nignorance of the profound, revolutionary nature of the forces now at work?\n\nToday when leading officials remark that their main concern is a rising China or\nrevanchist Russia or that we live in a world where, as Secretary of State John Kerry\nsaid, “terrorism is the principal challenge,” they are missing the point. The\nfundamental threat to American interests isn’t China or Al Qaeda or Iran. It is the\nevolution of the network itself. Constructed of switches, chips, data, code, exploits,\nsensors, AI bots, financial instruments, trade, currency and more, the network is\nitself a weapons system. Its architecture, a wonderfully humming maze of change\nand contagion and instability, determines its terrifying dangers and marks its vast\nopportunities®. It touches - decisively - each and any particular problem we would\ncare to name.\n\n64 “The struggle to survive”: John Darwin, The Empire Project, (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 2009) 477\n\n65 Its architecture: For an excellent overview on the politics of contagion, see Tony\nD.

In his interview with the Globe, Dershowitz\n\nwouldn’t confirm or deny the account.\n\nThe atmosphere at Mar-a-Lago raises questions.

By providing Snowden\nwith this platform to rail against the surveillance practices of his adversaries, Putin laid claim to\nthe moral high ground in the Game of Nations.\n\nWhat remains missing from this picture is Snowden's motive in requesting documents from\nother foreign intelligence services, such as the GCHQ, and copying lists of NSA sources. It is\ndifficult to believe that his motive was conventional whistle-blowing since these documents were\nnot among those | he gave to journalists in Hong Kong. It will be recalled that his legal\nrepresentative in Moscow, Anatoly Kucherena, said that he taken to Russia, and had access to,\nNSA documents that he had not given to journalists. He had gone effort in his final weeks at the\nNSA to take documents that any adversary service would prize. Copying them was, as we have\nseen, part of his well-calculated plan. Did he use them, as he used the documents he gave to\nPoitras, Greenwald and Gellman, as leverage in his transformation? Since the role that Moscow\nmay have played in Snowden’s remarkable defection, while less visible than that of the movie-\nmakers, journalists and activist, cannot be ignored in this puzzle. Since it requires a closer\nexamination of the machinations that brought Snowden to Russia, I made arrangements to visit\nMoscow in October 2015.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020340\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

She\nsensed his need for a shoulder to lean on, a hand to hold at the movies or on a\nSaturday stroll on the beach. They made their apartment a home. The shelves\ncreaked under the weight of Yoni’s books. Often on a Saturday, when Nava and\nI dropped in to see them, an old 33 rpm record would be playing on the stereo.\nYoni would be sitting puffing on his pipe, reading, and smiling.\n\nBut outside this domestic haven, he still struggled. He had looked forward to\ncommanding Sayeret Matkal. But there was a growing distance between him\nand those he led, a kind of dissonance between these more typically Israeli\nyoungsters and the aloof, reflective, intellectual side of their commander. There\nwas another tension as well. Sayeret training was notoriously tough. Yoni\nearned the admiration of his men by participating personally in the most\ndifficult of the exercises. But just as he pushed himself to his limits, he insisted\nrelentlessly on seeing the same drive in them. This was a challenge all sayeret\ncommanders faced to some extent. I had, too. But a number of the officers had\ngone to the kirya to urge that Yoni be replaced. He knew this. Though I tried to\nreassure him, telling him that every sayeret commander was different, with his\nown strengths and weaknesses, he became only more determined to push\nhimself and those around him harder.\n\nNo we were in the final countdown for Entebbe.

He told me to get ready to fly not into Uganda, but to Nairobi. I'd\nbeen re-assigned to accompany a Mossad team to Kenya. Our first task would\nbe to get the answers to the questions Rabin had asked us. Then, we would be in\ncharge of arranging for the Kenyans to allow us to refuel the C-130s on the way\nout, and to set up a medical facility for any injured soldiers or hostages. During\nthe attempted rescue, I would also be the channel of communications from the\nNairobi side of the operation to Kuti, tens of thousands of feet above Entebbe in\na command 707.

As a result, he is required to register as a sex offender. While \nhe wasn't prosecuted for additional charges, more than 40 girls under the age of 18 say they \ncame to his home and gave him massages. During the massages, they say, he masturbated \nand sexually assaulted them. \nBrad Edwards and Paul Cassell, attorneys representing two of his alleged victims, say in \nthe filing that the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of Florida of deliberately \nmisled the victims by telling them there was an ongoing investigation into their claims. \nHowever, they say, the office was concealing the fact that they already had signed a \n-osecution deal with Epstein. \n-ding to the motion, the U.S. Attorney's office in January 2008 and May 2008 sent \"false notification\" letters in to \nin's alleged victims saying \"(t)his case is currently under investigation.\" However, the office had signed the agreement \nEpstein in September 2007. \nittorneys want a court hearing during which they will ask that the agreement be invalidated because it violated the \nis' rights. In the motion, the attorneys claim the agreement is illegal because the government did not protect the \nIressionally mandated rights of victims before it entered this agreement.\" \ndge grants the request, Epstein could be charged by the U.S. Attorney's office. If he were charged and convicted on \nal charges, he could be sentenced to 10 years to life for each charge. \n-ding to the motion, \"The only reason that the (U.S. Attorney's office) concealed the existence of the non-prosecution \nr'nent from the victims was not to comply with some legal restriction, but rather to avoid a firestorm of public \n)versy that would have erupted if the sweetheart plea deal with a politically connected billionaire had been revealed.\" \nValle, special counsel for the U.S. Attorney's Office Southern District of Florida, in an email to the newspaper that the \nkttorney's office will respond in court filings. \never, as we stated more than two years ago in July 2008 in our response to the plaintiffs' then-emergency petition for \ncement of the Crime Victim Rights Act, the CVRA was not violated because no federal charges were ever filed in the \nlem District of Florida,\" Valle said. \"Because the matter remains pending in court, it would be inappropriate at this time \nwide additional comment on the merits of the current motion.\" \nTC 1-1 DACTC• \nRemember me: (51 \nl[ \nJUSTJOBS] \nU.S. ATTORNEYS CHART (hteractivel \nii \nTrack leadership changes in the 93 U.S. Attorney \noffices, with Bush holdovers and Obama \ncandidates. \nCOVI NGTON \nCOVINGTON & BURLING LLP \nRecognized for its Leading \nWhite Collar Crime and \nAnti-Corruption Practices by \nChambers and Legal 500 \nDecisions about who, where and how \nto prosecute have always been—and \nmust remain—the responsibility of the \nexecutive branch.\" - Attorney General \nEric Holder discussing pressure from \nmembers of Congress to prosecute \nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed before a \nmilitary commission rather than in \nhttp:/ /www.mainjustice.com/2011 /03/22 /attorneys-say-miam i-prosecutors-violated-crime-victims'-rights-act/ \nPage 1 of 2 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013406 \nAttorneys Say Miami Prosecutors Violated Crime Victims' Rights Act I Main Justice 4/7/11 1:38 PM \nI \nfederal court. \nlama To Tap Non-Profit Head For DOJ Crime Victims Post \nwmakers Bemoan Lack of Funding For Victims' Rights \npsecutor Who Violated Rights of Islamic Groups by Accident is Now U.S Attorney \nmocratic Donor Violated Spirit of Election Laws, LA Prosecutors Say \nderal Prosecutors Violated Laws, Ethics Rules in 201 Cases Since 1998, Study Finds \nLDER POST NEWER POST \n'erez Asks States to Help Enforce ADA Protections for Facing Hiring Freeze, Kansas U.S. Attorney Wants More  \ntudents Lawyers  \nnents are closed \nle I About I Advertise I Jobs I Privacy Policy I Terms of Use \nDEPARTMENT NEWS \nSES \nAssociate Attorney General Tom Perrelli Speaks at \nthe Department of Educationa00s Gender-Based \nViolence Summit \nComverse Technology INC.

If that happens, it could open up the 58-year-old \nPalm Beach billionaire to a slew of federal charges involving sex \ncrimes with minors that were set aside by the agreement. \nThe motion, filed Monday in federal court in West Palm Beach, \naccuses the U.S. Attorney's Office of deliberately misleading the \nvictims by telling them the investigation was ongoing, while \nconcealing they had already signed a deal with Epstein. \nAccording to the motion, the U.S. Attorney's Office sent \"false \nnotification\" letters in January 2008 and May 2008 to the victims \nsaying \"(t)his case is currently under investigation\" after the \ngovernment had signed the agreement with Epstein in September \n2007. \n\"The only reason that the (U.S. Attorney's Office) concealed the \nexistence of the non-prosecution agreement from the victims was \nnot to comply with some legal restriction, but rather to avoid a \nfirestorm of public controversy that would have erupted if the \nsweetheart plea deal with a politically connected billionaire had been \nrevealed,\" the motion says. \nIf Epstein were found guilty on federal charges, statutory penalties \nranged from 10 years to life. \nInstead, the sealed pact was part and parcel of Epstein's \nacceptance of a state plea deal, where he received an 18-month \nsentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution and soliciting \nprostitution. He served 13 months segregated in a vacant wing of \nthe county stockade and was let out on work release six days a \nweek for up to 16 hours a day. \nEdwards and other attorneys fought in court for a year before \nsuccessfully getting the agreement unsealed in September 2009. \nMore than 30 minor girls were identified as Epstein's victims in the \nnact \nSite Q Web \n1.

They are \namong more than two-dozen underage girls who filed lawsuits or \nsettled claims against Epstein, alleging they were lured to his Palm \nBeach mansion to give him sexually charged massages and/or sex \nin exchange for money. \nThe motion filed Monday says the agreement is illegal because the \ngovernment did not protect the \"Congressionally mandated rights of \nvictims before it entered this agreement.\" \nAlicia Valle, special counsel for the U.S. Attorney's Office Southern \nDistrict of Florida, said in an e-mail that the U.S. Attorney's Office \nwill respond in court filings. \n\"However, as we stated more than two years ago in July 2008 in our \nresponse to the plaintiffs' then-emergency petition for enforcement \nof the Crime Victim Rights Act, the CVRA was not violated because \nno federal charges were ever filed in the Southern District of \nFlorida,\" Valle said. \"Because the matter remains pending in court, it \nwould be inappropriate at this time to provide additional comment on \nthe merits of the current motion.\" \nThe attorneys reference e-mails and letters from the federal office to \nEpstein's lawyers acknowledging the government's legal obligation \nto inform victims about the pact. The e-mails are redacted in the \nmotion because they are under seal. The attorneys filed a separate \nmotion Monday to unseal the correspondence. \n\"The reasonable inference from the evidence is that the U.S. \nAttorney's Office wanted to keep the agreement a secret to avoid \nintense criticism that would surely ensued had the victims and the \npublic learned that a billionaire sex offender with political \nconnections had arranged to avoid federal prosecution for numerous \nfelony sex offenses against minor girls,\" the motion says. \"As part of \nthis pattern of deception, the U.S. Attorney's Office discussed victim \nnotification with the defendant sex offender and, after he raised \nobjections, stopped making notifications.\" \nEpstein sought \"a higher level of review\" within the Department of \nJustice, the motion says. \"A reasonable inference from the evidence \nis that Epstein used his significant political and social connections to \nlobby the Justice Department to avoid significant federal \nprosecution,\" the motion states. \nShare this article: \nCOMMENTS \nComments are closed \nNEWS \tSOCIETY \tWEATHER \tARTS \tADVERTISE \tSPECIAL SECTIONS \nReligion \tInsider \tSPORTS \tArts Calendar \tSERVICES \tPalm Beach Life \nArchives \tSocial Calendar \tPolo \tOBITUARIES \tSubscriber Services \tHome & Loggia \nProfilePalmBeach \u000bMadoff \tFASHION \tWEF \tLIFESTYLES \tHelp & FAQ \tAutomotive & Yacht \u000bShowcase \nSpecial Reports \tFashion Calendar \tBUSINESS \tLocations \tVisitors' Guide \nTown Council \tAnnouncements \tReprints \tSeason in Review \nFeral Cats \tOPINION \tBLOGS \tFood \tStaff \tHurricane Guide 2010 \nPlaza \tLocal Voices \tCOLUMNISTS \tWorvenue \u000bth A \tPrivacy ic \u000bPol Y \tChamber of Commerce \nReach 8 \tLetters to the Editor \tPets \tAbout Us \tNewsletter \nHealth \tSubmit a Letter \tVisitor Agreement \u000bSubscribe \nREAL ESTATE \nhttp:/ /www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/attorneys-want-jeffrey-epstein-agreement-th rown-out-1338111.html Page 2 of 3 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013409 \nAttorneys want Jeffrey Epstein agreement thrown out 4/7/11 1:37 PM \nCopyright@ Thu Apr 07 13:33:34 EDT 2011 All rights reserved.

McKenna reserved ruling on whether the recording will be released to \nattorneys representing young women who were sexually abused by Epstein as minors. McKenna didn't \nlisten to the recording during the hearing. Fort Lauderdale attorney Brad Edwards and Utah attorney and \nlaw professor Paul Cassell are fighting to obtain the 22-minute tape on behalf of Epstein victim Jane Doe. \nShe has filed one of a dozen pending civil cases in federal court in West Palm Beach against Epstein. \nA status check is set for Thursday in those cases before U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra. \nDoe could have settled the lawsuit for $50,000 but is asking for $50 million in damages, Cassell said \nTuesday. \"Jane Doe was repeatedly sexually assaulted over a lengthy period of time by this wealthy and \npowerful man,\" Cassell said. \nEpstein, 57, is currently under house arrest in his Palm Beach home after serving 13 months of an 18-\nmonth state sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution and soliciting prostitution. Nearly two dozen \nyoung women have filed lawsuits against the billionaire money manager -- some already settled -- all \nalleging Epstein sexually abused them as minors at his El Brillo Way home. \nCites reporter's protected privilege \nRush, of the New York Daily News, was present in the courtroom, but did not have to testify Tuesday. \nNeither did Fort Lauderdale private investigator Michael Fisten, also in the courtroom. Working on behalf \nof Epstein victims, Fisten discovered the existence of the tape and had a conversation with Rush about its \ncontents. \nRepresenting Rush and the newspaper, Washington attorney Laura Handman and New York Daily News \nattorney Anne Carroll argued the tape should not be released under any circumstances, citing reporter's \nprotected privilege. Rush told Epstein the conversation was \"off the record\" and has never published any \nportion of that conversation. But even if portions had been printed, the unpublished portions would still be \nprotected, Handman said. \nHandman cited cases where interviews were conducted in the presence of other people and privilege was \nnot waived. \nIn addition, Handman argued that Rush should not have to testify in court. \nThe ability for reporter's privilege to be protected is crucial in culling sources and gathering information for \nnews stories, Handman said. Reporting is all about give and take between the reporter and the source; \nthat's what reporters have to do, Handman said. \n\"This is so critical to news gathering,\" Handman said. \"Mr. Rush could find himself testifying in [many] \ncases just because he had the temerity to do some reporting on a very important story.\" \nThere is nothing helpful to Doe's case on the tape and \"Jane Doe is not referred to once in that tape,\" \nHandman said. \nCassell argued that the tape is \"critical in showing Epstein's lack of remorse.\" \nCassell described Epstein as a pitiless sexual abuser to Jane Doe and at least 30 other minor girls. Even \nthough Jane Doe is not referred to by name on the tape, Epstein refers to his victims as \"the girls\" and \nmakes disparaging remarks about them on the tape, Cassell said. \nTape played for others \nCassell said privilege does not apply because it was waived when Rush played the tape for three people \nand verbally divulged its contents to two others, including Fisten and Edwards, who also represents two \nother victims. But even if there is \"qualified privilege,\" Cassell says, it is outweighed by Doe's inability to \nobtain the information anywhere else and the jury's need to hear Epstein's own words about his lack of \nremorse. \nSince Epstein has exercised his Fifth Amendment right during questioning by victims' attorneys, the jury \nClassifieds \nReal Estate \nAdvertise \nAutomotive \n,Ifisotp \nDLO\n/CI \nby \nShannon Donnelly \nhttp://nLnewsban k.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_doci...ername=dkiesq&s_accountid=AC0111040620221012261&s_upgradeable=no Page 1 of 2 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013411 \nPalm Beach Daily News: Archives 4/7/11 1:35 PM \nwill have no other way to hear Epstein's words in his own voice, Cassell said. \nDeadline for discovery in the Doe case is May 31, with the trial set for July 14. \nmdargan@pbdailynews.com \nCopyright (c) 2010 Palm Beach Daily News \nRefinance Rates at 2.650/0  \n$160,000 Mortgage for $659/mo.

Edwards represents Doe and two other Epstein victims. Edwards and Cassell are fighting to \nobtain the tape to further their case of sexual abuse by Epstein when Doe was a minor. \nEpstein, 57, was released from jail in July after serving 13 months of an 18-month state sentence for \nsoliciting a minor for prostitution and soliciting prostitution. Nearly two dozen young women have filed \nlawsuits against Epstein -- some already settled -- all alleging Epstein sexually abused them as minors at \nhis El Brillo Way home, where he is now serving house arrest. \nThe New York Daily News is seeking to keep the tape confidential, citing reporter's protected privilege. \nIn response, Cassell says the newspaper waived its protected privilege when Rush played the recording \nfor three people and described its contents to two others, including Edwards. \nIn addition, Cassell writes that privilege can't be applied in this situation because it doesn't involve an \nissue related to a confidential source. The person on the tape is Epstein. \nEven if there is \"qualified privilege,\" Cassell maintains it is outweighed by Doe's inability to obtain the \ninformation anywhere else and her \"compelling need to obtain Jeffrey Epstein's own words about his \nsexual abuse and lack of remorse.\" \nWhen reached by phone Wednesday, Anne Carroll, attorney for the New York Daily News, said she will \nanswer Cassell in a court filing. Both the New York Daily News and Doe have asked a federal court judge \nin Manhattan to listen to the tape in chambers to help determine whether privilege applies. \nEpstein and others who helped him procure minor girls for massages and sex acts have taken the Fifth \nAmendment in their depositions, stymieing Doe and the other victims suing Epstein, the documents say. \nMichael Fisten, an investigator working for Doe, discovered the existence of the tape in fall 2009. An \nauthor who had listened to the tape told Fisten that Rush had a tape recording of Epstein \"discussing the \nsexual abuse of minor girls.\" \nAccording to a sworn affidavit by Fisten, he called Rush, who confirmed he interviewed Epstein and made \na tape. According to Fisten, Rush told him that he compiled negative information from Epstein about his \nexploits with underage girls and how he eluded the justice system. But Fisten said that Rush told him that \nhis publisher, who knows Epstein, killed it after receiving a call from Epstein. \nFisten said Rush told him, among other things, that the following information was contained on the tape: \nThat Epstein said he went to jail in Florida for no reason and if the sexual abuse of minors had happened \nin New York, he would have only received a $200 fine. \nThat L.M., one of Edwards' clients who sued Epstein for sexual abuse as a minor, came to him as a \nprostitute and a drug user (meaning she came to him for sex, rather than him pursuing her). \nThat all the girls suing him are only trying to get a meal ticket. \nThat the only thing he might have done wrong was to maybe cross the line a little too closely. \nIn a sworn deposition, Edwards states that Rush disclosed much of the information contained on the tape \nto him in a conversation. \nEdwards said in his statement that the Rush interview is \"unique and not otherwise obtainable from other \nwitnesses because it can be used to prove perjury -- a federal crime. \nEdwards said Epstein testified in a deposition that he did not recognize the name George Rush from the \nNew York Daily News \"despite the fact that he gave a personal interview that we all now know to have \nbeen tape recorded.\" \nmdargan@pbdailynews.com \nStart or \nRenew Your \nSubscription \nThursday, April 7, 2011 \nSHINY SHOTS ADVERTISE \"NTACT US \nAdvertise \nAutomotive \nupdates in your e-mail \nSign up to receive \nour e-mail \nnewsletters here. \n- \nPalm Beach Daily News \nNEWSLETTERS \nSUBSCRIBE \nhttp://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_doci...ername=dkiesg&s_accountid=AC0111040620221012261&s_upgradeable=no \nPage 1 of 2 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013413 \nPalm Beach Daily News: Archives 4/7/11 1:32 PM \nEpstein \nHas 'come close to crossing a line.' \nCopyright (c) 2010 Palm Beach Daily News \nRefinance Rates at 2.650/0  \n$160,000 Mortgage for $659/mo.

Rape offenses have been\nrevised to eliminate resistance requirements, and many states also removed the requirement to prove use of force. !83 Evidence\nrules are now more favorable to sexual assault complammants: rape shield laws in all jurisdictions prohibit use of a complainant's\n\n184 hile evidence rules in federal courts and\n\npast sexual behavior as character evidence or a basis on which to infer consent,\nnineteen states permit evidence of the defendant's past sexual offenses to show propensity to commit sexual assaults. !8° Some\npolice departments have officers specially trained mm sexual assault investigations, and prosecutors’ offices (as required by\nstatute in some states) have specially trained units dedicated to sexual assault prosecutions. !°° Hospitals and [*899] social\nservice agencies likewise now have staff trained in forensic interviewing and evidence-gathering in the course of aiding assault\n\nvictims. 187\n\nthat the \"prosecutor ... shall confer with the victim in the case before pretrial diversion is granted ... [or] before amending or dismissing a\ncharge\").\n\n21 No rights of administrative review are specified in the state victims’ rights laws cited supra note 120.\n\n122 Five states place all their prosecutors within a single state agency, which at least potentially makes possible hierarchical oversight. In\nNew Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, and Alaska, local prosecutors are appointed by, and under the supervision of, the state\nattorney general. See Steven W. Perry, Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Dep't of Justice, Prosecutors in State Courts, 2005, at 2 (2006),\nhttps://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/psc05.pdf (noting Alaska, Connecticut, and New Jersey do not elect prosecutors; Delaware and Rhode\n\nIsland elect attorneys general who appoint all prosecutors; all other states elect prosecutors at the local level). Id. at 11. For an example of a\nstate attorney general's limited authority over locally elected prosecutors, see, for example,Va. Code § 2.2-5/] (2018).\n\n123 Equal protection and due process doctrines nominally empower courts to review charging decisions motivated by racial bias or retaliation\nfor exercising fundamental rights, and inquiry into selective charging implicitly requires examining biased declinations as well. But these\ndoctrines are wholly deferential to prosecutorial discretion. See United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 469 (1996) (holding that equal\nprotection doctrine bars racially biased charging); Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 607-08 (1985) (holding that due process bars\ncharging in retaliation for exercising fundamental rights); see also McCleskev v. Kemp, 48] U.S. 279, 312-314 (1987) (holding that statistical\nevidence of bias in death penalty administration insufficient to prove constitutional violation without proving purposeful discrimination in\n\ndefendant's case). For a classic account, see Kenneth Culp Davis, Discretionary Justice: A Preliminary Inquiry 188, 207-08 (1969) (\"The\naffirmative power to prosecute is enormous, but the negative power to withhold prosecution may be even greater, because it is less protected\nagainst abuse... .

The Department's investigative agencies provide such services to thousands of\n\nvictims every year, whether or not the investigation results in a federal prosecution. 7!°\n\nQuantifying the scope of this undertaking with regard to one federal investigative agency, the Department explained:\n\nThe [FBI] alone reports that it provided more than 190,000 services to victims during the past fiscal year [FY 2011], including\ncase status updates, assistance with compensation applications and referrals, and counseling referrals. From sexual assaults in\nIndian Country to child pornography and human trafficking to mass violence and overseas terrorism, FBI victim specialists\nprovide much-needed immediate and ongoing support and information to victims. The FBI addresses victim safety issues when\nneeded, providing on-scene response and crisis intervention services in thousands of investigations.

Since replicator\ndynamics cannot be solved in closed form, they must analyzed using computer simulations\nseeded with randomly chosen strategy frequencies. This method also requires restricting\nthe analysis to a few strategies. Therefore, we run our replicator analysis only on the\nrestricted set of strategies represented in figure 2. While this set of strategies is restricted,\nit includes the potentially destabilizing mutants discussed above.\n\nTo investigate the frequencies in which different equilibria emerge, we randomly seed\nthe strategy frequencies many times and record the frequency of each strategy after the\npopulation has stabilized. Many mixtures of strategies are behaviorally consistent with\nCWOL, for example, if a large enough fraction of player 2s exit when player 1s look then\nno player 1s will look, even if this fraction is less than 1. Thus, we classify population\nfrequencies as being behaviorally equivalent to ALLD, CWL, and CWOL (see appendix\nfor details). We plot the frequencies of each of these for different values of a in figure 3 (see\nappendix for analogous figures for other parameters). As can be seen, CWOL emerges\noften when it is a Nash Equilibrium.\n\nNext, we identify the conditions under which people will be most likely to avoid looking\nand detect looking amongst others. For this, we interpret the conditions under which\nCWOL is the only cooperative equilibrium, because, as we show in the appendix, when one\nallows for mutations, the CWOL equilibrium no longer emerges in dynamic simulations\nwhen both CWOL and CWL are equilibria. Recall that CWL is a Nash equilibrium if\nand only if -+, > cy. This equilibrium condition has a natural interpretation: in order to\nsustain CWL, the long term gains to player 1 from the ongoing relationship must suffice\nfor player 1 to cooperate even when player 1 knows the temptation is high in the current\n\nperiod. Contrast this with the condition that determines if CWOL is an equilibrium:\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026527\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Darren, if you want to call me and \nread me the highlights, I can type them on a Word Doc as you dictate...(?) (Even when Scott opened them on \nhis end he had no highlights) \nForwarded message \nFrom: Scott Denett \nDate: Sun, Apr 3, 2011 at 10:04 AM \nSubject: raw text \nTo: Lesley Groff < \nAccording to Friday's NY Post Jeffrey Epstein returned to New York City \"making wisecracks about his just-\nended jail stint for having sex with an underage girl\". \"I'm not a sexual predator, I'm an 'offender, ' \" the Wall \nStreet hedge fund manager told The Post. \"It's the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a \nbagel,\" said Epstein. \nWell that's not exactly the correct analogy... \nNot only are Epstein's comments brazen, they are arrogant and self-implicating. By telling a reporter \"I'm an \noffender\", he seems to be admitting guilt. \nWhich brings me to the big question of the day. Why did Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan D.A., allow a Level \n3 sex offender (the most dangerous kind) to reside -- even for ten minutes -- in a house that is right next to \nCentral Park and a school? Isn't that unlawful given the housing guidelines for sex offenders? \nAccording to the NYPost, Epstein's Level 3 designation means that he is at \"high risk\" to repeat his offense and \nposes \"a threat to public safety.\" \nWhen I rang Vance (twice) to discuss Epstein's residential guidelines he did not take my calls. \nAccording to a few of the attorneys who represented Epstein's victims in the civil cases, the financier never \nagreed to a psychological evaluation prior to or during his sentence, a requirement of all sexual predators. \nWhile Epstein's self-incriminating statements are published (this week he told the Post \"the crime that was \nsupposedly committed in Florida is not a crime in New York\" -- an interesting choice of words -- he continues \nto mock the law that applies to all other sex offenders who are found guilty of the same crime. \nEpstein served 13 months in the West Palm Beach Stockade and 18 months under community control (a rather \npermissive version of house arrest), for 2 Counts of Solicitation of Prostitution with a Minor. \nIn August of 2010, immediately following his release from \"community control\", Epstein returned to his $50 \nmillion East 71st Street town house given to him by his former client and long time friend Leslie Wexner. \nJust in the last few weeks he held a house warming dinner to celebrate his release from jail and reportedly \ninvited television reporters Katie Couric, Charlie Rose, George Stephanopoulus and his close friend, HRH \nPrince Andrew, according to the NY Post. \nYou would think these professional television reporters would have done their homework prior to accepting his \ninvitation no matter how desperate they were to rub elbows with Prince Andrew. \nAccording to a 53-page sealed indictment Epstein was facing 10 years to life on multiple counts of statutory \nrape, and child sex trafficking. \nCourt documents in that case claimed he routinely sought out girls as young as 14 and paid them $200 to $1,000 \nfor sexually explicit massages in his homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and Manhattan. \nIn the New York sex-offender database, Epstein isn't registered under a zip code rather a \"name search\" option \nthat does not list his New York address. \nThe reason for this is because Epstein's Upper East Side home is considered \"temporary\" and by NY state law, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029766 \nhe is required to provide only his permanent address to the database. \nEpstein is currently listed under his Florida home even though he is no longer a Florida resident either (after his \narrest he immediately became a US VI resident), but then again who's keeping count? \nOnce again these are mere technicalities when it comes to Epstein's sexual predator case. The two most \ndisturbing parts of this story are that this could easily happen again and that once again there will be no justice. \nHad Epstein been a caring benefactor contributing to society and these young girl's education and well being \nthen the world would have judged him differently. \nWhat he has done instead is the exact opposite -- causing enormous damage to hundreds of underage girls who \ncould have been sponsored towards a better education. \nWith respect to Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance, I'm confused by his decision to allow this sexual predator to live \nat his Fifth Avenue house all this time (since August 2010), given his rather tough stance on gun control as \nwitnessed by his testimony in Friday's NYPost when asked about a Florida driver cleared in a Manhattan \nweapon's charge, \"guns brought illegally into New York City\" he said, \" for any reason violate well established \nstate laws and are a threat to our public safety\". \nThen wouldn't a registered sex offender living 500 feet from a park (Central Park where young girls \ncongregate), and with resources to spare be an even more dangerous threat to society? \nThe Billionaire Pedophile's Sex Den \nby Conchita Sarnoff javascript:void(0) \n• javascript:;javascript:; \n• http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs- and-stories/2010-07-22/j effrey-epstein-pedophile-billionaire-and-his-sex-den/full/ \n• javascript:void(0) \n• javascript:void(0) \n• Email \n• javascript:void(0) \n• \nNewscom Hedge fund mogul and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who went free this week, lived in a \ndepraved world of thrice-daily massages, pornographic artwork, and hush money—that's only now \nbeing revealed. Conchita Sarnoff reports on the sordid details in part two of her exclusive exposé. Also: \n• Nude images of young girls were scattered around the house and the bathroom soap was shaped like sex \norgans \n• Staff trolled for fresh recruits to make sure Epstein had two or three massage appointments each day \n• The house manager has been sentenced to a longer prison term than Epstein—for trying to sell notes \nregarding massage appointments \n• Epstein gave $1 million to his friend Jean Luc Brunel when he was starting the modeling agency MC2 \n• According to a former bookkeeper, young girls were brought to the U.S. by MC2—often from Eastern \nEurope—then traveled on Epstein's private jets \nJeffrey Epstein's loyal friends say that his prosecution was unduly harsh, rather than outrageously lenient. \nThey insist that his sexual habits, although obsessive and unusual, were mostly legal and essentially harmless. \nAs the police records attest, the girls brought to El Brillo Way were routinely told they could \"say no\" at any \ntime during a massage as Epstein escalated contact in a step-by-step assault that was remarkably similar in \nevery victim's statement: First she would be asked to remove her shirt, then her pants. He would attempt to \nfondle her buttocks and breasts as he masturbated, then bring out a large vibrator. There was sometimes digital \npenetration, and the more willing girls were lured into full-blown sexual relations with both Epstein and Nadia \nMarcinkova, who was referred to in press accounts and police reports as Epstein's live-in \"sex slave.\" \nA former bookkeeper in the Miami office, who also arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S., confirmed \nthat MC2 girls became frequent guests on Epstein's private jets. \nIt's true that some underage girls may have lied about their age, and some came to the house voluntarily several \ntimes—although, according to Florida statutes, none of that has any bearing on the criminality of the contact, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029767 \nparticularly if the girl was 16 or younger. But what is particularly disturbing about this case—judging by \narrangements at the Palm Beach house—is that Epstein, a billionaire hedge-fund manager, organized his life \naround this sexual compulsion in an open and methodical way that suggests he felt he was beyond the law. \n• Conchita Sarnoff: Epstein Faces Sex Traffic Probe  \n• Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free  \nAccording to police who executed a search warrant, the house was decorated with large, framed photos of nude \nyoung girls, and similar images were found stashed in an armoire and on the computers seized at the house \n(although police found only bare cables where other computers had been). Some bathrooms were stocked with \nsoap in the shape of sex organs, and various sex toys, such as a \"twin torpedo\" vibrator and creams and \nlubricants available at erotic specialty shops, were stowed near the massage tables set up in several rooms \nupstairs. \nEpstein also enlisted his staff in the predatory activity, and four—Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, \nand Marcinkova—figured in the FBI investigation. The Non Prosecution Agreement stipulated that they would \nnot be charged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their \nother duties, worked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-daily \"massages\" was stocked with \nfresh recruits. Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, \nwho was for many years Epstein's live-in partner, also recruited young girls. \nSince his 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has settled more than a dozen \nlawsuits brought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a \nscheduled trial; each received well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net \nworth. \nThe victims told police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often \ngave them a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Rodriguez said in his sworn statement that a maid named \nLupita, who was a devout Catholic, wept when she complained to him about cleaning up after the massage \nsessions, picking up soiled towels and putting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein \nwith the pope hung next to one of him with a young girl. \nIronically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2004 and 2005, ended up being sentenced to more \njail time than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein's activities. He was fired, he says, \nfor inadvertently drawing police attention to one of the girls when she arrived at the house unannounced to \ncollect money. He saw an unfamiliar \"beater\" in the driveway one evening and called 911. When he left \nEpstein's employ, Rodriguez took away some notes and emails about massage appointments as \"protection\" \nagainst his own prosecution, and failed to produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department's initial \ninvestigation. \n• javascript:;javascript:; \n• http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs- and-stories/2010-07-22/jeffrey-epstein-pedophi le-billionaire-and-hi s-sex-den/full/ \n• javascript:void(0) \n• javascript:void(0) \n• Email \n• javascript:void(0) \n• \nUnable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell this \n\"golden nugget\"—his term—for $50,000, to be used in the victims' civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the \noffer to an undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with \"obstruction of official proceedings\" for \nwithholding information that could have advanced the criminal investigation of Epstein—which by that point \nhad been settled in a plea deal. Rodriguez was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison (Epstein was allowed to \nserve 13 months in the Palm Beach county jail), and now awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal \ncourt in Miami for transporting firearms, another deal he says he made to pay the bills after he lost his job. \nIn a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have $2,000 in cash \non hand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley Robson who \nbrought them to the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions to the Palm Beach Police \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029768 \nDepartment, and in return was given PBPD baseball hats to put on the dashboard of his various cars to avoid \nbeing stopped or ticketed by local police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his own deposition, \nacknowledged that, in addition to earlier donations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-\nheeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given the department $100,000 for some sophisticated equipment. \nThe police were still researching the purchase when Epstein came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the \nmoney returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein's local attorneys, told police that Epstein also gave $100,000 to \nthe Florida Ballet for massages, because he was \"very passionate\" about massages being \"therapeutically and \nspiritually\" beneficial. Yet victims told police they had no massage training.) \nPerhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein's relationship with Jean Luc Brunel, \nowner of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and Marcinkova \n\"deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly \ngirls under the age of 17, to engage in sexual play for money.\" (Which would amount to trafficking.) \nBrunel is a 50-plus French playboy who was formerly part owner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling agency. He \nlives in New York and South Beach, Florida, and owns 85 percent of MC2, which has offices in New York, \nMiami, and Tel Aviv. (The remaining 15 percent is owned by his partner, Jeff Fuller.) Brunel has been \nobserved as a house guest at Epstein's Palm Beach home and may well have had contact with him also in New \nYork, where Epstein owns a lavish home, and in Paris, where Epstein keeps an apartment on elegant Ave. Foch. \nCBS reporter Craig Pyes, who investigated Brunel for a 60 Minutes broadcast many years ago, is quoted in \nMichael Gross' book about the modeling industry, Model: The Ugly Business QfBeautiful Women. Pyes told \nthe author that Brunel \"ranks among the sleaziest people in the fashion industry. We're talking about a \nconveyor belt, not a casting couch. Hundreds of girls were not only harassed but molested.\" Now The Daily \nBeast has learned that Epstein had made a $1 million wire transfer to Brunel's offshore bank account in \nSeptember 2004, just as he was setting up MC2. Whether this was a gift or a loan or a backdoor investment in \nthe new venture is unknown. A French citizen who managed to avoid giving evidence in the Epstein \ninvestigation, Brunel declined to comment on any of this, as does Fuller. Asked in April of Brunel's activities, \nEpstein said \"I'm 100 percent convinced that he doesn't traffic children.\" (Brunel has never been charged.) \nAn American fashion designer who booked her girls through MC2 says they were very young and very \nbeautiful; many were from Eastern Europe and spoke little English.

What happened here to the justice \nsystem? \nConchita Sarnoff \nhttp://www.thedailyb...hile-  goes-free/ \nConchita Sarnoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 500 companies and has \nproduced three current events debate television programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut to Kabul, and a \nsegment for The Oppenheimer Report. She is writing a book about child trafficking in America. \nHedge fund mogul and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who went free this week, lived in a depraved world of \nthrice-daily massages, pornographic artwork, and hush money—that's only now being revealed. Conchita \nSarnoff follows up on her investigation of the legal wrangling that saved him from a long prison term and \nreports on the sordid details in part two of her exclusive exposé. Also: \n• Palm Beach's police chief objected to Epstein's \"special treatment\" and gave The Daily Beast an exclusive \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029769 \nlook at his nine-hour deposition about the investigation. \n• Earlier versions of the U.S attorney's charges, including a sealed 53-page indictment, could have landed \nEpstein in prison for 20 years. \n• Victims alleged that Epstein molested underage girls from South America, Europe, and the former Soviet \nrepublics, including three 12-year-old girls brought over from France as a birthday gift. \n• The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on Epstein's private jets, which would be evidence of \nsex trafficking—a much more serious federal crime than the state charges Epstein was convicted of \n• Epstein's attorneys investigated members of the Palm Beach Police Department, while others ordered private \ninvestigators to follow and intimidate the victims' families; one even posed as a police officer. \n• Then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told The Daily Beast that he \"would have instructed the Justice \nDepartment to pursue justice without making a political mess.\" \nFilm director Roman Polanski is not the only convicted pedophile to walk free this month and return to a life of \nprivilege. On Wednesday, hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completes his one-year house arrest in Palm \nBeach, which has been even less arduous than Polanski's time at a Swiss ski chalet. \nWatch Jeffrey Epstein Storm Out of a Deposition When Asked About His Penis \nDuring Epstein's term of \"house arrest,\" he made several trips each month to his New York home and his \nprivate Caribbean island. In the earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor-13 \nmonths in the Palm Beach Stockade—he was allowed out to his office each day. Meanwhile, Epstein has settled \nmore than a dozen lawsuits brought by the underage girls who were recruited to perform \"massages\" at his \nPalm Beach mansion. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each \nreceived well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth. \n• Conchita Sarnoff: Epstein Faces Sex Traffic Probe \n• The Billionaire Pedphile's Sex Den \nWith that, the known victims of Epstein's sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case against \nhim is closed unless new ones come forward. According to banking sources, he has been moving assets out of \nthe U.S. and may well follow Polanski into a luxurious exile. \nBut the question remains: Did Epstein's wealth and social connections—former President Bill Clinton; Prince \nAndrew; former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; and former Treasury \nSecretary Larry Summers were just a few of the prominent passengers on his private jets—allow him to receive \nonly a slap on the wrist for crimes that carry a mandatory 20-year sentence? Was he able, with his limitless \nassets and heavy-hitting lawyers—Alan Dershowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, Kenneth Starr, Guy Lewis, \nand Martin Weinberger among them—to escape equal justice? \nEpstein Faces Sex-Traffic Probe \nhttp://www.thedailyb...obref=obnetwork  \nThe Justice Department is investigating Jeffrey Epstein for child trafficking, The Daily Beast has learned—and \nhas widened the scope of its probe to include a famous modeling agency. \nHedge-fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completed his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor last week. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029770 \nBut it appears his problems may not be over. Now The Daily Beast has learned that: \n• Federal investigators continue to investigate Epstein's activities, to see whether there is evidence of child \ntrafficking—a far more serious charge than the two in his non-prosecution agreement, the arrangement \nbetween Epstein and the Department of Justice allowing him to plead guilty to lower-level state crimes. \nTrafficking can carry a 20-year sentence. \n• The FBI is also investigating Epstein's friend Jean Luc Brunel, whose MC2 modeling agency appears to have \nbeen a source of girls from overseas who ended up on Epstein's private jets. \nBecause Epstein's predatory habits stretch back many years and involved dozens of young-looking girls, there \nmay well be more evidence to uncover. \nUnder the concept of double jeopardy, Epstein can no longer be prosecuted for any of the charges covered by \nhis non-prosecution agreement, in which he agreed to serve a short term of incarceration, fund the civil suits of \nnamed victims, and register as a sex offender. The victims who accepted cash settlements in these civil suits \nagreed not to testify against him or speak publicly about the case. However, new evidence developed by the \nDepartment of Justice on other offenses not covered by the agreement, including allegations by additional \nvictims who come forward, could lead to new charges. There is no statute of limitations in the federal sex-\ntrafficking law, which was also enacted by the state of Florida in 2002. Because his predatory habits stretch \nback many years and involved dozens of young-looking girls, there may well be more evidence to uncover. \n(Several young women who claim to be Epstein victims have recently contacted a Ft. Lauderdale lawyer, but to \ndate no new civil complaints have been filed.) \n• Conchita Sarnoff: The Billionaire Pedphile's Sex Den \n• Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free \nThese new developments come one week after the publication of two articles in The Daily Beast about \nEpstein's pattern of sexual contact with underage girls, which Palm Beach police began investigating in 2005 \nand the U.S. Attorney's office then settled in a 2007 plea deal. The first article quoted a deposition by then-\nPalm Beach Chief of Police Michael Reiter, in which he stated that Epstein, a billionaire with many powerful \nfriends, had received special treatment in both his plea deal and the terms of his incarceration. Although federal \ninvestigators at one point produced a draft 53-page indictment against Epstein, he was eventually allowed to \nplead guilty to only two relatively minor state charges and receive a short term of incarceration: 13 months in \nthe county jail, during which he went to the office every day, and one year of community control, during which \nhe traveled frequently to New York and his private island in the Virgin Islands. \nThe Daily Beast has now discovered another instance in which Epstein apparently received special \nconsideration: As a convicted sex offender, he is required by law to undergo an impartial psychological \nevaluation prior to sentencing and to receive psychiatric treatment during and after incarceration. This is \nbecause child molesters tend to be repeat offenders with high rates of recidivism. According to a source in law \nenforcement, however, Epstein was allowed to submit a report by his private psychologist, Dr. Stephen \nAlexander of Palm Beach, Florida, whose phone has since been disconnected with no forwarding information. \nThe Daily Beast's second article provided details about Epstein's systematic abuse of underage girls at his \nPalm Beach mansion, where members of his staff allegedly recruited and paid a parade of teenagers, most of \nthem 16 or younger, to perform daily massages that devolved into masturbation, groping, and sometimes full-\nblown sexual contact. It also revealed a monetary relationship between Epstein and Jean Luc Brunel, a frequent \nvisitor to whom he gave $1 million around the same time that Brunel was starting his MC2 modeling agency. \nSome of the young girls MC2 recruited from overseas—often from Eastern Europe and South America—are \nknown to have been passengers on Epstein's private jets. \nThe U.S. Attorney General's Office in Florida says that it is against policy to confirm or deny the existence of \nan investigation. Jeffrey Epstein's lawyer, Jack Goldberger, says he has no knowledge of an ongoing probe, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029771 \nand he told The Daily Beast, \"Jeffrey Epstein has fully complied with all state and federal requirements that \narise from the prior proceedings in Palm Beach. There are no pending civil lawsuits. There are not and should \nnot be any pending criminal investigations, given Mr. Epstein's complete fulfillment of all the terms of his non-\nprosecution agreement with the federal government.\" \nConchita Sarnoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 500 companies and has \nproduced three current-events debate TV programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut to Kabul, and a segment \nfor The Oppenheimer Report.

Hundreds of thousands of Israelis were living with the reality of a warning\nsiren and a rapid dash into their shelters. For a while, amid negotiations through\nEgypt to end the rocket fire, we limited ourselves to sending small ground units\ninto Gaza to target the source of specific rocket attacks.

(Of\ncourse, if I were planning to get extensive emotional processing support from other\npeople, then I would seek their consent beforehand.)\n\nStill, it seems like the easiest way to get support would be to get it from my partner, who\nwould share more of the experience with me than anyone else.

Both of\nReagan elections were right in sync with Gallup’s poll survey at November of 1980 and November of 1984. Likewise, Bush\nSenior's election in November of 1988 was seen as Reagan’s third term and was foreseen by the Gallup poll question.\n\nAnd then both Clinton elections were right in line with the survey results from the Gallup poll questions in November of 1992\nand November of 1996.\n\nBush the younger’s election in 2000 is anomalous, but his reelection in 2004 is consistent with the measure as was McCain’s\n(really it was Bush’s) defeat in November 2008. The 2012 election also appears contrary to the survey response to the poll\nquestion. If this poll reestablishes its predictive power in 2016, Trump wins in a Reagan-like landslide.\n\nIV. Primary Colors\nWhile perhaps subtle, what happens in contested presidential primaries is also a harbinger of general elections. And if the\n\ncurrent Democratic and Republican primaries are accurate measures of voter enthusiasm, the Democrats are facing a tough\nup-hill fight against Republicans to say the least.\n\nUsing only states with party primaries, i.e. not state caucuses, and only party primaries up to the time when Donald Trump\nbecame the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, which was following the May 3'¢ Indiana primary, there has been\na large increase in voter turnout for the Republicans in 2016 when compared to either 2008 or 2012.

BROWN\nMiami Herald\n\nMIAMI — On a muggy October morning in\n2007, Miami's top federal prosecutor, Alexan-\nder Acosta, had a breakfast appointment with a\nformer colleague, Washington, D.C., attorney Jay\nLetkowitz,\n\nIt was an unusual mecting for the then-38-\nyear-old prosecutor, a rising Republican star who\nhad served in several White House posts before\nbeing named U.S, attomey in Miami by President\nGeorge W. Bush.\n\nInstead of meeting at the prosecutor's Miami\nheadquarters, the two men — both with profes-\nsional roots in the prestigious Washington law\nfinn of Kirkland & Ellis — convened at the\nMarriott in West Palm Beach, about 70 miles\naway. For Lefkowitz, 44, a U.S, special envoy to\nNorth Korea and corporate lawyer, the meeting\nwas critical.\n\nHis client, Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey\nEpstein, 54, was accused of assembling a large,\ncultlike network of underage girls — with the\nhelp of young female recnuiters —to coerce into\nhaving sex acts behind the walls of his opulent\nwaterfront mansion as often as three times a day,\nthe Town of Palm Beach police found.\n\nThe cecentric hedge fund manager, whose\nfriends included former President Bill Clinton,\nDonald Trump and Prince Andrew, was also\nsuspected of trafficking minor girls, often from\noverseas, for sex parties at his other homes in\nManhattan, New Mexico and the Virgin Islands,\nFBI and court records show.\n\nFacing a 53-page federal indictment, Epstein\ncould have ended up in federal prison for the rest\nof his life,\n\nBut on the morning of the breakfast meet-\ning, a deal was struck — an extraordinary plea\nagreement that would conceal the full extent\nof Epstein’ crimes and the number of people\ninvolved.\n\nNot only would Epstein serve just 13 months\nin the county jail, but the deal — called a non-\nprosecution agreement — essentially shut down\nan ongoing FBI probe into whether there were\nmore victims and other powerful people who\ntook part in Epstein's sex crimes, according to\na Miami Herald examination of thousands of\nemails, court documents and FBI records.\n\nThe pact required Epstein to plead guilty to\ntwo prostitution charges in state court.\n\nEpstein and four of his accomplices named in\nthe agreement received immunity from all federal\ncriminal charges. But even more unusual, the\ndeal included wording that granted immunity to\n“any potential co-conspirators” who were also\ninvolved in Epstein’s crimes,\n\nThese accomplices or participants were not\nidentified inthe agreement, leaving it open to\ninterpretation whether it possibly referred to other\ninfluential people who were having sex with\nunderage girls at Epstein’s various homes or on\nhis plane.\n\nAs partof the arrangement, Acosta agreed,\ndespite a federal law to the contrary, that the deal\nwould be kept from the victims, As a result, the\nnon-prosecution agreement was sealed until after\nit was approved by the judge, thereby averting\n\nFile photo by ABACA PRESS\n\nU.S. Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta, when he was a federal prosecutor in Miami, helped\n\nnegotiate an agreement that greatly reduced the severity of the conviction of Jeffrey Epstein, a\n\nsexual abuser of girls.\n\nany chance that the girls — or anyone else —\nmight show up in court and try to derail it.\nThis is the story of how Epstein, bolstered by\n\nunlimited funds and represented by a powerhouse\n\nlegal team, was able to manipulate the criminal\njustice system, and how his accusers, still trau-\n\nmatized by their pasts, believe they were betrayed\n\nby the very prosecutors who pledged to protect\nthem.\n\n“1 don’t think anyone has been told the truth\nabout what Jeffrey Epstein did,” said one of\nEpstein’s victims, Michelle Licata, now 30. “He\nruined my life and a lot of girls’ lives. People\nneed to know what he did and why he wasn't\nprosecuted so it never happens again.”\n\nNow President Donald Trump's secretary of\nlabor, Acosta, 49, oversees a massive federal\nagency that provides oversight of the country’s\nlabor laws, including human trafficking.\n\nAcosta didnot respond to numerous requests\n\n66\n\nJeffrey preyed on girls who were in\na bad way, girls who were basically\nhomeless. He went after girls who\nhe thought no one would listen to\nand he was right.\n\n— Courtney Wild,\nwho was 14 when she met Epstein\n\nfor an interview or answer queries through email.\nBut court records reveal details of the nego-\ntations and the role that Acosta would play in\narranging the deal, which scuttled the federal\nprobe into a possible international sex trafficking\noperation. Among other things, Acosta allowed\nEpstein’s lawyers unusual freedoms in dictating\nthe terms of the non-prosecution agreement.\n“The damage that\nhappened in this case is un-\nconscionable,” said Bradley\nEdwards, a former state\nprosecutor who represents\nsome of Epstein’s victims,\n“How in the world, do you,\nthe U.S. attorney, engage in\nanegotiation with a cnminal\ndefendant, basically allowing\nthat criminal defendant to\nwrite up the agreement?”\n\nBradley\nEdwards\n\nAsa result, neither the victims — nor even the\njudge — would know how many girls Epstein\nallegedly sexually abused between 2001 and\n2005, when his underage sex activities were first\nuncovered by police. Police referred the case to\nthe FBI a year later, when they began to suspect\nthat their investigation was being undermined by\nthe Palm Beach State Attomey’s Office.\n\nNot ‘he said, she said’\n\n“This was not a *he said,\nshe said’ situation. This was\n$0-something ‘shes’ and\none ‘he’ — and the ‘shes’\nall basically told the same\nstory,” said retired Palm\nBeach Police Chief Michael\nReiter, who supervised the\npolice probe.\n\nMore than a decade later,\nat atime when Olympic\ngymnasts and Hollywood\nactresses have become a catalyst fora cultural\nreckoning about sexual abuse, Epstein’s victims\nhave all but been forgotten,\n\nThe women — now in their late 20s and early\n30s — are still fighting for an elusive justice that\neven the passage of time has not made right.\n\nLike other victims of sexual abuse, they be-\nlieve they've been silenced by a cnminal justice\nsystem that stubbomly fails to hold Epstein and\nother wealthy and powerful men accountable.\n\n“Jefirey preyed on girls who were in a bad\nway, girls who were basically homeless. He went\nafter girls who he thought no one would listen to\nand he was right,” said Courtney Wild, who was\n14 when she met Epstein.\n\nOver the past year, the Miami Herald ex-\namined a decade's worth of court documents,\nlawsuits, witness depositions and newly released\nFBI documents. Key people involved in the\ninvestigation — most of whom have never\nspoken before — were also interviewed. The\nHerald also obtained new records, including the\nfull unredacted copy of the Palm Beach police\ninvestigation and witness statements that had\nbeen kept under seal,\n\nThe Herald leamed that, as part of the plea\ndeal, Epstein provided what the government\ncalled “valuable consideration” for unspecified\ninformation he supplied to federal investigators,\nWhile the documents obtained by the Herald\ndon't detail what the information was, Epstein’s\nsex. crime case happened just as the country’s\nsubprime mortgage market collapsed, ushering in\nthe 2008 global financial crisis.\n\nRecords show that Epstein was a key fed-\neral witness in the criminal prosecution of two\nprominent executives with Bear Stearns, the\nglobal investment brokerage that failed in 2008,\nwho were accused of corporate secunties fraud.\nEpstein was one of the langest investors in the\nhedge fund managed by the executives, who were\nlater acquitted. It is not known what role, if any,\nthe case played in Epstem’s plea negotiations.\n\nThe Herald also identified about 80 women\nwho say they were molested or otherwise sexu-\nally abused by Epstein from 2001 to 2006.

There were a lot of dead terrorists. There were also a lot of new ones.\n\nAs the war against terrorism had progressed in the years since 2001, it had\nproduced at least this: a huge amount of data. Inside the Pentagon, analysis teams\npoured over records of phone calls and text messages. They examined maps of\npersonal relations, and studied granular statistics about who had been killed and\nwhy and when. All of this information went into targeting computers and databases,\nand what became more and more apparent with each passing year was that the\nspread of terrorism after 9/11 looked like nothing so much as the spread of a\ndisease. This was, at first, no great insight. After all, revolutionary ideas, dangerous\nideologies or just plain panic often look like epidemics. But what was shocking as\nyou studied the Pentagon numbers was the speed of this infection. Disease\nepidemics, even the most virulently aggressive ones like Ebola or drug-resistant\ntuberculosis, move at the pace of human contact; they can be watched and blocked\nand even quarantined. But the contagions associated with terrorism were warp-\ndriven to a pace well beyond what the soldiers and analysts could match or even\nfully monitor. “Is our current situation such that ‘the harder we work, the behinder\nwe get?” Rumsfeld asked in 2003.38\n\nTo be constantly behind. This was a commander’s nightmare. Among other things it\nwas that sense of never quite catching up that had so seared the new generals in the\naudience of my speeches. But it seemed to be an inescapable reality. One day a guy\nin Baghdad would figure out how to make an Explosively Formed Penetrator (EFP) -\na sort of pipe bomb that becomes a flying chunk of red-hot steel and can smash\nthrough a tank from 100 yards away - and ten days later the same design of\nprojectile would take out an official thousands of miles away in rural Afghanistan,\nbefore US troops had had a chance to update their defenses.*? Behinder. An\nAmerican commander would arrive in a new town in Iraq, receive a briefing about\nwho he could really trust, and discover a week later half of them were showing up\non terrorist call logs. Behinder.\n\nThe Americans knew why this was happening. The data made that clear enough. The\nproliferation of roadside IEDs, for instance: Obviously there was Al-Qaeda Institute\nof Technology, no central IED academy where bomb makers could gather to safely\nstudy trigger design or leisurely swap placement ideas.*° Such a place would have\nbeen flattened by a Tomahawk or a drone within hours of its discovery. And though\ntomes like Tarek Mahmoud el-Sawah’s famous 400-page guide to bomb making\nwere often picked up on raids, they were out of date.

The diplomatic process with the Palestinians was stalemated. I\ncould see no point in remaining in the government.\n\nLike my last period in Olmert’s government, my final few months were\ndominated by finding a way to end Hamas attacks from Gaza. During one 24-hour\nperiod in November, Hamas launched more than 100 rockets at towns in the south,\nwhile also attacking two military units across the border. Especially since our\nmilitary response would be the last during my time as Defense Minister, I was\ndetermined that, this time, it would have a strictly defined objective and a finite\ntime frame. The overall objective hadn’t changed since Olmert’s premiership: to\nhit Hamas hard, bring down the number of rocket attacks to as near zero as\npossible, and reach an agreement, through the Egyptians, which established a\nperiod of calm on our border for as long as we could. Bibi’s “victimhood”\nnarrative notwithstanding, one aspect of the military balance in the south was now\ndramatically different. With my backing as Defense Minister, we now had Iron\nDome, which I was confident would help deal with the inevitable shower of Hamas\nrockets that would follow our initial attack. Again, I felt it was essential to start\nwith a quick, unexpected, damaging first strike. Then, through sustained air\nbombardment, to keep up enough pressure to secure the political arrangement we\nwanted. And, unlike under Olmert, to end the operation as soon as we’d achieved\nits aim.\n\nOn the afternoon of November 14, we launched a targeted air strike on Hamas’s\nde facto chief of staff, Ahmed Jabari. We’d gone after Jabari in the past but, for\none reason or another, had failed. We also hit nearly two dozen other Hamas\ntargets, including all of the main missile sites we had identified. The whole\noperation lasted a week. Hamas fired nearly 1,500 rockets into Israel, not just\nlocally manufactured Qassems but longer-range Iranian Fajr-5s and Russian Grads.\nFor the first time since the 1991 Gulf war, several were targeted at Tel Aviv and\nJerusalem. Fortunately, they were not significantly more accurate than in the past.\nMore than half landed in fields or orchards. And with Iron Dome deployed around\nour major towns and cities, more than 80 per cent were intercepted.\n\nWe hit nearly 1,500 targets over the seven-day period, mostly launch-pads,\nHamas government installations and weapons stores, but also a number of\napartment complexes being used by Hamas as bases or firing points. Bibi rightly\npointed out that we were forced to fight a fundamentally asymmetric battle.

At the same time, it sets certain\ncharacteristics of such a Universe and I believe we can test these...\n\nA computable Universe must already know the solution to every\nproblem it will encounter above the logic limit: It cannot discover\nknowledge on the fly. For many problems, a small number of fundamental\nrules can account for everything. Although our galaxy and the beautiful\nnebulae we see through our telescopes look complex, they might be\nthe result of some such simple set of rules — just like a fractal. That’s\nStephen Wolfram’s solution to the mystery of our Universe. But some\nproblems are complex. The solution to Fermat’s Last Theorem is an 80\npage document consisting of 5 million bits of information. All this must\nbe stored somewhere in the Universe. It might not be stored as a string\nof bytes, it could be found in a set of equations governing the motion of\nthe atoms such that at some point — in 1995 to be exact — they all line\nup in Andrew Wiles’ brain to direct his fingers to type out the proof.

The Universe is a big place\nand could store sufficient information to solve the mysteries that puzzle\nthe inquisitive creatures that inhabit its planes. There are many practical\nproblems to consider, such as how to preserve the information through\nall the strange evolutions of our Universe; inflation, star formation, and\nso on. But it could be done.\n\nThe second question is insurmountable and presents the counter\nargument to the determinists. Our Universe appears to be composed of\nnon-deterministic objects.

Indeed, he told\nme that he had a lot of difficulty knowing what was going on in his head. He did things\nlike laugh when a friend hurt his feelings, then deny that he was hurt, even though I could\nplainly see the stricken look behind his eyes.\n\nI wasn't surprised that he was more physical than verbal about S&M. Very\nstraightforward: throwing me around, pulling my head back, digging his hands into my\nskin.

Which row has more circles- A or B? A: O O OO O, B: OOOOO\n\n2. If Mike is taller than Jim, and Jim is shorter than Dan, then who is the shortest? Who is\n\nthe tallest?\n\nWhich is heavier- a pound of feathers or a pound of rocks?\n\n4.

Sally\nreturns, unaware of what happened. Where will Sally would look for her marble?\n\n7.

Among other things,\nthe episode shattered the old political establishment,\nwhich had been more or less equally divided between\nparties that were friendly to Russia and parties that\nfavored independence from the Kremlin and an\norientation toward Europe. For the foreseeable future,\npro-Russian parties were unlikely to play a major role\nin Ukrainian political life.\n\nRussia responded by seizing and illegally annexing\nCrimea and fomenting a frozen conflict in eastern\nUkraine. But the Kremlin also stepped up its campaign\nto demonize color revolutions more broadly as Amer-\nicas favored instrument of regime change, though no\nserious evidence of U.S. involvement in the Maidan\nrevolution was put forward. The color revolution threat\nbecame a major theme of Russian domestic propa-\nganda and political discourse. It even became a focus\nof the country's military planning.\n\nWhen speaking of color revolutions, Russian officials\nand commentators have struck several common\nthemes:\n\n1. Color revolutions are a U.S. strategy to break\nRussia's influence over its neighbors.' Nikolay\nPatrushev, secretary of Russia's Security Council\nand a longtime director of the Federal Security\nService (FSB), has described color revolutions\nas an American scheme to bring down gov-\nernments through the financing of opposition\ngroups and economic sanctions “under the pre-\ntext of human rights protection and the neces-\nsity to form civil society institutions.”? Russian\nofficials in 2015 warned that Electric Yerevan, an\nArmenian protest movement against electricity\nprice hikes, could be a provocation by the West\ndedicated to toppling a Moscow-friendly admin-\nistration?\n\n2. The threat of military action is an integral part of\nthe strategy. While color revolutions by definition\nemploy nonviolent tactics, Russian strategists\nclaim that the military dimension can be indirect,\nembedded in democratic governments’ warnings\nnot to use force against protesters. In other words,\naccording to the Kremlin, the United States and\nits allies stoke uprisings and then threaten to in-\ntervene if the authorities defend themselves. Rus-\nsias own response to the Maidan revolution was a\nreflection of this distorted image: It orchestrated\n\nseparatist revolts in parts of Ukraine and then\nused its military to defend them.*\n\n3. Color revolutions pose a danger to Russias allies\naround the world. To communicate its concerns\non this front, the Kremlin has invited military\ndelegations from China, Iran, Egypt, and other\nauthoritarian regimes for meetings at which\ncountering color revolutions is an important\ntheme.® Russian propaganda encourages gov-\nernments to do what is necessary to put down\ncivil society challenges, and praises incumbents\nwho succeed.\n\n4. Russia itself is under threat. “The aim is obvi-\nous,” Putin said of protests and social media ac-\ntivity in 2015, “to provoke civil conflict and strike\na blow at our country's constitutional founda-\ntions, and ultimately even at our sovereignty.”®\n\n5. Incumbents are ‘legitimate’ rulers. Russian offi-\ncials have stressed the legal and constitutional\nlegitimacy of authoritarian leaders facing major\nprotests, regardless of their crimes and blatant\nabuses of human rights and democratic norms.\nMoscow insisted that Yanukovych remained the\n“legitimate” president even after he had aban-\ndoned his post to escape punishment for his\nrole in the crackdown on demonstrators.\n\n6. Russia reserves the right to intervene in defense\nof ethnic Russians. By asserting this right, the\nKremlin is effectively saying that any color rev-\nolutions in neighboring states—many of which\nhave Russian-speaking minorities—could trigger\na Russian invasion, as in Ukraine. It could also\nbecome a self-fulfilling prophecy, whereby the\ngovernments of neighboring countries come\nto mistrust and mistreat their ethnic Russian\ncitizens, providing the Kremlin with an excuse to\nget involved.’\n\nThe Russian leadership's reaction to the color revolu-\ntions, with its paranoid obsession with sinister outside\nforces, is a clear indication of the lack of self-confidence\nthat is shared by all authoritarian powers. Whether the\nstate is led by a strongman, a politburo, or a supreme\nreligious leader, the world’s most repressive regimes\nunderstand that their systems offer few regular outlets\nfor public frustration with government performance.\n\nFear of color revolutions has intensified since the 2014\nevents in Ukraine, with a particular focus on the alleged\n\n24\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019258\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

L. Rev. 844, *867\n\nonce common and significant in many state justice systems. U.S. colonies and states created public prosecution offices much\nearlier than England. 77\n\n[*868] Even so, in the nation's earliest decades, those officials were often part-time or short-term officials, whose duties were\noften primarily quasi-judicial or administrative. 7* For those reasons, in many states those officials coexisted alongside private\nprosecutors with whom they shared some similarities. Early public prosecutors were paid by the case or the conviction ” and\npursued cases from private complainants. °° But by the mid-nineteenth century, every state had public prosecutor offices of\nsome sort. ®! Increasingly, they were full-time and accompanied by [*869] public police forces. In this context, private\nprosecutions diminished, then vanished. °?\n\nHowever, because public prosecutors continued to suffer from poor funding (and consequently were held in low regard), *\n\nsome states continued an alternate form of private prosecution: privately funded attorneys could assist in criminal prosecutions\nas long as the public prosecutor supervised or retained formal control. *4 This form of ancillary or supplementary private\nprosecution, which leaves charging decisions in public hands, is still permitted in several states. 8° Otherwise, only vestiges of\nprivate [*870] prosecution remain in a few states. Pennsylvania seems to have the strongest version: it permits private\nprosecutions for any offense upon the approval from a state prosecutor or a judge. *° Rhode Island authorizes private\nprosecutions only for misdemeanors. 8’ Under state common law, New Hampshire might permit the same for nonjailable\noffenses. °° Beyond that, judges in many states can issue an arrest warrant or criminal summons based on a private person's\ntestimony, but public prosecutors control whether to go forward with the case. °°\n\n[*871] In sum, U.S. jurisdictions are unusual among common law jurisdictions in having abolished private prosecution as a\nmeans to vindicate victims' private interests, a supplement to public enforcement resources, and a structural check on selective\nunderenforcement from biases in public prosecutors’ discretionary decisions not to charge. English authorities, in contrast,\nexplicitly recognize this public function for private prosecution. Private actors’ authority to second-guess declination decisions -\ncharging decision redundancy - operates as \"the ultimate safeguard for the citizen against inaction on the part of the\nauthorities.\" °° The only remnant of this view in the United States seems to be in Pennsylvania.

Shame regulates social behavior and serves as a forewarning of punishment:\nConform or suffer the consequences. The earliest feelings of shame were likely over issues of\nwaste management, greediness, and incompetence. While guilt is evoked by an individual’s\nstandards, shame is the result of group standards. Therefore, shame, unlike guilt, is felt only in\nthe context of other people.\n\nThe first hominids could keep track of cooperation and defection only by firsthand\nobservation. Many animals use visual observations to decide whether to work with others. Reef\nfish in the Red Sea, for instance, watch wrasses clean other reef fish, to determine whether or not\nthey’re cooperative, as biologist Redouan Bshary discovered. Bshary went scuba diving off\nEgypt’s coast to observe this symbiotic relationship. Bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides\ndimidiatus) eat parasites, along with dead or infected tissue, off reef fishes in more than 2,000\ninteractions a day, each of which can be considered an act of cooperation. Wrasses are tempted\nto eat more than just the parasites, but if the reef fish loses too much flesh in the deal, it will\nrefuse to continue working with the wrasse. Reef fish approach wrasses that they see cooperating\nwith their current clients and avoid the wrasses they see biting off more than they should chew.’\n\nLike the Bluestreak cleaner wrasses, humans are also more cooperative when they sense\nthey are being watched. Researchers at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne examined the\neffect of a pair of eyes on payments for tea and coffee to an honesty box.

Class Requirements \nThe purpose of this class is to give students a sense of the historical battles of the Internet, what \ndifferent actors were thinking, what they were trying to accomplish, and what levers they pulled \nin order to select for specific outcomes. Students should apply what they have learned from \nhistorical examples to a current Internet issue discussed in class and describe in a 12-15 page \npaper what a viable solution might look like. Solutions could take the form of a policy \nrecommendation, project proposal, or code. The paper or project proposal will be due on \nFriday, January 20th, and may be submitted by email to Samantha Bates at \nsbates@law.harvard.edu. \nIV.

We aspire to the implausible: a nine-day introduction to the unusual dynamics of the \nworld's digital space, sufficient for a strategic understanding of what makes it difficult (but far \nfrom impossible) to regulate or shape; who's trying to do it nonetheless; and how such efforts \nhave fared over the past twenty years, with an eye towards lessons for influencing the space \nand the behavior within it today. \nIn addition to offering some frameworks for thinking about Internet architecture and policy, and \nthe curious open and generative nature of the phenomenon, we will delve into the net as a \ncontingently global phenomenon, and the way that complicates regulation by traditional \nsovereigns. Our case study will be the current debates around implementation of Europe's \"right \nto be forgotten\" in search engine results. As you complete the readings, you might see how \nyou'd answer the question of what a state like France's view should be towards the scope of its \nRTBF regulation, and whether the kind of \"zoning\" described in the Cato Institute article from \nthirteen years ago (!), is realizable and desirable. \nReadings: \n• C.P.

Academic \ntechnologies brought into the mainstream made it trivial to prepare and distribute perfect copies \nof copyrighted work without permission -- and the comparatively powerful organizations \nrepresenting copyright holders saw this as an existential threat. \nWe will read some of the \"grim joy\" experienced by Internet freedom types in dancing on the \ngrave of copyright in the mid-1990s -- and immerse in some of the law and policy changes \neffected in the United States to deal with the problem without running up against the equities of \nrapidly-growing intermediaries of online and Internet service providers (turns out, there's a \ndifference). \nThe copyright wars revealed a variety of strategies that we'll look at with the benefit of years of \nhindsight, including lawsuits against network providers, software makers, and individual users \nboth sending and receiving files, as well as technical changes designed to make it more difficult \nto share items that wish not to be shared. Ultimately we are drawn to the question of whether \nthe wars were won by one side or another, or whether it's more accurate to say that they simply \nfaded away. What issues today feel make-or-break, yet could simply fade rather than be \nresolved, and why? \nWe'll end the day with a peek into, and practice of, a current intense if obscure debate: that of \nwhether digital rights management hooks should be placed into standards for Web browsers. \nReadings: \n• John Perry Barlow, \"The Economy of Ideas,\" Wired (March 1994) \nhttp://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/2.03/economy.ideas.html?topic=&topic set=  \narchived at https://perma.cc/P82S-RZP3. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024260 \n• Matthew Green, Napster Opens Pandora's Box: Examining How File-Sharing Services \nThreaten the Enforcement of Copyright on the Internet, 63 Oh.

How successful is such surveillance, and \nwill it continue to be effective as the public reacts by potentially adopting privacy-enhancing \ntools? How successful do we want it to be, and how might frameworks agreeable within \njurisdictions that embrace the rule of law be used or abused within those that do not? \nReadings: \n• David O'Brien, Matt Olsen, Bruce Schneier, and Jonathan Zittrain, et al. \"Don't Panic. \nMaking Progress on the 'Going Dark' Debate,\" The Berkman Center for Internet & \nSociety at Harvard University (Feb 1, 2016) \nhttps://cyber.law.harvard.edu/pubrelease/dont-panic/Dont Panic Making Progress on  \nGoing Dark Debate.pdf archived at https://perma.cc/NT9M-ELAG. \n• John Cassidy, \"Lessons from Apple vs. The F.B.I.,\" The New Yorker (March 29, 2016) \nhttp://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/lessons-from-apple-versus-the-f-b-i  \narchived at https://perma.cc/282P-A7MS. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024263 \n• Susan Landau, Testimony for House Judiciary Committee Hearing on \"The Encryption \nTightrope: Balancing Americans' Security and Privacy\" (March 1, 2016) \nhttps://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Landau-Written-Testimony.pdf \narchived at https://perma.cc/N9D9-JTYQ. \n• Bruce Schneier, \"Data Is a Toxic Asset, So Why Not Throw It Out?,\" Schneier on \nSecurity (March 1, 2016) \nhttps://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2016/03/data is a toxic asse.html archived \nat https://perma.cc/7NUL-W5YJ. \n• Stewart Baker, \"Why the NSA Needs Your Phone Calls...and why you (probably) \nshouldn't worry about it,\" Foreign Policy (June 6, 2013) \nhttp://foreignpolicy.com/2013/06/06/why-the-nsa-needs-your-phone-calls/ archived at \nhttps://perma.cc/YE3N-TSWU. \n• [OPTIONAL] Harold Abelson et al., \"Keys Under Doormats: Mandating insecurity by \nrequiring government access to all data and communications,\" CSAIL (Jul 7, 2015). \nhttps://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-keys-under-doormats-CSAIL.pdf \narchived at https://perma.cc/2L3U-QST8. \nDay 5: Internet Architecture/Net Neutrality \nWe increasingly assume the availability of commodity networking -- a flat fee for access -- even \nas the way in which we experience the Internet is evolving through a curious microeconomics, a \nmishmash of policies designed to subsidize or regulate access, and a sometime ability to \narbitrage around arrangements through technologies to facilitate access sharing and virtual \ntunneling. \nHow is Internet access likely to evolve, and what choices exist for polities with particular ideals \nabout how it should work? \nDiscussion will include Andy Ellis, Berkman Klein Center Fellow and CSO of Akamai, one of the \nmost important companies that people haven't heard of. \nReadings: \nNet Neutrality \n• [FOR REFERENCE] Net Neutrality timeline, Public Knowledge: \nhttp://whatisnetneutrality.org/timeline archived at https://perma.cc/L8JE-QYP8. \n• Tim Wu, Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination.

The famously libertarian Electronic Frontier Foundation recently released a white \npaper in which it acknowledged a line between a clash of ideas and flat-out harassment, with \nthe latter causing less rather than more robust debate. Separately, concerns about outright \nfalse news that spreads virally have inspired calls for action by intermediaries like Facebook -- a \nself-described technology, rather than media, company. \nApplying lessons from the conflicts of the past two decades online, how might we agree upon a \nvision for social networking even if we disagree on many substantive issues to be debated \nthere, and what are the roles, if any, of regulators and private platforms in establishing \nboundaries on behavior online through code or legal sanction? \nIs it more difficult to agree on a vision is our media is no longer about the battlefield or the real \nworld but is the battlefield and the real world? \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024265 \nReadings: \nThe Problem \n• Eugene Volokh, \"No, there's no 'hate speech' exception to the First Amendment,\" The \nWashington Post (May 7, 2015) \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/07/no-theres-no-h  \nate-speech-exception-to-the-first-amendment/?utm term =.78330882267d  archived at \nhttps://perma.cc/A5ES-HMQE. \n• Jon Ronson, \"How One Stupid Tweet Blew Up Justine Sacco's Life,\" The New York \nTimes Magazine (February 12, 2015) \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-sacc  \nos-life.html? r=0 archived at https://perma.cc/3AHS-Z9EU. \n• Adrian Chen, \"The Agency,\" The New York Times Magazine (June 2, 2015) \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html? r=0 archived at \nhttps://perma.cc/BER2-TD6E. \n• Reeves Wiedeman, \"The Sandy Hook Hoax,\" The New York Magazine (September 5, \n2016) http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/09/the-sandy-hook-hoax.html archived \nat https://perma.cc/T9YD-U8Z9. \n• Gilad Lotan, \"Fake News Is Not the Only Problem,\" Points (November 22, 2016) \nhttps://points.datasociety.net/fake-news-is-not-the-problem-f0Oec8cdfcb#.kwtO1pk4h  \narchived at https://perma.cc/B3FK-FJVX. \n• Craig Silverman, \"How Teens In The Balkans Are Duping Trump Supporters With Fake \nNews,\" BuzzFeed (November 3, 2016) \nhttps://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/how-macedonia-became-a-global-hub-for-pro-\ntrump-misinfo?utm term=.n1pEm5kbY#.apomjgWID archived at \nhttps://perma.cc/SB2G-9XUM. \n• Caitlin Dewey, \"Facebook fake-news writer: 'I think Donald Trump is in the White House \nbecause of me,- The Washington Post (November 17, 2016) \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/17/facebook-fake-news  \n-writer-i-think-donald-trump-is-in-the-white-house-because-of-me/?utm term=.e2d9c7b0  \nd5e6 archived at https://perma.cc/B6S4-UBJC. \nThe Search for Solutions \n• Andy Greenberg, \"Inside Google's Internet Justice League and Its AI-Powered War on \nTrolls,\" Wired (September 19, 2016) \nhttps://www.wired.com/2016/09/inside-googles-internet-justice-league-ai-powered-war-tr \nolls/ archived at https://perma.cc/K56R-MGBX. \n• Dia Kayyali and Danny O'Brien, \"Facing the Challenge of Online Harassment\" Electronic \nFrontier Foundation (January 8, 2015) \nhttps://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/01/facing-challenge-online-harassment, archived at \nhttps://perma.cc/98RS-L876. \n• State v.

To what extent should new technologies be \nshaped and shared by anyone without gatekeeping? 2017 may find the Internet in middle age. \nDo its puzzles suggest anything about whether and how to resolve governance questions for \nmore newly mainstreamed technologies like machine learning and other Al? \nIn addition to the challenges that the Internet has provided in regulation and governance, the \ninability to really understand what many \"learned\" algorithms do, and their ability to have \nproperties and abilities beyond the capabilities of their initial designers, presents additional \nchallenges when thinking about whether and how to regulate the research, as well as the \ndeployment, of Al. Phenomena like digital currencies and distributed Al systems reprises the \nideas and challenges of Barlow's declaration of independence of cyberspace. \nReadings: \nGovernance: loT Security \n• J.M.

This suggests people will fall out of love when there is a\npermanent change in alternative mating opportunities or relationship costs, but not a\none-off temptation. For example, a man may fall out of love with his wife after becoming\nunexpectedly successful, as many more women will be now be interested in him than\nhe anticipated when they first met. Second, the model clarifies that love comes with a\ncost-the cost of ignored temptations—and suggests that this cost must be compensated\nwith commensurate investment in the relationship. Only sometimes is it worthwhile for\nthe recipient of love to compensate a suitor, which explains why people actively avoid the\nstrong affections of those with whom they do not wish to have long-term relationships.\nThird, our model clarifies why mere discussions of the costs and benefits of a relationship\nor a break-up, for example, suggesting a prenuptial agreement, damage the relationship.\nSuch discussions indicate that one is looking at the costs of the relationship and cast\ndoubt on one’s commitment.\n\nThese arguments extend to anger. Anger can be thought of as “punishing without\nlooking”. It prevents people from looking at the costs of inflicting harm on others after a\n\ntransgression, thereby deterring future transgressions.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis research was funded in part by the John Templeton Foundation, Grant RFP-12-\n11 from the Foundational Questions in Evolutionary Biology Fund, the National Science\nFoundation Grant No. 0905645, and the Army Research Office Grant No. W911NF-11-\n1-0363.

They\nwere mainly interested in getting on with their lives. Yet there were signs of\ntrouble. The PLO leaders’ relocation to Tunis had reduced their direct influence.\nBut the briefings I got from Shin Bet officers made it clear that some young\nWest Bankers had begun trying to organize attacks against police, soldiers and\nIsraeli civilians. The settlements were also growing in number, and their\nresidents were not above acts of violence against Palestinians. Further\ncomplicating the situation was the fact the settlers enjoyed the support of key\nLikud members in the cabinet: Shamir, who was about to take his turn as Prime\nMinister in October 1986; Misha, now a minister without portfolio; and most of\nall Arik Sharon. In an astonishing demonstration of resilience and\ndetermination, not only had Arik remained as a minister without portfolio when\nShamir succeeded Menachem Begin. In the coalition government, he had\nbecome Minister of Trade and Labor. Most importantly, when he’d been\nAgriculture Minister under Begin, he was the driving force in plans to expand\nJewish settlement on the West Bank, including “blocs” placed around the major\nPalestinian towns and cities for the first time since 1967.\n\nI had a responsibility to protect the settlers, and I did my best to fulfil it. Yet\nI believed it was essential they understood that they were subject to the\nauthority of the state of Israel and, like other Israeli citizens, had to operate\nwithin the law. This was no mere theoretical problem. A Jewish underground\nhad been established by members of Gush Emunim, the Orthodox Jewish\nmovement set up in the 1970s to advance what they saw as a divinely mandated\nmission to settle the West Bank. It had carried out car-bombings and other\nattacks in the early 1980s, leaving two Palestinian mayors crippled for life. The\nterror campaign had ended only when the Shin Bet caught the cell placing\nexplosives under Arab-owned buses in Jerusalem.\n\nHopeful of preventing misunderstandings, and ideally building a relationship\nof trust, I visited many of the settlements during the early weeks in my new post\nand spoke with their leaders, a few of whom remain friends to this day. But in\nthe spring of 1986, we faced our first major test on the ground. In a pre-\nPassover event organized by Gush Emunim, some 10,000 settlers streamed into\nHebron, a city sacred not only to Jews but Muslims as well as the burial place of\nHebrew patriarchs and matriarchs. Peace Now activists had planned a counter-\nprotest, but Rabin denied them permission. Still, anti-settlement members of the\nKnesset and other Israeli peace activists did get clearance to march from\nJerusalem to Hebron.\n\n221\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011692\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

For many, illiberalism’s\ndefining feature is intolerance toward minority groups:\nthe LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender)\ncommunity, Roma, Muslims, refugees and migrants\n\nof all sorts. But in Hungary and elsewhere, illiberal\ngovernment signifies something much more compre-\nhensive than the prime minister asserting that “every\nsingle migrant poses a public security and terror risk,”\nand that refugees bring “gangs hunting down our\nwomen and daughters”*—two of Orban's more incen-\ndiary declarations.\n\nThe Hungarian leader is instead telling us that illiberal-\nism involves a wholesale rejection of liberal values and\ndemocratic norms, with all that this implies for politics\nand governance. Fidesz’'s “reform” efforts have been less\nconcerned with the repression of unpopular minori-\nties than with the creation of a system in which the\ninstitutions of pluralism are hollowed out and the ruling\nparty's dominance is assured over the long term.\n\naving come to office with a two-thirds parliamen-\ntary majority in 2010, Orban was able to rewrite the\nconstitution without the consent of the opposition.\n\ne rushed through a series of constitutional changes,\ncardinal laws (requiring a two-thirds vote to change or\nremove), and regular laws that had the effect of turn-\ning the Hungarian political system upside down.\n\nAmong the steps taken by Fidesz after its 2010 triumph:\n\n¢ The Constitutional Court was overhauled so that\nFidesz appointees became a majority and its\njurisdiction was narrowed.\n\n¢ The government eliminated the independent\nFiscal Council, responsible for overseeing bud-\ngetary policy, then replaced it with a new council\nunder Fidesz control.\n\n¢ Anewelection law created gerrymandered legis-\nlative districts that were favorable to Fidesz.®\n\n¢ Orban gave voting rights to ethnic Hungarians\nin neighboring countries, who were likely to\n\nsupport Fidesz.’\n\n¢ The government created a new press authority\n\nwhose chair and members were Fidesz loyalists.\nThe authority was given wide-ranging powers to\nfine media outlets.’\n\nWhile the measures listed above were some of the most\nnotorious of the Fidesz initiatives, in some cases draw-\ning critical attention from European oversight bodies,\nthey represent only part of the campaign that has trans-\nformed Hungary into a full-fledged illiberal democracy.\n\nPerhaps the more far-reaching measures introduced\nunder Orban have been in the economic sphere. Since\n2010, Hungary has evolved into a crony capitalist state\npar excellence. But unlike in outright kleptocracies\nsuch as Russia, where the regime itself is organized\naround the plunder of public wealth by the ruling\nclique, Orban has used state laws and procurement\ncontracts to create a wealthy Fidesz-affiliated business\nconstituency that can finance political campaigns, re-\nward party supporters, and operate friendly media out-\nlets. The enrichment of cronies is less an objective in\nitself than a means of fortifying the dominant political\nparty against any future challenge from the opposition.®\n\nWhile Orban is highly unpopular in European liberal\ncircles, he has gained a following among conserva-\ntives in both Europe and the United States. At a 2015\ncongressional subcommittee hearing in Washington,\none Republican legislator after another defended the\nFidesz government, often in ways that demonstrated\nblatant ignorance of political conditions in Budapest.'®\nConservatives praise Orban for his commitment to\ntraditional values and decisive leadership, but they\nignore the course he has set for the economy.\n\nSince taking power in 2010, the prime minister has\nviolated practically every principle of the free market\nand prudent economic stewardship. Were Hungary a\ndeveloping state in Latin America or Africa, donor gov-\nernments would likely have imposed special conditions\non foreign assistance given the overt acts of corruption\nand cronyism that Fidesz has embraced as a matter of\npublic policy. This includes a pattern of awarding gov-\nernment contracts to businesses with Fidesz ties, the\nadoption of special laws to benefit Fidesz supporters in\nthe business community, the use of punitive taxation\nagainst foreign-owned corporations, tax concessions\nfor corporations controlled by Fidesz loyalists, and the\ngranting of control over nationalized sectors of the\n\neconomy to Fidesz supporters.\n\nIn its relentless drive to hand economic power to its\nallies, Fidesz resembles the old-style political ma-\n\n36\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019270\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

We assigned a specific penetration\nrate to each age group, with the 21—29 age group having the highest and the 70+ age group having the\n\nlowest.\n\nConsumer penetration rates are significantly affected by the available channels for legal access to\ncannabis. States that have only medical laws typically have lower penetration rates than states hav-\ning both medical and recreational laws because the qualifying-condition requirement of medical laws\nprecludes many potential consumers. Similarly, penetration rates are impacted by the widely varying\nnumber and nature of qualifying medical conditions designated by medical laws. States that designate\nmany conditions or highly subjective conditions such as “chronic pain” tend to have higher penetration\nrates than states that designate relatively few or highly specific conditions.\n\nPenetration rates also are affected by the reach of a state’s cannabis dispensary network. Some states\nhave extensive dispensary networks that provide convenient access to cannabis for most consumers.\nOther states have a limited number of dispensaries or networks that reach only urban areas; restricted\nnetworks can be the result of factors such as the amount of time a state has permitted legal cannabis\naccess and the prevalence of county and municipal laws restricting (or in some cases, completely ban-\nning) dispensary operations.\n\nPrior to federal legalization, we expect U.S. penetration rates to increase as states implement new\nmedical and recreational laws and expand the scope of qualifying medical conditions under existing\nmedical laws, and as the FDA begins approving pharmaceutical-grade drugs derived from cannabis.\nAlthough we believe penetration rates in states with recreational laws and robust dispensary networks\nmay fairly represent penetration rates after federal legalization, penetration rates may increase further\nas the medical efficacy of cannabis becomes better understood and negative perceptions of cannabis\ndiminish. Following federal legalization, we believe penetration rates may ultimately be as high as (or\nhigher than) those in other consumer-driven industries, such as alcohol, tobacco and pharmaceuticals.\nThe consumer penetration rates used in our analysis are as follows.\n\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC 109\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024745\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But on\nthe weekend of my first visit, the Tai Hu center was closed to outsiders. Only about\nten of us were present. We were all, together, students. On our first morning we\nwalked to a large hall overlooking the lake and sat down quietly on benches and\nmeditated for three hours. And on our first evening, Master Nan sat with us during\ndinner, looking young and vital and 20 years short of his 92, barely eating. Above the\nbridge of his nose, I noticed, was a small marble-sized bump. This is the mark that\nemerges, according to Buddhist tradition, when your self-cultivation and meditation\nhas led you to deep breakthrough, when energy begins to slip out of your head at\nthat “third eye” spot and into the world, leaving a little bump as evidence.\n\nAs we finished dinner, Master Nan turned the conversation to me and asked me to\nspeak about what was on my mind. In later years I would learn this was his habit, to\nhand the floor over to his guests for a bit - whether they were politicians or\nindustrial titans or innocent visitors - before entering into his own reflections. He\npursued me with careful questions, his voice purring with a thick coastal accent. The\nquestions seemed removed sometimes from my main points, but I quickly came to\nsee them as needles. (“When he uttered a phrase,” it was said of Yun Men, “it was\nlike an iron spike.”) Many of those present were jotting notes: Whatever Master Nan\nthought important, his students felt, must be worth putting down.\n\nI knew that the records of Nan’s lectures and discussions were often circulated by\nemail. With subject lines like “Understanding This Chinese Generation” or “Master\nNan Answers Questions About Chinese and Western Knowledge,” they were real-\ntime maps of the usually invisible dance our daily lives do with history and\nphilosophy. We live now, of course, but Nan was always aware that we lived within\nan historical flow too, in a particular moment amidst constant change. Remember\nthat the foundational text of Chinese civilization is the 2500-year old Yi Jing, The\nBook of Changes. If Westerners are accustomed to consistent historical, Chinese\nbegin with the idea of a flux of forces as the only constant. A world of ceaseless\nchange means that valuable, useful education is less about facts than about the\ntraining of a vigilant instinct for reaction.” It was a version of this same aim that was\nat the heart of Nan’s teaching, and that made his ideas so magnetically appealing.\n\nThe circulation lists on his lecture notes were the Chinese equivalent of a roster that\nincluded Ben Bernanke, Colin Powell, and Warren Buffett. They reflected the\nbreadth of curiosity about his ideas, and the hunger to understand and digest\nchanges in China and the world. “I just had a very senior leader here,” Nan told me\nduring a visit several years later. | had seen the high security at the compound and\n\n2 A world of ceaslesee change: See Francois Jullien, The Silent Tranformations\n(London: Seagull Books, 2011) 70, and David Hall and Roger T.

H.L. Mencken used to bemoan the reality that:\n“The trouble about fighting for human freedom is that you have to spend much of your life\ndefending sons of bitches: for oppressive laws are always aimed at them originally, and\nopression must be stopped in the beginning if it is to be stopped at all.”\n\nIn each instance, I’ve stood up for an important principle: the right of the individual, rather than\nthe government, to decide what to say, what to show, what to hear, what to see, what to teach,\nwhat to learn. I have opposed the power of the state (and other state-like institutions) to censor,\npunish, chill, or impose costs on the exercise of the freedom of expression—even, perhaps\nespecially, expression with which I disagree and despise or believe may be hateful, hurtful or even\ndangerous.\n\nI have myself been the victim of outrageous defamations (including that I beat and killed my wife!\nAnd that I plagiarized my book “The Case for Israel’). I have been accused (falsely, I believe) of\ndefaming others. I have been informally charged with inciting war crimes, and formally charged\nwith criminally defaming a judge—to which I plead not guilty! I have defended the right of my\nenemies to lie about me, to boo and heckle me and even to try to get me fired. While defending\nthe right of my political, ideological and personal opponents to say nearly anything they want, I\nhave insisted on my own right to criticize, condemn and vilify them for the wrongness of what\nthey have chosen to say. Freedom of expression includes the right to be wrong, but it does not\ninclude the right to be immune from verbal counterattack.\n\nI am not a free speech absolutist when it comes to the First Amendment—at least not in theory.\nBut in practice I nearly always side with the freedom to speak, rather than the power to censor.\n\nIt’s not that I trust the citizenry; it’s that I distrust the government. It’s not that I believe the\nexercise of the freedom of speech will always bring about good results; it’s that I believe that the\nexercise of the power to censor will almost always bring about bad results. It’s not that I believe\nthe free marketplace of ideas will always produce truth; it’s that I believe that the shutting down\nof that marketplace by government will prevent the possibility of truth.\n\nMy family and educational background—especially my constant arguments with rabbis, teachers,\nneighbors and friends—made me into a skeptic about everything, even skepticism. I am certain\nthat certainty is the enemy of truth, freedom and progress. Hobbs has been proved wrong by the\nverdict of history in his inclusion among the “rights of sovereigns” the power to censor “all books\nbefore they are published” that are “averse” to “the truth,” or not conducive to peace.\n\nI know that I will never know “the truth.” But neither will anyone else. All I can do is doubt,\nchallenge, question and keep open the channels of knowledge, the flow of information and the\n\nright to change my mind. To me, truth is not a noun; it is an active verb, as in “truthing” (or\nknowing, learning or experiencing).\n\n85\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017172\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

But when the commission of\ninquiry released its report in April 2007, three people were singled out: Olmert,\nAmir Peretz and Halutz. Olmert was portrayed as a military novice who’d gone\ninto battle without understanding the wartime role and responsibilities of a Prime\nMinister. Halutz’s “excess of charisma” was held responsible for keeping\nministers, and military officers as well, from questioning his judgement or pressing\nhim for alternatives. Amir Peretz was found to be the wrong man in the wrong\ncabinet post at the wrong time. Of the three, only Halutz seemed ready to take\npersonal responsibility. Even before the report came out, he resigned. Olmert and\nPeretz were determined to stay put, despite calls to quit not just from the\nopposition but from Tzipi Livni. Inside Labor as well, the war produced a clamor\nfor change. When a vote for party chairman was held in June 2007, I was chosen to\nreturn in Peretz’s place.\n\nWithin days, I replaced him as Defense Minister as well.

That's more optimistic than the IMF's prediction from three months ago, but those\nare still lousy numbers. A weak economy throughout 2010 would mean a bleak employment picture, an agonizingly slow housing\nrecovery, and another year or two likely to feel like a recession, whether it's technically labeled that or not.\nWe should count ourselves lucky, though. The IMF expects at least 11 major parts of the world to have more severe economic\ncontractions than the United State this year, including most of western Europe, Japan, Russia, and Mexico.

Protocols embody shared rules. Their subtle, decisive\npower is to place each bit of data ina reliable, predictable order, just as diplomatic\nprotocol might seat ambassadors at a negotiation. “Protocol,” the theorists\nAlexander Galloway and Eugene Thacker have written, “is a system for maintaining\norganization and control in networks.”18\n\nIn a world of older, more traditional power distributions Americans might worry\nabout a day when another language, another “protocol” in a sense — Chinese or\nSpanish, say - would pry the central connective role away from English. Protocols\nare hard to change, of course. So many people have learned English; whole systems\ndepend on its use. To suddenly switch the world’s airline pilots, bond traders and\ncomputer programmers to Chinese or Spanish would hardly be worth the immense\ncost and the colliding confusion such a transfer would demand. But it’s here where\nthe Seventh Sense axiom, that connection changes the nature of an object, gives usa\nnew view. For the first time, as a result of connectivity, a once unimagined\npossibility exists: rapid, real-time machine translation. Fast, ubiquitous network\nlinks mean that the central role of English is boiled away by another language than\nby a connected, intelligent network skin. “Good morning,” is less likely to be\novertaken by a greeting from some other language as it is to be effortlessly, invisibly\ntransmuted into “5 _E 4?” or “Buenos Dias.” Fast access to a great translation\nalgorithm will be more important than the ability to speak English (or Spanish or\nChinese). Even as an advocate of learning other languages, it’s hard not to feel that\nthe American parents now plowing their children urgently into Chinese classes are\nmissing the point. Fluency in any second language in the future will be an arcane\nspecialty. Better to teach the kids how to build an Al, or to debate the moral\nreasoning of Confucius and Socrates than how to order dinner. The machines will\ntake care of that. Power in a connected age will pool, then, not in the mouths and\nminds of English speakers, but rather into the hands of anyone who controls the\nbest translation server.\n\nConnection has changed the nature of several objects here: The language itself, the\npeople who use it - pilots, commodity traders, machines, you and J. You can see how\nthe ability to design, build and turn on (or off) the fastest, smartest, most connected\nlanguage machines becomes a nexus of fresh power. What will replace English isn’t\nSpanish or Chinese, but a protocol. This sort of specialized data-pipe will permit\ninstant, always-improving translation. It will become as crucial to the operation of\nthe global economy or research laboratories or entertainment companies as English\nnow is. More crucial, in fact, because these machines will enable vast new\ncommunication links with a fidelity far better than pidgin-level speech. They will\nconsider not only what we say, but what they suspect we mean to say in the quest of\never clearer discussion. The pre-network instinct of Fear Chinese! Fear Spanish! is\nthe wrong one. As is the idea to teach the world Chinese or Spanish as a source of\npower. Rather, Can we control this turbo-smart connected language platform? is the\nright question. So many of the threats we worry about today have been similarly\n\n18 “Protocol”: Alexander Galloway and Eugene Thacker, “Protocol, Control, and\nNetworks” in Grey Room 17, Fall 2004, pp. 9\n\n20\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018255\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The visit to\nMerrick was a good place to get into some of my views about conspiracy and the human mind’s\nability to latch on to anything to avoid unpleasant facts. Squeaky’s line “Well what do you expect\nfrom me. I’m crazy” was obviously later then this meeting, but it was just too good a line to let go.\n\n| didn’t use elements of your essay that made actual filming and production tougher. For example,\nthe interlude in your essay where you went to a home of friend of the family and smoked weed\nfor example became “you\" smoking weed at their pad.\n\n| added in beats, character traits and dialgoue that helped form that \"dramatic arc\" that works in\nmovies so well.

When I recounted this story to my Harvard colleague of 50 years, he replied: “Alex was\nright. You don’t fit in here.” I never tried to.\n\nIn order to obtain tenure, each assistant professor had to publish a “tenure piece.” I wrote an\narticle on the relationship between law and psychiatry that was critical of the law’s overreliance\non psychiatry in judging whether mentally ill criminals could be held responsible for their crimes,\nand whether people thought to be dangerously mentally ill should be preventively detained in\nasylums. Because the article insisted that these decisions should be based on legal rather than\nmedical criteria, and because it was somewhat critical of certain views espoused by my mentor\nJudge Bazelon—who was regarded at the epitome of unsoundness by the Harvard Law School\nestablishment—it was deemed sound and I was voted tenure.\n\nWhile I was being considered for tenure, I began to get offers from the other elite law\nschools—Columbia, Chicago, Stanford, Yale, NYU. I was earning $12,000 a year at Harvard\nand would be offered a raise to $14,000 when I received tenure. Stanford offered me $20,000,\nwhich was the highest offer any assistant professor had ever received in the history of law\nteaching. It was well above what many full professors at Harvard were then making. I went to\nDean Griswold and told him I couldn’t afford to turn down an additional $6,000 since I had two\nkids in private school and no money in the bank. He told me sternly that he could not pay me\nmore than older professors so he raised everyone’s salary starting with mine to $21,000. I\nbecame the most popular professor among my young colleagues who all benefited from what\nbecame known as “the Dershowitz bump.”\n\nOver my long career at Harvard, I’ve published a great deal. I’ve never counted but one of my\nsecretaries estimated that she typed a million words a year for me (including legal briefs). This\nwould amount to 500 books! I love writing. I write every day, on hundreds of subjects, and I\nwrite everything by hand on yellow pads. I venture to guess that I’ve probably published more\nwords (not necessarily wiser or better, but more) than any professor in the law school’s\nhistory—imore than 30 books, hundreds of chapters in other books, dozens of law review articles\nand thousands of newspaper and magazine articles.\n\nI’ve probably also taught more different courses than most other professors. These include:\n\nCriminal Law; Constitutional Litigation; Family Law; Psychiatry and the Law; the Prediction and\nPrevention of Harmful Conduct; Race and Violence; the Scriptural Sources of Justice; the Law of\nSports; the Legal, Moral and Psychological Implications of Shakespeare’s Tragedies; Ethics and\nTactics in the Trial of Criminal Cases; Human Rights; Terrorism and the Law; Probabilities and\nthe Law; a Comparative Analysis of Talmud and Common Law; Wikileaks and the First\nAmendment; the Arab Israeli Conflict through Literature; Black Power and its Legal Implications;\nThe Writings of Thomas Jefferson; and Constraining Prosecutorial Misconduct.\n\nIn addition to my classes at the law school, I have also taught numerous classes at Harvard\n\nCollege, including a very large course that I created and taught jointly with Professor Robert\nNozick and Stephen J.

Frankly, I saw nothing wrong with earning money through honest endeavor,\nand using the proceeds to provide economic security for myself and my family,\nand to give our grandchildren a better start in life than Nava’s or my own parents\nhad been able to do.\n\nIn the end, we didn’t move to Kfar Shmaryahu. But that was because of an even\nmore profound change in my life: I separated from Nava, after more than 30 years\ntogether. When we had begun plans to move, I laughed off a warning from a\npsychologist friend of mine that decisions like building a new house could lead to a\ndeeper reassessment of your life. But that is at least in part what happened. There\nwere also other changes that caused me to stop and take stock. I was no longer\nPrime Minister. My father had passed away soon after I left office. Professionally,\nI was exploring new areas and developing new interests. Nava and I had been\nhappily married since our twenties. We had three wonderful daughters, and a first\ngrandchild. Yet the more I thought about where we were in our lives, the more I\nfelt our future paths were pulling us in different directions. For both of us, the\nseparation was difficult, though it was made a bit less painful because Nava knew\nthat it had nothing to do with another woman, or another relationship. I did\nimagine that I might one day meet someone else. But I was equally prepared for it\nnot happening. I certainly didn’t expect it any time soon.\n\nWhen it did, it began by accident. A few weeks after our separation, I was\nvisiting the Knesset for a discussion about fixing Israel’s broken electoral system.\nIn the audience was a member of one of the civic associations pressing for reform:\nNili Priell, my first, and only, serious girlfriend before I met Nava. We spoke for a\nfew minutes afterwards. We agreed to meet again, and catch up with each other’s\nlives, a week or so later. Both of us now had grown children. We were both on our\nown. There is, I assume for everyone, something impossible to replicate about a\nfirst love. Nili and I were given an unlikely second chance. That seemed to me an\nextraordinary gift. It still does.\n\nYet if my personal life seemed full of new promise, the same could not be said\nof the country I’d served for my whole adult life, or of the political party I'd led\ninto government. The continuing construction of the security fence along the West\nBank finally did begin to reduce the sheer number of Palestinian attacks: from\nnearly 50 in 2002, to about half that number in 2003. But the suicide bombers who\ndid get through — from Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Fatah’s “Al-Aqsa Martyrs’\n\n396\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028244\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

And as discussed earlier in this chapter, we forecast the U.S. legal cannabis market to\nreach more than $100 billion in this same period. Together, these two forecasts indicate a global legal\ncannabis market in the foreseeable future of more than $300 billion.\n\nIn our view, most countries located in Asia will take the longest to enact and implement cannabis\naccess laws; therefore, we have not included the markets in countries such as China, with a population\nof 1.4 billion people, or Japan, with the third highest GDP in the world, in our global market estimate.\nIf cannabis legalization continues in the United States and the rest of the world as we anticipate, we\nbelieve that many countries in Asia will ultimately follow suit. If and when that occurs, the size of the\nglobal legal cannabis market will increase significantly and, we believe, may ultimately exceed $500\nbillion annually.\n\nAs discussed on page 175, readers are cautioned to not place undue reliance on our opinions, pre-\ndictions or estimates.

A number of factors could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those\nindicated by our opinions, predictions and estimates.

Instead, the foursome set out that morning with\njust two men per car, each vehicle missing their rear gunner. The SUVs were only outfitted with a\nsteel plate as extra armor.

The federal non-prosecution agreement Epstein’s legal\nteam negotiated with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida immunized all named and\nunnamed \"potential co-conspirators\" in Epstein's child trafficking network, which includes those who\nallegedly procured minors for Epstein and also any powerbrokers who may have molested them” (-\nhttp://gawker.com/flight-logs-put-clinton-dershowitz-on-ped...).

From our earliest days,\nthere was an understanding that you used whatever force necessary in order to\nmake an operation successful.

Israel’s next election, the first since the Lebanon war, was due in\nJuly. Just as the trauma of the 1973 war had helped Begin end Likud’s three\ndecades in opposition, the polls and the pundits were now suggesting that\nShimon Peres might bring Labor back to power. There was no prospect he’d\nwin an outright majority in the 120-seat Knesset. No one had ever done that, not\neven Ben-Gurion in his political heyday. From 1948, Israel’s political landscape\nhad been populated by at least a dozen-or-so parties, mostly a reflection of the\nvarious Zionist and religious groups before the state was established. The\ndominant party always needed to make deals with some of the smaller ones to\nget the required 60-vote parliamentary majority and form a government.\n\nThe Likud looked vulnerable. Domestic concerns, alone, were eroding its\nsupport. Under Begin’s turbo-charged version of Milton Freedman economics,\nan economic boom had given way to runaway inflation and a stock market\ncrash. Lebanon, however, was the main issue, and it remained a running\npolitical sore. The assassinated Bashir Gemayel’s brother, Amin Gemayel, had\nbecome president. But Israel still had large numbers of troops there. And while\nmost of the PLO fighters had gone, we faced a new and potentially even more\nintractable enemy in the south of the country. When our invasion began, the\narea’s historically disadvantaged Shi’ite Muslim majority had been the one\ngroup besides the Christians with the prospect of benefiting.

This clearly falsified the historical record. Far\nfrom suppressing Chamberlain's actions, historians and\npoliticians alike have held up the Munich agreement\n\nas a symbol of all that went wrong due to the European\ndemocracies’ appeasement of Hitler.”\n\nPutin has also justified the Hitler-Stalin pact on the\ngrounds that it kept the Soviet Union out of war for a\ntime and was in keeping with the amoral power politics\npracticed in that era. As for the divvying up of Eastern\nEurope, he repeated the hoary lie that the record was\nunclear as to whether the pact’'s secret protocols—in\nwhich the two parties agreed on which territories each\nwould subsequently control—were genuine.’ Predict-\nably, Putin did not go into the unwritten parts of the\nagreement that caused Stalin to forcibly repatriate a\ngroup of German dissidents, mostly Communists, who\nhad sought refuge in the Soviet Union.\n\nBoth the history manual and the political leadership\njustify the transformation of postwar Eastern Europe\ninto a Soviet-controlled bloc—in which the econ-\nomy came under state control, religious belief was\npersecuted, civil society was destroyed, the press was\nconverted into a monolithic instrument of propagan-\nda, and opposition political parties were crushed—by\nclaiming that Moscow needed a layer of territorial\nsecurity to protect it from the hostile West. “Historical\nnecessity” is how Putin’s spokesman described Soviet\ndomination of the region. Putin likewise blames the\ndemocracies for the Iron Curtain: “We understand the\nfatality of an ‘iron curtain’ for us. We will not go down\nthis path. No one will build a wall around us.”\n\nThe manual recalls Mikhail Gorbachev not for his\nattempts to reform and liberalize the Communist\nsystem, but instead for his having permitted the\nunraveling of the European security belt in 1989 and\nthe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Moving into\nthe 21st century, the manual denounces the color\nrevolutions in neighboring countries like Georgia\nand Ukraine as Western-backed schemes to replace\npro-Russian leaders with pro-American usurpers. In\nthis view, the centuries may change and the Soviet\nempire may fade into history, but Russia's geopolitical\npredicament remains constant.\n\nSakharov as nonperson\nBecause Putin is intent on blaming the West for Rus-\nsias problems, both past and present, he has worked\n\nto ensure that critical domestic voices are removed\nfrom Russian history. This explains the near total ab-\nsence of Andrey Sakharov from any discussion of the\nSoviet past or Russia's future course.\n\nToday Sakharov is recalled abroad as a dissident and\nNobel Peace Prize laureate. In Russia, however, he\nhas been relegated to the status of nonperson. Putin\nand other leaders never refer to him, his legacy, or\n\nhis views. The organizations that were launched to\npromote his principles are harassed and placed on the\n“foreign agents’ list.*° In an age of flourishing digital\nmedia, Russians are ironically less likely to know what\nSakharov stood for than was the case under Soviet\ncensorship, when underground samizdat literature\nwas reproduced on manual typewriters to reach an\naudience of a few hundred.\n\nIn fact, Sakharov was an imposing global presence\nfrom the mid-1960s until his death in 1989. His stat-\nure derived from his prominent role in the develop-\nment of the Soviet nuclear arsenal. He was sometimes\ncalled the “father of the hydrogen bomb,” and because\nof the respect he enjoyed in the global scientific com-\nmunity, his views on arms control carried enormous\nweight.\n\nHis initial forays into political dissent consisted of cau-\ntious statements about the importance of weapons\ntreaties between Washington and Moscow. But the\nmore he thought about arms control, the more closely\nhe looked at his own society. And soon he was making\ncaustic comments about the yawning gap between\nSoviet boasts on the achievements of socialism and\nthe reality of Soviet backwardness.\n\nHe eventually came to see the system that prevailed\nin the Soviet Union as inherently repressive. Sakharov\nattributed Russia's epidemic of alcoholism to the\nleadership's having purged the governing system of\nmoral considerations. He said it was “important that\nour society gradually emerge from the dead end of\nunspirituality.” He spoke of the need for the “system-\natic defense of human rights and ideals, and not a\npolitical struggle, which would inevitably incite people\nto violence, sectarianism, and frenzy.\"\n\nThe Kremlin has worked hard to make Russians forget\nthat he once ranked among the eminent figures of\nglobal political protest. The current leadership is\nespecially determined to ensure that Sakharov's core\ngoals disappear from the debate: a Russia committed\nto humane and democratic values, a government that\n\n30\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019264\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Objective: an alliance between \nright-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections \nNEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru who was \nDonald Trump's right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following the racist \nviolence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the Daily Beast \nhimself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (II Movimento), right in the heart of Europe \nand its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the European \nelections which will be held in spring 2019. \nObjective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor of the \nDemocratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in support of \nNGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist right, accused of \nplots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to have labour at \nlow cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the Interior Matteo \nSalvini. \nThe ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in the \nEuropean campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and Rome \n— is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great \"populist international\" of which he has long \nsince been dreaming. \nThe Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic \nadvice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European movements. \nAnalysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling funding. \nThe aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of \"super group\" that if victorious can conquer up to a third \nof the European Parliament in the elections next May. \nIndeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The \nAmerican strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress — \nand in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data stolen from \nFacebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump emerged victor. It is not \na mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West. And he has already \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019302 \nmet, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and the former leader of the British \nseparatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on Friday in Pennsylvania, USA, to a \nfundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. Without forgetting the Italians of Lega \nand 5 stars. Of them, he said: \"If it works in Italy, we can import the model anywhere\". \nThe Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. In \nshort, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries \nsupporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But in the \nfuture the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also because the \nrelationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff and published in \nthe scandal book \"Fire and Fury\". \"Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Paradise,\" Bannon says now \nparaphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost Paradise. Hell in this case would \nbe the dear old Europe and its democratic values.

He is the author of eleven books,\nincluding The Blank Slate, The Better Angels of Our Nature, and, most recently,\nEnlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress.\n\nArtificial intelligence is an existence proof of one of the great ideas in human history:\nthat the abstract realm of knowledge, reason, and purpose does not consist of an élan vital\nor immaterial soul or miraculous powers of neural tissue. Rather, it can be linked to the\nphysical realm of animals and machines via the concepts of information, computation,\nand control. Knowledge can be explained as patterns in matter or energy that stand in\nsystematic relations with states of the world, with mathematical and logical truths, and\nwith one another. Reasoning can be explained as transformations of that knowledge by\nphysical operations that are designed to preserve those relations. Purpose can be\nexplained as the control of operations to effect changes in the world, guided by\ndiscrepancies between its current state and a goal state. Naturally evolved brains are just\nthe most familiar systems that achieve intelligence through information, computation, and\ncontrol. Humanly designed systems that achieve intelligence vindicate the notion that\ninformation processing is sufficient to explain it—the notion that the late Jerry Fodor\ndubbed the computational theory of mind.\n\nThe touchstone for this volume, Norbert Wiener’s The Human Use of Human\nBeings, celebrated this intellectual accomplishment, of which Wiener himself was a\nfoundational contributor. A potted history of the mid-20th-century revolution that gave\nthe world the computational theory of mind might credit Claude Shannon and Warren\nWeaver for explaining knowledge and communication in terms of information. It might\ncredit Alan Turing and John von Neumann for explaining intelligence and reasoning in\nterms of computation. And it ought to give Wiener credit for explaining the hitherto\nmysterious world of purposes, goals, and teleology in terms of the technical concepts of\nfeedback, control, and cybernetics (in its original sense of “governing” the operation of a\ngoal-directed system). “It is my thesis,” he announced, “that the physical functioning of\nthe living individual and the operation of some of the newer communication machines are\nprecisely parallel in their analogous attempts to control entropy through feedback”—the\nstaving off of life-sapping entropy being the ultimate goal of human beings.\n\nWiener applied the ideas of cybernetics to a third system: society. The laws,\nnorms, customs, media, forums, and institutions of a complex community could be\nconsidered channels of information propagation and feedback that allow a society to ward\noff disorder and pursue certain goals. This is a thread that runs through the book and\nwhich Wiener himself may have seen as its principal contribution. In his explanation of\nfeedback, he wrote, “This complex of behavior is ignored by the average man, and in\nparticular does not play the role that it should in our habitual analysis of society; for just\nas individual physical responses may be seen from this point of view, so may the organic\nresponses of society itself.”\n\n77\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016297\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

The result\nwas an emotional outpouring of horror and indignation from liberal media, terror in\nimmigrant communities, tumultuous protests at major airports, confusion throughout the\ngovernment, and, in the White House, an inundation of lectures, warnings, and\nopprobrium from friends and family.

Objective: an alliance between \nright-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections \nNEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru who \nwas Donald Trump's right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following the \nracist violence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the Daily \nBeast himself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (II Movimento), right in the heart \nof Europe and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the \nEuropean elections which will be held in spring 2019. \nObjective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor of \nthe Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in support \nof NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist right, \naccused of plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to \nhave labour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the \nInterior Matteo Salvini. \nThe ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in \nthe European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and \nRome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great \"populist international\" of which he \nhas long since been dreaming. \nThe Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic \nadvice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European \nmovements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling \nfunding. \nThe aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of \"super group\" that if victorious can conquer up to a \nthird of the European Parliament in the elections next May. \nIndeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The \nAmerican strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress \n— and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data \nstolen from Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump emerged \nvictor. It is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West. \nAnd he has already met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and the \nformer leader of the British separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on Friday \nin Pennsylvania, USA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. Without \nforgetting the Italians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: \"If it works in Italy, we can import the \nmodel anywhere\". \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019317 \nThe Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. In \nshort, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries \nsupporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But in \nthe future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also because \nthe relationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff and \npublished in the scandal book \"Fire and Fury\". \"Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Paradise,\" \nBannon says now paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost Paradise. \nHell in this case would be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The \"army of darkness\" is \nalready among us. \nIn Sacratissimo Corde Iesu et Purissimo Corde Mariae et Castissimo Corde Ioseph. \n******* \nBenjamin Harnwell \nFounder and President of the Board of Trustees \nDignitatis Humanae Institute \nCell: \nOfficl \nIstituto Dignitatis Humanae \n44 Via delle Fornaci  \nRoma 00165  \nITALY  \n@ben harnwell \nwww.dignitatishumanae.com \nII giorno 22 lug 2018, alle ore 15:38, Steve Bannon < > ha scritto: \nWhat does this say??? \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: Maria Luisa < \nDate: July 22, 2018 at 9:11:58 AM EDT \nTo: Steve Bannon < \n=IIII \n<PHOTO-2018-07-22-10-02-17.jpg> \n> \n, Preate Alexandra \n> \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019318 \nSent from my iPhone \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

This strikes me as embarrassingly lame, given that we can\ncreate amazing opportunities for humanity to flourish like never before, if we dare to\nsteer a more ambitious course.\n\n13.8 billion years after its birth, our Universe has become aware of itself. On a\nsmall blue planet, tiny conscious parts of our Universe have discovered that what they\nonce thought was the sum total of existence was a minute part of something far grander: a\nsolar system in a galaxy in a universe with over 100 billion other galaxies, arranged into\nan elaborate pattern of groups, clusters, and superclusters.\n\nConsciousness is the cosmic awakening; it transformed our Universe from a\nmindless zombie with no self-awareness into a living ecosystem harboring self-reflection,\nbeauty, hope, meaning, and purpose. Had that awakening never taken place, our\nUniverse would have been pointless—a gigantic waste of space. Should our Universe go\nback to sleep permanently due to some cosmic calamity or self-inflicted mishap, it will\nbecome meaningless again.\n\nOn the other hand, things could get even better. We don’t yet know whether we\nhumans are the only stargazers in the cosmos, or even the first, but we’ve already learned\nenough about our Universe to know that it has the potential to wake up much more fully\nthan it has thus far. AI pioneers such as Norbert Wiener have taught us that a further\nawakening of our Universe’s ability to process and experience information need not\nrequire eons of additional evolution but perhaps mere decades of human scientific\ningenuity.\n\nWe may be like that first glimmer of self-awareness you experienced when you\nemerged from sleep this morning, a premonition of the much greater consciousness that\nwould arrive once you opened your eyes and fully awoke. Perhaps artificial\nsuperintelligence will enable life to spread throughout the cosmos and flourish for\nbillions or trillions of years, and perhaps this will be because of decisions we make here,\non our planet, in our lifetime.\n\nOr humanity may soon go extinct, through some self-inflicted calamity caused by\nthe power of our technology growing faster than the wisdom with which we manage it.\n\nThe evolving debate about AI’s societal impact\n\nMany thinkers dismiss the idea of superintelligence as science fiction, because they view\nintelligence as something mysterious that can exist only in biological organisms—\nespecially humans—and as fundamentally limited to what today’s humans can do.

An American man’s story.\nBut now such stories have crossed a political line. The American man story is a right-wing\nstory. Bannon found his models in political infighters like Lee Atwater, Roger Ailes, Karl\nRove. All were larger-than-life American characters doing battle with conformity and\nmodernity, relishing ways to violate liberal sensibilities.\n\nThe other point is that Bannon, however smart and even charismatic, however much he\nextolled the virtue of being a “stand-up guy,” was not necessarily a nice guy. Several\ndecades as a grasping entrepreneur without a satisfying success story doesn’t smooth the\nhustle in hustler. One competitor in the conservative media business, while acknowledging\nhis intelligence and the ambitiousness of his ideas, also noted, “He’s mean, dishonest, and\nincapable of caring about other people. His eyes dart around like he’s always looking for a\nweapon with which to bludgeon or gouge you.”\n\nConservative media fit not only his angry, contrarian, and Roman Catholic side, but it\nhad low barriers to entry—tiberal media, by contrast, with its corporate hierarchies, was\nmuch harder to break into. What’s more, conservative media is a highly lucrative target\nmarket category, with books (often dominating the bestseller lists), videos, and other\nproducts available through direct sales avenues that can circumvent more expensive\ndistribution channels.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Bannon became a purveyor of conservative books products and\nmedia. His partner in this enterprise was David Bossie, the far-right pamphleteer and\ncongressional committee investigator into the Clintons’ Whitewater affair, who would join\nhim as deputy campaign manager on the Trump campaign. Bannon met Breitbart News\nfounder Andrew Breitbart at a screening of one of the Bannon-Bossie documentaries Jn\nthe Face of Evil (billed as “Ronald Reagan’s crusade to destroy the most tyrannical and\ndepraved political systems the world has ever known”), which in turn led to a relationship\nwith the man who offered Bannon the ultimate opportunity: Robert Mercer.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nIn this regard, Bannon was not so much an entrepreneur of vision or even business\ndiscipline, he was more simply following the money—or trying to separate a fool from his\nmoney.

I said we needed to remind ourselves of the\narmy’s purpose: to protect Israel’s security and, if a war came, to win it. My\nbudgetary rule of thumb over the next four years would be simple: anything that\ndidn’t directly contribute to that mission was expendable. In fact, I put it a bit\nmore bluntly: “We need to cut anything that doesn’t shoot.”\n\nMy first attempt failed utterly. I proposed to close, or sell off, the army’s\nradio station, Galei Tzahal. Running it cost serious money. If we were going to\ncut everything that didn’t shoot, it was an obvious candidate. But what I failed\nto take into account was its popularity with the listening public. Although other\nradio stations had opened recently, for many years it had been the only major\nalternative to the state-funded Kol Yisrael. It also provided a training ground\nand employment feeder for future journalists. Galei Tzahal’s alumni included\nsome of the country’s top media figures, and more than a few members of the\nKnesset. Within weeks, a lobbying effort was underway to “save” the station. I\nwent to see Misha. He agreed that, from a military and budgetary standpoint,\nclosing it was the right thing to do. But in an early lesson in how different\npolitics were from the army, he told me that politically, it simply wasn’t going\nto fly. “Drop it, Ehud,” he said. So I did.\n\nStill, I did end up fundamentally retooling the armed forces during my time\nas chief of staff. We developed agile new strike forces and high-precision, high-\ntech weapons systems with “stand-off” munitions designed to be fired from\nmany miles away. In the 1973 war, and for the decade or two that followed,\nSaggers, and the US-made TOW missiles that Israel acquired after the war, had\nthe capability to transform a battlefield. Now, Israeli developers came up with\nsmall, ground-launched missiles that could take out a tank from five to 10 miles\naway, even without a direct line of sight to the target. Of even more long-term\nmilitary significance, I pushed ahead with developing pilotless drones — so-\ncalled UAVs — making us the first army in the world to produce and deploy\nthem.\n\nYet for a security challenge like the intifada, even the most advanced stand-\noff munitions or UAVs offered no practical answer. The latest stage in the\nviolence involved knife attacks by Palestinians against Israeli civilians, both on\nWest Bank settlers and inside Israel. Days after I took over, a 26-year-old from\nGaza, wielding a butcher’s knife and shouting Alahu Akhbar, killed four people,\n\n243\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028091\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Real estate was the world's favorite money laundering currency and Trump's \nperceived A -level real estate business was quite explicitly designed to appeal to money \nlaunderers. What's more, Trump's own financial woes, and desperate efforts to maintain \nbillionaire lifestyle, cache, and market viability, forced him into constant and unsubtle \nschemes. Practically speaking, you couldn't miss him, as the Mueller investigation \nappeared to be finding. \nIn November 2004, for instance, Jeffrey Epstein, the financier later caught in a scandal \ninvolving under-age prostitutes, agreed to buy out of bankruptcy a house in Palm Beach, \nFlorida for $36 million—a house that had been on the market for two years. Epstein and \nTrump had been close friends—playboys in arms, as it were—for more than a decade, \nwith Trump always hopeful that Epstein would provide some of his financial expertise to \nenabvle h8im to survive. Trump was beholden to Deutsch Bank and was on the hook \npersonally for 40 million dollars. \nEpstein took Trump to see the Palm Beach house to advise him on construction issues \ninvolved with moving the swimming pool. As he prepared to finalize his deal for the \nhouse, an incredulous Epstein saw a severely cash-constrained Trump bid $41 million for \nthe property, buying it through an entity named Trump Properties LLC, ultimate owner \nunknown.. Trump, Epstein knew, had been in the buisness of leasing his name. Hotels are \nactually owned by others but renting the trump name would cost a percent or two. , \nTrump was willing to serve as a front man to disguise the actual ownership in a real estate \ntransaction. (This was, in effect, just another variation of Trump's basic business model of \nlicensing his name for commercial properties owned by someone else.) A furious Epstein \nsuspected that others actually owned the new house. then getting extensive scrutiny in \nFlorida papers. The disagreement re the purchase of the house became all the more bitter \nwhen, two months later, the house was put on the market for $125 million. Well known to \nTrump, who often visited with Epstein at his Palm Beach house, whose visits were \nconfirmed in depostions of Epsteins houseman. It appears that Epstein was visited almost \nevery day, by and had been for many years, by girls who he paid for massages with happy \nendings—girls recruited, and who often returned to his house from the local massage \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030974 \nparlors strip clubs, and, also, Trump's Mar-a-Lago. Just as the threats and enmity of the \ntwo friends increased over the house sale, Epstein found himself under investigation by \nlocal Palm Beach police. Epstein's legal problems vastly escalated but the new Trump \nproperty, with only minor improvements, was bought 3 years later in 08 , the time \nTrump was facing his huge debt. for $96 million by Dmitry Rybolovlev. a Russain oligarch. \nThat is, Trump had either miraculously earned $55 million, without putting up a dime, or \nRybolovlev, or someone such as Rybolovlev, paid Trump Properties, LLC—actual owner \nunknown—$96 million, thereby providing a clean payment of $55 million to \nsomeone. This at the very same time that trump was into Deutsch bank for over 600 \nmillion dollars but with a 40 millino personal guarnatee .Rybolovlev might have, in effect, \npaid himself for the house, thereby cleansing the money. Epstein, on his part, would be \nsenetenced to 30 months, 12 of those months in jail on a prostitution charge. \nAfter the election, when Bannon was introduced to Epstein, Bannon told him, \"You were \nthe one person I was truly afraid of coming forward during the campaign.\" \n\"not surprising\" said Epstein. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

Long story short, I decided to work at home despite\nfeeling terrible. So here’s the funny part. I thought I would get nothing done, but ended up finishing three\nmore designs than usual on both days. Plus, I put in three more billable hours than usual without the\ncommute, office noise, distractions, etc. OK, so here’s where I’m going. Just as a trial, I’d like to\npropose working from home Mondays and Tuesdays for just two weeks. You can veto it whenever you\nwant, and I’ll come in if we need to do meetings, but I'd like to try it for just two weeks and review the\nresults. ’m 100% confident that Pll get twice as much done. Does that seem reasonable?\n\nBill: Hmm ... What if we need to share client designs?\n\nSherwood: There’s a program called GoToMyPC that I used to access the office computer when I was\nsick. I can view everything remotely, and I'll have my cell phone on me 24/7. Sooooo ... What do you\nthink? Test it out starting next Monday and see how much more I get done?&\n\nBill: Ummm ... OK, fine. But it’s just a test. I have a meeting in five and have to run, but let’s talk\nsoon.\n\nSherwood: Great. Thanks for the time. [ll keep you posted on it all. ’'m sure you'll be pleasantly\nsurprised.\n\nSherwood didn’t expect to get two days per week approved. He asked for two so that, in the case his\nboss refused, he could ask for just one as a fallback position (bracketing). Why didn’t Sherwood go for\nfive days remote per week? Two reasons. First, it’s a lot for management to accept off the bat. We need\nto ask for an inch and turn it into a foot without setting off panic alarms. Second, it is a good idea to\nhone your remote-working abilities—rehearse a bit—before shooting for the big time, as it decreases the\nlikelihood of crises and screwups that will get remote rights revoked.\n\nStep 5: Expand Remote Time\n\nSherwood ensures that his days outside of the office are his most productive to date, even minimally\ndropping in-office production to heighten the contrast. He sets a meeting to discuss the results with his\nboss on August 15 and prepares a bullet-point page detailing increased results and items completed\ncompared to in-office time. He suggests upping the ante to four days per week remote for a two-week\ntrial, fully prepared to concede to three days if need be.\n\nSherwood: It really turned out even better than I expected. If you look at the numbers, it makes a lot of\nbusiness sense, and I’m enjoying work a lot more now. So, here we are. I'd like to suggest, if you think it\nmakes sense, that I try four days a week for another two-week trial. I was thinking that coming in\n\nFriday®would make sense to prepare for the coming week, but we could do whichever day you prefer.\n\nBill: Sherwood, I’m really not sure we can do that.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013942\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Every issue that was debated in public was debated in our office before this case\nwent to the grand jury.\"\n\nIn this case, it is not the victims’ credibility but the state attorney's that deserves\nquestioning.\n\nPalm Beach Post Editorial #2\n\nMassaging the system\n\nPalm Beach Post Editorial\n\nThursday, August 10, 2006\n\nPalm Beach police say their 11-month investigation shows that 53-year-old part-time\ntown resident Jeffrey Epstein committed unlawful sex acts with and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation on five underage girls. Defense attorney Jack Goldberger claims that his\nclient, Jeffrey Epstein, had no idea that the untrained girls he hired for massages were\nminors.\n\nThe Palm Beach Count State Attorney's Office could have let a jury decide whom to\nbelieve. Instead, State Attorney Barry Krischer left the public to wonder whether the\nsystem tilted in favor of a wealthy, well-connected alleged perpetrator and against very\nyoung girls who are alleged victims of sex crimes.\n\nMr. Krischer took the unusual step of referring the case to a grand jury, which last month\nindicted Jeffrey Epstein on one felony count of solicitation of prostitution. That decision\ncame after Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz met with prosecutors to undermine\nthe credibility of the 14- to 17-yearold girls who charged that Mr. Epstein had paid them\n$200 to $300 to undress and massage him in his five-bedroom, 7 1/2 -bath home on the\nIntracoastal Waterway.\n\nThe girls, Mr. Dershowitz told prosecutors, had written on myspace.com about smoking\nmarijuana and drinking alcohol. But if the girls have a credibility problem, what about\nJeffrey Epstein? Mr. Goldberger, told The Post: \"Mr. Epstein absolutely insisted anybody\nwho came to his house be over the age of 18. How he verified that, I don't know.\" And\nprosecutors took him at his word?\n\nPolice collected evidence that refutes Jeffrey Epstein’s defense. Police searched his home\nand garbage and found phone messages about the girls’ school schedules and even a high\nschool transcript, suggesting that Mr. Epstein at least knew that the girls were teenagers.\nThe state attorney's office has responded to criticism from Palm Beach police and others\nby noting the higher standard prosecutors face for conviction than law-enforcement\nofficers do for arrest. But in this case, the state attorney bowed to the risk that a jury\nmight look at both Jeffrey Epstein and the girls, and point fingers at both sides.\n\nEven if the girls could be impugned as prostitutes, solicitation of a minor is a crime.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021796\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He was concerned about human-made restrictions as well as\ntechnological ones, especially Cold War restrictions that threatened the flow of\ninformation so critical to cybernetic systems: “Under the impetus of Senator [Joseph]\nMcCarthy and his imitators, the blind and excessive classification of military\ninformation” was driving political leaders in the United States to adopt a “secretive frame\nof mind paralleled in history only in the Venice of the Renaissance.” Wiener, echoing\nmany outspoken veterans of the Manhattan Project, argued that the postwar obsession\nwith secrecy—especially around nuclear weapons—stemmed from a misunderstanding of\nthe scientific process. The only genuine secret about the production of nuclear weapons,\nhe wrote, was whether such bombs could be built. Once that secret had been revealed,\nwith the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, no amount of state-imposed secrecy\nwould stop others from puzzling through chains of reasoning like those the Manhattan\nProject researchers had followed. As Wiener memorably put it, “There is no Maginot\nLine of the brain.”\n\nTo drive this point home, Wiener borrowed Shannon’s fresh ideas about\ninformation theory. In 1948, Shannon, a mathematician and engineer working at Bell\nLabs, had published a pair of lengthy articles in the Be// System Technical Journal.\nIntroducing the new work to a broad readership in 1949, mathematician Warren Weaver\nexplained that in Shannon’s formulation, “the word information...is used in a special\nsense that must not be confused with its ordinary usage. In particular, information must\nnot be confused with meaning.”?! Linguists and poets might be concerned about the\n“semantic” aspects of communication, Weaver continued, but not engineers like\nShannon. Rather, “this word ‘information’ in communication theory relates not so much\nto what you do say, as to what you could say.” In Shannon’s now-famous formulation,\nthe information content of a string of symbols was given by the logarithm of the number\nof possible symbols from which a given string was chosen. Shannon’s key insight was\nthat the information of a message was just like the entropy of a gas: a measure of the\nsystem’s disorder.\n\nWiener borrowed this insight when composing Human Use. If information was\nlike entropy, then it could not be conserved—or contained. Physicists in the 19th century\nhad demonstrated that the total energy of a physical system must always remain the same,\na perfect balance between the start and the end of a process. Not so for entropy, which\nwould inexorably increase over time, an imperative that came to be known as the second\nlaw of thermodynamics. From that stark distinction—energy is conserved, whereas\nentropy must grow—followed enormous cosmic consequences. Time must flow forward;\n\n3° Norbert Wiener, “A Scientist Rebels,” Zhe Atlantic Monthly, January 1947.\n\n31 Warren Weaver, “Recent Contributions to the Mathematical Theory of Communication,” in Claude\nShannon & Warren Weaver, The Mathematical Theory of Communication (Urbana, IL: University of\nIllinois Press, 1949), p. 8 (emphasis in original).

Although they form a vital strand in the social fabric of the United\nStates, Beijing also views Chinese Americans as members of a worldwide Chinese diaspora\nthat, whatever the actual citizenship of individuals may be, presumes them to retain\n\nnot only an interest in the welfare of China but also a loosely defined cultural, and even\npolitical, allegiance to the so-called Motherland (#4). Under Xi Jinping’s leadership,\ndiaspora Chinese have been called on to help achieve the Rejuvenation of the Chinese\nNation—a summons that places growing pressure on ethnic Chinese around the world to\nserve the “China Dream” (#8). While many overseas Chinese do feel pride in China as a\ncountry and the Chinese as a race, Beijing’s claims on their loyalty can have the untoward\neffect of calling into question their devotion to their own home nations.\n\nUnder both the Nationalist and Communist parties, overseas Chinese have played an\nimportant role in modern Chinese politics as well as in China’s relations with the outside\nworld. Diaspora communities worldwide have been key sources of legitimacy and support\nfor whatever government held power in Beijing, but just as often they have been centers of\nantigovernment agitation. With PRC influence-seeking activities now expanding, China’s\nlong-standing focus on diaspora communities has also intensified to become an important\nelement in overall US-China relations. Such trends demand not only greater societal\nattention and understanding but also an appropriate response from the US government\nas well as non-governmental institutions.\n\nAs the Chinese Communist Party seeks to encourage, even entice, ethnic-Chinese\ncommunities and individuals overseas to more fully support its interests, the Chinese\nAmericans in the United States and other free societies need to better inform themselves\nas to the nature of this dynamic, and our governmental institutions may need to do more\nto defend their freedoms against harmfully intrusive and coercive activities. At the same\ntime, it is essential that we not allow overseas Chinese as an ethnic group to fall under\nany kind indiscriminate cloud of suspicion. Above all, it is important to bear in mind\nthat while ethnic Chinese can be quite naturally expected to take an interest in things\nChinese, it is the Chinese Communist Party that puts a target on their backs through its\npresumption that they are all somehow the “sons and daughters of the Yellow Emperor”\n(KTP) and thus owe some measure of loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020488\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

They whisper that he's embroiled in a messy divorce.\n\nReiter did in fact file for divorce from his wife, (NAME REMOVED), last year, after 24\nyears of marriage. They have a son, 18, and a daughter, 14. The couple is scheduled to go\nto mediation next week, Aug. 16. Nothing in the court file suggests their split is\nparticularly ugly.\n\nReiter incurred the wrath of the Epstein camp as well as the state attorney's office for two\nreasons. First, he pressed for Epstein to be charged with the more serious crimes of\nsexual activity with minors. Second, he slammed State Attorney Barry Krischer in blunt\nlanguage seldom used by one law-enforcement official concerning another because of\nwhat he perceived as that office's mishandling of the case.\n\nIn a letter to Krischer written May 1, Reiter called his actions in the Epstein case \"highly\nunusual.\" He added, \"I must urge you to... consider if good and sufficient reason exists to\nrequire your disqualification from the prosecution of these cases.\" In short, Reiter told\nthe county's top prosecutor for the past 13 years that he ought to get off the case. \"It\nlooks like a departure from professionalism,\" Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine\nFernandez Rundle said of Reiter's letter.\n\nFollowing Epstein's indictment, Reiter referred the case to the FBI to determine whether\nthe super-rich, super-connected defendant had violated any federal laws. Reiter won't\ndiscuss the case or the broadsides aimed at him. But others almost uniformly use one\nword to describe the chief: professional.\n\n\"I have always been impressed by Mike's professionalism and his leadership,\" said Rick\nLincoln, chief of the Lantana Police Department and a Palm Beach County cop for 32\nyears. \"The town of Palm Beach has a very professional police department. We all\nconsider Mike to be our peer and a man of integrity.\" Juno Beach Police Chief H.C.\nClark II agreed. Although he doesn't know Reiter well, he has met with him on\ncountywide law enforcement issues. \"I've never seen him lose his cool. I've never seen\nanything but a professional demeanor from him.\"\n\nReiter joined the Palm Beach Police Department in 1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year patrol\njob at the University of Pittsburgh. His personnel jacket shows consistently excellent job\nevaluations. Posh Palm Beach is no hotbed of crime, and in his first year on the job, a\nresident confined to his home with a sick child thanked Reiter for delivering a few Cokes\nto the house. Reiter refused payment for the beverages. Another resident thanked Reiter\nfor shutting off his car's headlights in his driveway, saying a valet must have been at\nfault. Reiter worked everything from road patrol to organized crime, vice and narcotics.\n\nAnd he's no novice at investigations involving the island's rich and famous. He was the\nlead detective probing the drug overdose death of David Kennedy in 1984. He also was\none of the officers who worked the investigation of William Kennedy Smith, who was\ncharged in 1991 — and later acquitted — with raping a woman at the Kennedy family\ncompound in Palm Beach.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021782\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It triggers its pursuit function,\nwhich consists of the simplest possible rules. First, move in a random direction. If the\nscent increases, continue moving in that direction. If the scent decreases, move in the\nopposite direction. If the scent is lost, move sideways until a scent is picked up again.\nRepeat until contact with the target is achieved.\n\nThe plume of my scent is densest next to me and disperses as it spreads, an\ninvisible fog of particles exuded from my skin that moves like smoke with the wind. The\ncloser to my skin, the higher the particle density; the farther away, the lower. This\ndecrease 1s called a gradient, which describes any gradual transition from one level to\nanother one—as opposed to a “step function,” which describes a discrete change.\n\nOnce the mosquito follows this gradient to its source using its simple algorithm, it\nlands on my skin, which it senses with the heat detectors in its feet, which are attuned to\nanother gradient—temperature. It then pushes its needle-shaped proboscis through the\nsurface, where a third set of sensors in the tip detect yet another gradient, that of blood\ndensity. This flexible needle wriggles around under my skin until the scent of blood\nsteers it to a capillary, which it punctures. Then my blood begins to flow into the\nmosquito. Mission accomplished. Ouch.\n\nWhat seems like the powerful radar of insects in the dark, with blood-seeking\nintelligence inexplicable for such tiny brains, is actually just a sensitive nose with almost\nno intelligence at all. Mosquitoes are closer to plants that follow the sun than to guided\nmissiles. Yet by applying this simple “follow your nose” rule quite literally, they can\ntravel through a house to find you, slip through cracks in a screen door, even zero in on\nthe tiny strip of skin you left exposed between hat and shirt collar. It’s just a random\nwalk, combined with flexible wings and legs that let the insect bounce off obstacles, and\nan instinct to descend a chemical gradient.\n\nBut “gradient descent” is much more than bug navigation. Look around you and\nyou'll find it everywhere, from the most basic physical rules of the universe to the most\nadvanced artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Universe\n\nWe live in a world of countless gradients, from light and heat to gravity and chemical\ntrails (chemtrails!). Water flows along a gravity gradient downhill, and your body lives\non chemical solutions flowing across cell membranes from high concentration to\n\nlow. Every action in the universe 1s driven by some gradient drive, from the movement\nof the planets around gravity gradients to the joining of atoms along electric-charge\ngradients to form molecules. Our own urges, such as hunger and sleepiness, are driven\nby electro-chemical gradients in our bodies. And our brain’s functions, the electrical\nsignals moving along ion channels in the synapses between our neurons, are simply\natoms and electrons flowing “downhill” along yet more electrical and chemical gradients.\n\n104\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016907\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Flows are to stocks as verbs to\nnouns. Percent rates are flows divided by stocks, as rate of return or growth rate,\n\nand are measured in pure numbers over time such as 5% per year.\n\nNow for the fundamental theorems. Take the present value rule first. It starts from\nthe axiom that we satisfy convergent tastes in the light of convergent predictions. In\na simple case, we foresee that an asset (stock) is likely to yield a certain amount of\ntaste satisfaction flow at a certain future time. We discount that expected amount at\na time preference or time discount rate given by our taste for impatience, tempered\nby our taste for risk avoidance, to find its present value. Present value of the whole\n\nasset is the sum of present values of all the expected future satisfactions together.\n\nA more general case allows for transfers. The future events we foresee and discount\nare not always exhaust in taste satisfaction by ourselves at the time. Some might be\nforeseen liquidations to reinvest in other assets or to give away so that we or the\ndonee can realize the taste satisfaction later. Either reinvestment or gift is called\n\ntransfer. I call it “transfer out”, meaning out from the generating asset. Then\n\ntransfer out = reinvestment + gift. (3.1)\n\nThere can also be transfer in. Sometimes future realizations, in taste satisfaction or\ntransfer out, are not explained as production by the asset as it is now. The asset\nmight grow later by new investment from outside, and the investment in between\nmight help explain the later yield.

Through Unit 8200 in\nmilitary intelligence, we would only very occasionally get verbatim transcripts\nof his conversations as he brought first the Saudis and other Gulf states on\nboard, then Morocco, and eventually even Syria. More often, I’d see the\nPresident’s deft diplomacy second-hand, through intercepts of Arab leaders’\ncommunications with one another. But the picture which emerged was of an\nAmerican president deftly able to stake out common ground, and common\ninterests, with each of the Americans’ growing number of anti-Saddam allies.\n\nWhen we entered the Oval Office on the evening of February 11, Bush was\nflanked by Secretary of State Baker, Defense Secretary Cheney and national\nsecurity adviser Brent Scowcroft. Also there was Colin Powell, a general whom\nI had got to know well, and to like, over the past few years and who was now\nhead of the joint chiefs-of-staff. Given the seriousness of our mission, the start\nof the meeting was almost surreal. The Americans had obviously been told that\nI was born on February 12. Since it was just past midnight in Israel, they began\nby wishing me a happy 49\" birthday.\n\nYet pleasing thought that was, it became clear there was a disconnect\nbetween the tension among Israeli government ministers, and ordinary Israelis,\nback home and the relaxed, self-assured, at times even jovial mood of the\nPresident and his inner circle. Their primary focus was clearly not on Israel, but\non the overwhelming success of their air attacks on Iraq and the approach of a\nground offensive that they were confident would finish the job. That didn’t\nseem to change even after a truly extraordinary interruption to our meeting,\nwhen one of Misha’s aides passed on the news that a Scud had struck the Tel\nAviv suburb of Savyon, where Misha himself ltved. He immediately excused\nhimself and went to phone his wife, Muriel, to confirm she was fine. When he\nreturned, despite their pro forma words of empathy, it seemed almost as if the\nAmericans thought we had cooked up the entire thing for political effect.\n\nBush did say the right things as the discussion turned to the missile attacks\non Israel. He told us he understood our frustration, and the pain the Scud\nlaunches were inflicting. He appreciated our restraint. I have no doubt that all of\nthat was true. But the message we’d been sent to deliver clearly wasn’t hitting\nhome. As politely but as clearly as I could, I told President Bush that while we\ndidn’t want to do anything to undermine the coalition, unless someone else took\ncare of the Scuds, we would have no choice but to act.\n\n237\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028085\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

(This idealization ignores the possibility that our minds are composed of\nsubsystems with incompatible preferences; if true, that would limit a machine’s ability to\noptimally satisfy our preferences, but it doesn’t seem to prevent us from designing\nmachines that avoid catastrophic outcomes.) The formal problem F to be solved by the\nmachine in this case 1s to maximize human future-life preferences subject to its initial\nuncertainty as to what they are. Furthermore, although the future-life preferences are\nhidden variables, they’re grounded in a voluminous source of evidence—namely, all of\nthe human choices ever made. This formulation sidesteps Wiener’s problem: The\nmachine may learn more about human preferences as it goes along, of course, but it will\nnever achieve complete certainty.\n\nA more precise definition is given by the framework of cooperative inverse-\nreinforcement learning, or CIRL. A CIRL problem involves two agents, one human and\nthe other a robot. Because there are two agents, the problem is what economists call a\ngame. It is a game of partial information, because while the human knows the reward\nfunction, the robot doesn’t—even though the robot’s job is to maximize it.\n\nA simple example: Suppose that Harriet, the human, likes to collect paper\nclips and staples and her reward function depends on how many of each she has. More\nprecisely, if she has p paper clips and s staples, her degree of happiness is Op + (1-0)s,\nwhere @ is essentially an exchange rate between paper clips and staples. If @1is 1, she\nlikes only paper clips; if @ is 0, she likes only staples; if 0 is 0.5, she is indifferent\nbetween them; and so on. It’s the job of Robby, the robot, to produce the paper clips and\nstaples. The point of the game is that Robby wants to make Harriet happy, but he doesn’t\nknow the value of @, so he isn’t sure how many of each to produce.\n\nHere’s how the game works. Let the true value of 0 be 0.49—that is, Harriet\nhas a slight preference for staples over paper clips. And let’s assume that Robby has a\nuniform prior belief about 6—that is, he believes @ is equally likely to be any value\nbetween 0 and 1. Harriet now gets to do a small demonstration, producing either two\npaper clips or two staples or one of each. After that, the robot can produce either ninety\npaper clips, or ninety staples, or fifty of each. You might think that Harriet, who prefers\nstaples to paper clips, should produce two staples. But in that case, Robby’s rational\nresponse would be to produce ninety staples (with a total value to Harriet of 45.9), which\nis a less desirable outcome for Harriet than fifty of each (total value 50.0). The optimal\nsolution of this particular game is that Harriet produces one of each, so then Robby\nmakes fifty of each. Thus, the way the game is defined encourages Harriet to “teach”\nRobby—as long as she knows that Robby is watching carefully.\n\nWithin the CIRL framework, one can formulate and solve the off-switch\nproblem—that is, the problem of how to prevent a robot from disabling its off-switch.\n(Turing may rest easier.) A robot that’s uncertain about human preferences actually\nbenefits from being switched off, because it understands that the human will press the\noff-switch to prevent the robot from doing something counter to those preferences. Thus\nthe robot is incentivized to preserve the off-switch, and this incentive derives directly\nfrom its uncertainty about human preferences.’\n\nThe off-switch example suggests some templates for controllable-agent\n\nT See Hadfield-Menell et al., “The Off-Switch Game,” https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08219. pdf.\n\n34\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016254\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

These recognized entities, called percepts, are passed to the workspace,\nwhere a model of the agent’s current situation is assembled.\n\nWorkspace structures serve as cues to the two forms of episodic memory, yielding both short\nand long term remembered local associations. In addition to the current percept, the workspace\ncontains recent percepts that haven’t yet decayed away, and the agent’s model of the then-\ncurrent situation previously assembled from them. The model of the agent’s current situation is\nupdated from the previous model using the remaining percepts and associations. This updating\nprocess will typically require looking back to perceptual memory and even to sensory memory,\nto enable the understanding of relations and situations. This assembled new model constitutes\nthe agent’s understanding of its current situation within its world. Via constructing the model,\nthe agent has made sense of the incoming stimuli.\n\nNow attention allocation comes into play, because a real agent lacks the computational re-\nsources to work with all parts of its world-model with maximal mental focus. Portions of the\nmodel compete for attention. These competing portions take the form of (potentially overlap-\nping) coalitions of structures comprising parts the model. Once one such coalition wins the\ncompetition, the agent has decided what to focus its attention on.\n\nAnd now comes the purpose of all this processing: to help the agent to decide what to do\nnext. The winning coalition passes to the global workspace, the namesake of Global Workspace\nTheory, from which it is broadcast globally. Though the contents of this conscious broadcast\nare available globally, the primary recipient is procedural memory, which stores templates of\npossible actions including their context and possible results.\n\nProcedural memory also stores an activation value for each such template — a value that\nattempts to measure the likelihood of an action taken within its context producing the ex-\npected result. It’s worth noting that LIDA makes a rather specific assumption here. LIDA’s\n“activation” values are like the probabilistic truth values of the implications in CogPrime’s\nContext \\ Procedure > Goal triples. However, in CogPrime this probability is not the same as\nthe ShortTermImportance “attention value” associated with the Implication link representing\nthat implication. Here LIDA merges together two concepts that in CogPrime are separate.\n\nTemplates whose contexts intersect sufficiently with the contents of the conscious broadcast\ninstantiate copies of themselves with their variables specified to the current situation. These\ninstantiations are passed to the action selection mechanism, which chooses a single action from\nthese instantiations and those remaining from previous cycles. The chosen action then goes to\nsensorimotor memory, where it picks up the appropriate algorithm by which it is then executed.\nThe action so taken affects the environment, and the cycle is complete.\n\nThe LIDA model hypothesizes that all human cognitive processing is via a continuing iter-\nation of such cognitive cycles. It acknowledges that other cognitive processes may also occur,\nrefining and building on the knowledge used in the cognitive cycle (for instance, the cognitive\ncycle itself doesn’t mention abstract reasoning or creativity). But the idea is that these other\nprocesses occur in the context of the cognitive cycle, which is the main loop driving the internal\nand external activities of the organism.\n\n4.5.9.1 Avoiding Combinatorial Explosion via Adaptive Attention Allocation\n\nLIDA avoids combinatorial explosions in its inference processes via two methods, both of which\nare also important in CogPrime :\n\ne combining reasoning via association with reasoning via deduction\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013003\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Sunday/ Monday sanction rhetoric from ranging from g8 expulsion to Iran-style bank embargo is\nraised a notch. Russia follows with more threats of counter-sanctions. My sense is the Obama 5m of 696m SPR release is to show\nMerkel and co he will step in. He needs to because there are 8 small European and Baltic countries that rec 70%+ of their gas from\nRussia. Germany gets 30%.\n\nCross asset correlations outside of the US are increasing past few days - eg copper and the Turkish lira hourly charts are on top of each\nother past 4 days. I'm worried there is a 30-40pct(?) chance of a hard risk off move in markets in first half of next week - more focused\non European equities, copper, EM FX (Turkey, ZAR, Ruble etc) than SPX.

The ideas he stood for need\nproclaiming louder than ever today. We need an optimistic vision of life’s destiny ---\nin this world, and perhaps far beyond it. We need to think globally, we need to think\nrationally, we need to think long-term. Carl’s influence was immense, through his\nscience and — most of all, through his eloquence and global outreach.\n\nIn this talk I’ll try to address some themes that would have engaged him..\n\nWe've been familiar with this image [Earthrise] for nearly 50 years -it’s iconic for\nenvironmentalists. .\n\nBut suppose some hypothetical aliens had been watching the Earth for its entire\nhistory, what would they have seen? Over nearly all that immense time, 4.5 billion\nyears, things would have changed very gradually. The continents drifted; the ice cover\nwaxed and waned; successive species emerged, evolved and became extinct.\n\nBut in just a tiny sliver of Earth's history - the last one millionth part, a few\nthousand years - the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before. This\nsignalled the start of agriculture. Changes in land-use accelerated as human\npopulations rose.\n\nThen came even faster changes. The carbon dioxide in the atmosphere began to\nrise anomalously fast. The planet became an intense emitter of radio waves. And\nsomething else unprecedented happened: small projectiles launched from the planet's\nsurface escaped the biosphere completely. Some were propelled into orbits around\nthe Earth; some journeyed to the Moon and planets.\n\nIf they understood astrophysics, the aliens could confidently predict that our\nbiosphere would face doom in a few billion years when the Sun flares up and dies.\nBut could they have predicted this unprecedented runaway fever -- less than half way\nthrough the Earth's life?\n\nAnd what might they see if they watched for another century? Will this spasm be\nfollowed by silence? Or will stability ensue? And will more projectiles leave the Earth\nto establish oases of life elsewhere?\n\nThese are the questions I'll speculate about\n\nSome years ago I wrote a book which I entitled 'Our Final Century ?' My publisher\ndeleted the question-mark.

In some\ncognitive models, the working memory and long-term memory versions of a memory type and\ncorresponding cognitive processes, are basically the same thing. CogPrime is mostly like this\n— it implements working memory as a subset of long-term memory consisting of items with\nparticularly high importance values. The distinctive nature of working memory is enforced via\nusing slightly different dynamical equations to update the importance values of items with\nimportance above a certain threshold. On the other hand, many cognitive models treat working\nand long term memory as more distinct than this, and there is evidence for significant functional\nand anatomical distinctness in the brain in some cases. So for the purpose of the integrative\ndiagram, it seemed best to leave working and long-term memory subcomponents as parallel but\ndistinguished.\n\nFigure 5.4 also encompasses metacognition, under the hypothesis that in human beings and\nhuman-like minds, metacognitive thinking is carried out using basically the same processes as\nplain ordinary deliberative thinking, perhaps with various tweaks optimizing them for thinking\nabout thinking. If it turns out that humans have, say, a special kind of reasoning faculty\nexclusively for metacognition, then the diagram would need to be modified. Modeling of self\nand others is understood to occur via a combination of metacognition and deliberative thinking,\nas well as via implicit adaptation based on reactive processing.\n\nPERCEPTUAL SUBSYSTEMS\n\nMORE ABSTRACT ASPECTS\nOF SENSORIMOTOR MEMORY\n\nary SOMATO- |\nOLFACTION SENSORY\nVISION AUDITION\nHIERARCHY HIERARCHY\n\nACTION\nHIERARCHY\n\nFig. 5.5: Architecture for Multimodal Perception\n\nFigure 5.5 models perception, according to the basic ideas of deep learning theory.

In particular, Wiener’s applications of cybernetic\nconcepts to the brain and to computerized perception are the direct precursors of today’s\nneural-network-based deep-learning circuits, and of artificial intelligence itself. But\ncurrent developments in these fields have diverged from his vision, and their future\ndevelopment may well affect the human uses both of human beings and of machines.\n\nWhat Wiener Got Wrong\n\nIt is exactly in the extension of the cybernetic idea to human beings that Wiener’s\nconceptions missed their target. Setting aside his ruminations on language, law, and\nhuman society for the moment, look at a humbler but potentially useful innovation that he\nthought was imminent in 1950. Wiener notes that prosthetic limbs would be much more\neffective if their wearers could communicate directly with their prosthetics by their own\nneural signals, receiving information about pressure and position from the limb and\ndirecting its subsequent motion. This turned out to be a much harder problem than\nWiener envisaged: Seventy years down the road, prosthetic limbs that incorporate neural\nfeedback are still in the very early stages. Wiener’s concept was an excellent one—it’s\njust that the problem of interfacing neural signals with mechanical-electrical devices is\nhard.\n\nMore significantly, Wiener (along with pretty much everyone else in 1950)\ngreatly underappreciated the potential of digital computation. As noted, Wiener’s\nmathematical contributions were to the analysis of signals and noise and his analytic\nmethods apply to continuously varying, or analog, signals. Although he participated in\nthe wartime development of digital computation, he never foresaw the exponential\nexplosion of computing power brought on by the introduction and progressive\nminiaturization of semiconductor circuits. This is hardly Wiener’s fault: The transistor\nhadn’t been invented yet, and the vacuum-tube technology of the digital computers he\nwas familiar with was clunky, unreliable, and unscalable to ever larger devices. In an\nappendix to the 1948 edition of Cybernetics, he anticipates chess-playing computers and\npredicts that they’ll be able to look two or three moves ahead. He might have been\nsurprised to learn that within half a century a computer would beat the human world\nchampion at chess.\n\nTechnological Overestimation and the Existential Risks of the Singularity\n\nWhen Wiener wrote his books, a significant example of technological overestimation was\nabout to occur. The 1950s saw the first efforts at developing artificial intelligence, by\nresearchers such as Herbert Simon, John McCarthy, and Marvin Minsky, who began to\nprogram computers to perform simple tasks and to construct rudimentary robots. The\nsuccess of these initial efforts inspired Simon to declare that “machines will be capable,\nwithin twenty years, of doing any work a man can do.” Such predictions turned out to be\nspectacularly wrong. As they became more powerful, computers got better and better at\nplaying chess because they could systematically generate and evaluate a vast selection of\npossible future moves. But the majority of predictions of AI, e.g., robotic maids, turned\nout to be illusory.

Among the questions were the following:\n“Did you have an extramarital sexual affair with Monica\nLewinsky?”\n\n“Tf she told someone that she had a sexual affair with you beginning\nin November of 1995, would that be a lie?”\n\n“T think I used the term “sexual affair.” And so the record is\ncompletely clear, have you ever had sexual relations with Monica\nLewinsky, as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit 1, as\nmodified by the Court?”\n\nClinton answered as follows:\n\n“T have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. I’ve\nnever had an affair with her.”\n\nHis answer was based on the following definition of sexual relations accepted by the judge:\n\nFor the purpose of this deposition, a person engages in “sexual\nrelations” when the person knowingly engages in or causes\n\n1. contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner\nthigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse\nor gratify the sexual desire of any person;\n\n“Contact means intentional touching, either directly or through\nclothing.\n\nUnder that definition, oral sex does constitute sexual relations. After the Jones lawyers\ncompleted their questioning, the President’s own lawyer, Robert Bennett, asked the following\nquestion:\n\n“Tn paragraph eight of her affidavit, [Monica Lewinsky] says this, ‘I\nhave never had a sexual relationship with the president, he did not\npropose that we have a sexual relationship, he did not offer\nemployment or other benefits in exchange for a sexual relationship,\nhe did not deny me employment or other benefits for reflecting a\nsexual relationship.’\n\n271\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017358\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

It is critical to stop repressing yourself and get out of the postponement habit.\n\nLet’s suppose you decide to dip your toe in dreams like relocating to the Caribbean for island-hopping\nor taking a safari in the Serengeti.

First, unlike their coun-\nterparts in the private sector, espionage headhunters ask their\ncandidates not only to take on a new job but also to keep their\nemployment secret from their present employer. Second, they ask\nthem to surreptitiously steal documents from him. Because they are\nasking candidates to break the law, espionage services, unlike their\ncorporate counterparts in headhunting, obviously need to initially\nhide from the candidates the dangerous nature of the work they will\ndo. Depending on the targeted recruit, they might disguise the task\nas a heroic act, such as righting an injustice, exposing an illegal gov-\nernment activity, or countering a regime of tyranny.

On August 23, the Lebanese parliament elected Bashir\nGemayel as the country’s new president.\n\nDuring the several weeks that followed, there was a confident feeling among\nArik and his inner circle in the Airya. To the extent that Arik and Raful saw any\ncloud on the horizon, it was their concern about “several thousand” Palestinian\nfighters who they were certain had stayed on in Beirut despite the evacuation.\nTrue, Bashir Gemayel hadn’t been formally inaugurated as president. There had\nbeen reports that he was privately assuring Lebanese Muslim leaders that he\nwould be conciliatory once he took office, and that he was not about to consider\na formal peace with Israel. He had also been resisting Israeli efforts to make an\nearly, public show of friendship, such as an official visit to meet Prime Minister\nBegin. But there was an undisguised hope that this was just a brief political\nhiatus, for appearance’s sake, and that before too long Lebanon would become\nthe second Arab country to make peace with Israel. Not just peace, but\nsomething more nearly like an alliance.\n\nThough I still looked through the eyes of an army officer, not a politician\nand certainly not an experienced diplomat, I had serious doubts this would\nhappen. Simple logic seemed to suggest that, since Gemayel knew we had no\nrealistic option of turning our back on him, his political interests were best\nserved by keeping his distance and trying to build bridges at home. But on the\nearly evening of September 14, nine days before his scheduled inauguration, not\njust that question but the whole new political edifice Arik had envisaged in\nlaunching the invasion, became suddenly, irretrievably, irrelevant.\n\nI was at my desk on the third floor of the kirya, getting ready to go home,\nwhen the news broke: a huge bomb had exploded at the Phalangist Party\nheadquarters in east Beirut as Gemayel was beginning to address hundreds of\nsupporters. For a while, the reports from Beirut suggested that Gemayel had\nsurvived the blast, but shortly before eleven at night the confirmation came: the\npresident-elect was dead.\n\n204\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028052\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

He’s been sleeping with one of my daughters\nand acting inappropriately with another one.” I again asked her if she was serious, since the\nallegations seemed so out of character.

I told her I would, and that I would\nbring my wife, who is a PhD psychologist with extensive experience in such matters.\n\nWe drove to Connecticut and Mia greeted us. She was fixing a leaky roof while trying to take\ncare of her numerous children, including a blind girl and a crack baby, who she had adopted. She\ntold me that Woody had started an affair with her adopted Korean daughter, Soon-Yi. I asked\nher how old Soon-Yi was and she told me nobody knew for sure because she was adopted when\nshe was a baby and she could be anywhere from 17 to 19. She then told me that Woody had been\nseen by one of the nannies touching her year old daughter, Dylan, in an inappropriate way.\nShe also told me that Dylan had told her that Woody had taken her up to an attic crawl space\nwhere he had also touched her inappropriately. She showed me the crawl space. She also\nshowed me naked Polaroids that Woody had taken of Soon Yi, that she had found in Woody’s\napartment, along I with a naked photo of Dylan. My wife Carolyn then had a conversation with\nDylan about her relationship with Woody.\n\nI was shocked beyond belief and asked how I could help.

He said he has a trove\nof emails between Ransome and the reporter that prove she is a “lunatic.”\n\n“There are hundreds of emails in which she claimed to have sex with everybody in the world and\nalso claimed she has video of Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and others having sex\nwith underage girls — but she never ever accused me in these emails,” Dershowitz said.\n\nThe emails are under seal, he said, and therefore cannot be made public. Dershowitz said he has\nasked the court to unseal them but his efforts thus far have been unsuccessful.\n\nIn the recent court transcript, however, it is Maxwell’s attorney, Laura Menninger — not\nRansome or her attorneys — who named Dershowitz.\n\n“[Ransome] has alleged not only that my client [Maxwell] ran a sex trafficking organization but\nshe claims also that she was directed by my client and the Epstein defendants to have sex with\nthird parties, including Alan Dershowitz, for example,” Menninger said. “And so to the extent\nmy client or Mr. Dershowitz or anyone else is going to be asked about their private sexual\nactivity, I believe that would implicate their privacy rights...”\n\nRoberts, who now lives in Australia, said that Epstein ordered her to have sex with Dershowitz\nsix times, according to a 2015 affidavit, which was filed in connection with an unrelated Epstein\nfederal lawsuit.\n\nAt that time, Dershowitz launched a media blitz on TV asserting that Roberts made up the story.\nHe also called for Roberts’ lawyers — Edwards and University of Utah law professor Paul Cassell\n— to be disbarred. The lawyers sued Dershowitz for defamation, and the case was settled last\nyear.\n\nDershowitz publicly declared he was vindicated after a federal judge ordered Roberts’ affidavit\nstricken from the court record. But the judge did not address the veracity of her sexual\nmisconduct claims; he instead ruled that the affidavit was misplaced in a case not involving\nDershowitz.\n\nBoies, whose firm represented Roberts pro bono, addressed Dershowitz’s longstanding\ncontention that he had been exonerated.\n\n“Anytime in a lawsuit where you were the defendant and you paid the plaintiff $900,000 to\nsettle it — that’s a strange kind of vindication,” Boies said, asserting that Dershowitz paid that\namount as part of the defamation settlement with Edwards and Cassell.\n\nIn 2016, Dershowitz released a statement following what he said was “an independent\ninvestigation” that had been conducted by former FBI Director Louis Freeh, who is now a\nprivate consultant.\n\n“Our investigation found no evidence to support the accusations of sexual misconduct against\nProfessor Dershowitz. In fact, in several instances, the evidence directly contradicted the\naccusations made against him,” Freeh wrote.\n\nMost of the court records in the Roberts case are sealed. In February, the Miami Herald filed a\nmotion in the Southern District of New York, seeking access to documents.

My passion is the Italian Renaissance and the rich history behind it, especially the works of 15th century masters\nsuch as Masaccio and Bellini. Some of the courses that NYU offers such as “Early masters of Italian Renaissance painting” and\n“Florentine Villas: An Interpretation Based on Historical, Social Factors” are, therefore appealing to me. What I find exciting, is not\nonly the visual aesthetics and analysis of these masterpieces, but also the manner in which the Renaissance emphasised\n\nscientific and economic innovation, areas of study the Global Liberal Arts programme would offer. NYU’s unique campus in\nFlorence would give me a once in lifetime opportunity to spend a year immersing myself in the art, culture and history of Italy. This\nwould be an exciting experience to have while studying for a Bachelor’s degree in Art History, and would compliment my main\ninterests in the subject.\n\nAs one of the prime cultural centres in the world, NYU’s location in NYC ts the perfect place to broaden knowledge within\ncontemporary art. Iam very much looking forward to visiting the Whitney Biennia this May. In addition the New museum, which\nshows a lot of the kind of work I find interesting is a short walk away from campus.\n\nTaking advantage of being based in central London for the past year, I have completed the Chairman’s Programme at Christies,\nwork experience at the Courtauld Gallery and I will be working at Maddox Gallery in the near future. Similarly, I want to take\nadvantage of being based in NYC to gain as much experience as possible. I have chosen to apply Early Decision to NYU as it is the\nonly American university I will be applying to, as there is no better place to obtain experience of the contemporary art world than\nNew York City.\n\nEssay 2.\n\nFrom the age of extremes to the age of bewilderment\n\nWhat captivates me more than anything else is the different ideological phases of the 20th century and how art can be used as\na tool of advancement and reflection on ideological and political developments.\n\nMy fascination began when I read; Eric Hobsbawm’s “Age Of Extremes” and has since developed through books such as\n\nBenjamin Carter Hett’s “The Death Of Democracy” and Yuval Harari “A Brief History Of Tomorrow” and “21 Lessons For\nThe 21st Century”.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033416\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

LEFKOWITz, Esq.\n\nMay 19, 2008\nPAGE 2 OF 6\n\nBackground\n\n_ The Agreement was the product of months of negotiations. Specifically, you requested and\nreceived numerous meetings, at the highest levels of the SDFL and DOJ’s Child Exploitation and\nObscenity Section (CEOS) concerning claims that (a) the investigation merely produced evidence\nof telatively innocuous sexual conduct with some minors who, unbeknownst to Epstein,\nmisrepresented their ages; (b) the authorities investigating Epstein engaged in misconduct; (c) the\ncontemplated federal statutes have no applicability to this matter; and (d) the federal authorities\ndisregarded the fundamental policy against federal intervention with state criminal proceedings.\nAftercareful review, the SDFL ultimately rejected those claims. Subsequent to its decision, however,\nbut before proceeding any further, the SDFL provided you with 30 days to appeal the decision to the\nAssistant Attorney General of the United States, Alice Fisher. As you recall, you chose to forego an\nappeal to AAG Fisher, and instead pursued a negotiated resolution which, ultimately, resulted in the\n\n_ execution of the Agreement.\n\nThe Negotiation Phase\n\nDuring negotiations, you tried to avoid a resolution that called for incarceration and\nregistration as a sexual offender — both of which would be triggered by a successful federal\nprosecution. The SDFL believed and continues to believe that should this matter proceed to trial,\nyour client would be convicted of the federal statutes identified in the Agreement. In order to achieve\na global resolution, the SDFL indicated a willingness to defer to the State the length of incarceration;\nhowever, it remained adamant that Epstein register as a sex offender and that all victims identified\nduring the investigation remain eligible for compensation. In order to achieve this result, the parties\nconsidered two alternatives, a plea to federal charges that limited Epstein’s sentencing exposure, or,\nas suggested by you, a plea to state charges encompassing Epstein’s conduct. Ultimately, the parties\nagreed to, inter alia, a plea to the state charges outlined in the Agreement, registration and a method\nof compensation.\n\nThe Agreement\n\nThe crux of the Agreement defers in favor of the State federal prosecution of Epstein for his\nsexual conduct involving those minor victims identified as of September 24, 2007, in exchange for\na guilty plea to a state-offense that requires registration as a sex offender; a sufficient term of\nimprisonment; and a method of compensation for the victims such that they would be placed in the\nsame position as if Epstein had been convicted of one of the enumerated offenses set forth in Title\n18, United States Code, Section 2255. Specifically, the Agreement mandates, inter alia, (1) a guilty\nplea in Palm Beach County Circuit Court to solicitation of prostitution (F1. Stat. Section 796.07) and\nprocurement of minors to engage in prostitution (FI. Stat. Section 796.03) (an offense that requires\nhim to register as a sex offender); (2) a 30-month sentence including 18 months’ incarceration in\ncounty jail; (3) a methodology to compensate the victims identified by the United States; (4) entry\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012199\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

On the contrary, a principal purpose of my chapter is to show that\n\n1. one purpose of protecting these individuals had been to protect a valued intelligence connection\n(the \"al-Qaeda connection,\" if you will);\n\n2. one major intention of the 9/11 Commission Report was to continue protecting this connection;\n\n3. those on the 9/11 Commission staff who were charged with this protection included at least one\ncommission member (Jamie Gorelick), one staff member (Dietrich Snell), and one important witness\n(Patrick Fitzgerald) who earlier had figured among the terrorists’ protectors.\n\nIn the course of writing this chapter [Scott continues], | came to another disturbing conclusion | had\nnot anticipated. This is that a central feature of the protection has been to defend the 9/11\nCommission's false picture of al-Qaeda as an example of non-state terrorism, ignoring not just the\nCIA but also the royal families of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. In reality, as | shall show, royal family\nprotection from Qatar and Saudi Arabia (concealed by the 9/11 Commission) was repeatedly given to\nkey figures like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged “principal architect of the 9/11 attacks.” The\nestablishment claims that the wars fought by America in Asia since 9/11 have been part of a global\n“war on terror.” But this “war on terror” has been fought in alliance with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and\nPakistan - precisely the principal political and financial backers of the al-Qaedist networks the United\nStates has supposedly been fighting. Meanwhile the most authentic opponents in the region of these\nSunni al-Qaedists - the governments of Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Iran - have found themselves\noverthrown (in the case of Iraq and Libya), subverted with U.S. support (in the case of Syria), or\nsanctioned and threatened as part of an “axis of evil” (in the case of Iran). We should not forget that,\njust one day after 9/11, “Rumsfeld was talking about broadening the objectives of our response and\n‘getting Iraq.”\n\n(pp. 44-45, The American Deep State)\n\nClinton's daughter is now poised to work global health initiatives which | would suggest is little more\nthan a cover for on-going terrorism \"ops\".\n\nTo return to Steve Colo - in the interview he speaks of a partnership between the Secret Service, the\nFBI, and South Carolina's SLED (State Law Enforcement Division) to open a Computer Crime Center.\nBud Horton (mentioned above) (long-affiliated with IT Security; his title at Accenture was Chief\ntechnology officer of it's cyber security practice) happened to have just moved to South Carolina from\nLoudoun County after being implicated in a continuing child sex scandal (see details below). Further,\ncyber-crime just so happens to be another of the arenas in which our Intelligence Community\ncoordinates with the Russians: \"The US cooperates with the FSB and Russia's interior ministry on\ncounter-terrorism, organized crime, bio-terrorism, and cyber-crime.\" -- p. 243, Expelled: A Journalist's\nDescent into the Russian Mafia State, by Luke Harding) Most would interpret this quote to suggest\nthat the nations work together to prevent these various threats.

Eventually, he was cleared of all\ncharges and continued to practice law in the newly united Germany.\n\nHuman rights in Israel\n\nA human rights case that surely tested my commitment to universal rights involved an Arab-Israeli\nwho was accused by Israel of assisting terrorism. He was being held in administrative detention,\ninstead of being formally charged with a crime. I was in Israel at the time writing a long article on\nthe practice of administrative detention (or as Americans call it “preventive detention”). I was\ncritical of the practice though I understood why some Israelis believed it was necessary to combat\nterrorism. After meeting the Israeli-Arab in the detention center and reviewing his case, I\nconcluded that his detention was unjustified. I met with Israeli officials and urged them to\nreconsider his case. They did, and they released him. He moved to Lebanon where he became an\nactive member of the more moderate wing of the Palestine Liberation Organization. To my\nknowledge, he has never engaged in any acts of terrorism.\n\nI helped several other Palestinian prisoners and detainees as well. I also wrote critically of and\nlitigated against several Israeli policies, including the use of unacceptable interrogation methods,\nthe overuse of wiretaps, religious discrimination against women, and de facto discrimination\nagainst Israeli Arabs. Since the early 1970s, I have been a vocal and persistent opponent of Israeli\nsettlements in the West Bank and Gaza. And after the war in Lebanon, I protested the use of\ncluster bombs that, though lawful, unduly endanger the lives of civilians. I have never believed\nthat my strong, general support of Israel is in any way inconsistent with my opposition to, and\ncriticism of, specific Israeli policies which violate neutral principles of human rights.\n\nHuman rights and wrongs in China\n\nIn 1979, Senator Edward Kennedy asked me to travel to China and report back to him on the\ncondition of human rights. The cultural revolution was just ending, and the first sparks of\nfreedom were being ignited at a place in Beijing called “Democracy Wall,” where dissidents\ngathered and posted anonymous notes. I was to be one of the first human rights advocates\nallowed into what had long been a closed society. Senator Kennedy, with whom I worked closely\non numerous human rights issues, was the key to why I was invited not only to visit prisoners and\ncourtrooms, but also to lecture on criminal law in several of China’s most important universities.\nAlthough I was invited to lecture exclusively on technical aspects of criminal law, in order to help\nChina develop a modern penal code, I managed to smuggle some discussion of human rights into\nmy lectures.\n\nDuring my visit to several prisons, I learned about a legal provision that seemed unique to China.\nWhen the sentence of death was imposed for certain types of crimes, the condemned prisoner was\nsent to a particular institution to await execution.

He truly is \nan inspiration and so is his writing. The book, which is a compilation of his speeches, was \nlaunched yesterday in Sydney. I will be sure to send you a copy, it's a brilliant read. \nI trust this email finds you well. \nKindest regards \nKatherine X \nCreativity is central to our endeavours \nBY:PAUL KEATING \n• From: \nThe Australian \nOctober 22, 2011 12:00AM \nPaul Keating is aware that many people see him as a puzzle and contradiction. During the \ninterview he explained he wrote this introduction to his book as a guide to help people see the \nunifying philosophy of his life, public and private. \nFRIEDRICH Schiller, the German philosopher, said: \"If man is ever to solve the problems of politics in practice he \nwill have to approach it through the problem of the aesthetic, because it is only through beauty that man makes his \nway to freedom.\" \nRomantic and idealistic as that view may seem to some, the thought is revelatory of the fact that the greater part of \nhuman aspiration has been informed by individual intuition and privately generated passions, more than it has \nthrough logic or scientific revelation. The moral basis of our public life, our social organisation, has come from within \nus - by aspiration and by light, not by some process of logical deduction. \nImmanuel Kant referred to our inner impulses as \"the higher self\", an unconscious search for truth, going deeply into \nourselves to establish who we are and what we should be. \nBeauty is about the quest for perfection or an ideal, and that quest has to begin with aesthetic imagination - \nsomething informed by conscience, carved by duty. Kant called it \"the inner command\", the ethical construct one \ncreates to guide one from within. \nBut we need tools to mine good intentions: inspirations, ones which await the creative spark, the source of all \nenlargement. Creativity is central to our progress and to all human endeavour. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029558 \nMusic provides the clue: unlike other forms of art, music is not representational. Unlike the outcome of the sciences, \nit was never discoverable or awaiting discovery. A Mahler symphony did not exist before Mahler created it. \nE.T.A. Hoffman, a contemporary of Beethoven's, famously said: \"Music reveals to man an unknown realm, a world \nquite separate from the outer sensual world surrounding him, a world in which he leaves behind all feelings \ncircumscribed by intellect in order to embrace the inexpressible.\" \nThis is not to turn our back on reason. Or to argue that modernism, with all its secular progress through education, \nindustrialisation, communications, transport and the centralised state, has not spectacularly endowed the world as \nno other movement before it. But a void exists between the drum-roll of mechanisation with its cumulative power of \nscience and the haphazard, explosive power of creativity and passion. Science is forever trying to undress nature \nwhile the artistic impulse is to be wrapped in it. \nWhile these approaches are different - perhaps often diametrically opposite - they inform related strands of thinking \nin ways that promote energy and vision. \nThis is what I have found when these forces are contemplated in tandem. When passion and reason vie with each \nother, the emerging inspiration is invariably deeper and of an altogether higher form. One is able to knit between \nthem, bringing into existence an overarching unity - a coherence - which fidelity to the individual strands cannot \nprovide. \nIn the world I have lived in, the world of politics, political economy and internationalism, the literature exists in \nabundance. But what is far from abundant are the frameworks for the intuitive resolution of complex problems that \nrequire multi-dimensional solutions. \nBut from where do we glean this extra dimensionality? \nFor me, it has always been from two sources: policy ambition in its own right and from imagination - the dreaming. \nPolicy ambition arising from Kant's higher self, and imagination promoted by those reliable wellsprings - music, \npoetry, art and architecture - blending the whole into a creative flux. \nThis collection of speeches reflects many of those interests and impulses - whether it be Joern Utzon's Opera \nHouse or the imperative of liberal internationalism in foreign policy or Neoclassicism, the future of native title or the \nrise of China. Each is related in a wider construct which is part and parcel of the way I have viewed and thought \nabout the world. \nWhile the speeches are from the period after my prime ministerial life and period in government, the impulse in \nwriting them came from the same framework and inclinations which informed my life in public office. \nThe speeches may be read individually or read together, subject to subject, idea to idea. Either way, a common \nthread informs them all. \nI trust this might be evident to the reader. \nhttp://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/creativity-is-central-to-our-endeavours/story-fn59niix-\n1226173494033  \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029559 \nPaul Keating explains as never before \n• BY:PAUL KELLY, EDITOR-AT-LARGE \n• From:The Australian \n• October 22, 2011 12:00AM \nWITH his panoramic view of world affairs sharper than ever, Paul Keating blames the current global crisis \non blunders by European and US leaders and warns that Australia must rediscover the keys to national \nsuccess. \nInterviewed in his Sydney office, furnished in a style he calls \"the last gasp of revolutionary classicism\", Keating's \nnew 600-plus page book sits atop his desk, an insight into his intellectual, aesthetic and political obsessions. \nWhat has Keating been doing since he left office in 1996? He has been travelling, speaking and analysing the world \nand Australia with undiminished intensity suggesting a man operating as prime minister-in-exile. \nHis idea of leadership is more philosophical than ever, more distant from Bob Hawke or John Howard. His focus is \nthe synthesis between beauty and reason and his book encompasses China's currency, the world malaise, Mahler's \nSymphony No2 and broaching the republic with the Queen. \nDuring the interview Keating talks, as never before, about his leadership concept. But he is doing something else: \nexplaining himself to a still puzzled nation. \n\"The great changes in civilisation and society have been wrought by deeply held beliefs and passion rather than by \na process of rational deduction,\" Keating tells me. In retirement, his political inspiration comes from music and \nbeauty, not opinion polls. \nThere are signs he has mellowed. While ruthless with his judgments Keating is keen to support a struggling Labor \nParty while addressing the source of its strategic demise. \n\"The failure of the Rudd and Gillard administrations is the lack of an over-arching story, the lack of a compelling \nstory,\" he says when interviewed last week. \n\"I'm happy that Labor took us through this dreadful financial crisis so competently. But they are not in the business \nof teaching. And governments, to succeed with change, must be in the business of educating the community. \n\"Our Labor governments have failed to conceptualise the changes. We need a framework. \n\"What is the framework? It is 'Australia in Transition' strategically and economically. That's the story we have to \npresent. \n\"I think the Australian people are very conscientious. During the 1980s and 1990s we proved they will respond \nconscientiously to necessary reforms. They mightn't like them but they'll accept them. But reforms have to be \npresented in a digestible format. \n\"I know that in the age of the internet, opinion and perpetual static it is difficult to get the message over. I accept \nthat. But the big messages have their own momentum. If we get the story of transition right then other things will find \ntheir place. \n\"Our problem is what I call shooting-star policies. We have a policy on carbon pricing, on minerals, on boatpeople, \nbut they are not connected up to the big picture about Australia's direction and its transition.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029560 \nPressed on whether he thinks the Australian Labor Party is in permanent decline, Keating defends Labor, insists it \ndoesn't have to decline but highlights the problem. \"Labor must recognise what it has created,\" he says, invoking the \nHawke-Keating era. \"It has a created a new society and it has to be the party of the new society. \n\"It can't be the party of part of the old society. Labor must be the party of those people who gained from the pro-\nmarket growth economy that we created. Labor must be open to the influences of this middle class, to people on \nhigher incomes. And I don't think it is.\" \nIt is, perhaps, the clearest statement of Labor's problem. The party, in an act of strategic folly, abandoned the path \nof its previous success. It turned inwards on itself, away from the community. \n\"At the operating level it's become the party of insiders,\" Keating says. \"The problem is that members get too caught \nup in the gift of faction managers and they get caught up in the false construct of popularity, the false god.\" \nFixated by the nature of political leadership, Keating's book After Words shouts out: \"The great curse of modern \npolitical life is incrementalism.\" \nLeaning across the table he says to me that briefing notes and economic texts aren't enough: the leader must locate \nhis own source of higher command and inner belief. He laments the efforts of US President Barak Obama and \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel in the teeth of contemporary challenges. \n\"There is nothing preordained about American decline any more than the European project is destined to fail,\" he \nwrites. \n\"But the portents are not good. Despite the rhetoric, President Obama conducts himself as an arbitrator or mediator \nbetween the competing strands of American economic and political ideology. He repeatedly eschews striking out, \nsnatching the naked flame and hanging on. But the cost of this strategy is not simply a cost to him; it is a cost to the \nwhole world. \n\"On the other hand, Chancellor Merkel is the archetypal worry-wart. She does not lead; she assesses. \n\"You really wonder why leaders want these jobs when they really do not want to lead. And what is their risk? That \nBarack Obama will not get a second term? Or that Angela Merkel's coalition might finally end up on the rocks? If \nthey actually made the leap they might astound themselves. Because, in the end, everyone in political life gets \ncarried out - the only relevant question is whether the pallbearers will be crying.\" \nFor Keating, the 20th-century leader exerting most influence on the coming century is China's Deng Xiaoping. \n\"If you look at the other figures of the century, Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin and Mao, none will leave the legacy in \nterms of the 21st century that Deng leaves,\" he says. \"He walked away from the ideology of the Communist Party \njust as effectively as Mikhail Gorbachev walked away from the essence of the Soviet Union.\" \nBy 2050 Keating sees a world order with nations in terms of gross domestic product in this hierarchy: (1) China, (2) \nUS, (3) India, (4) Japan, (5) Brazil, (6) Russia, (7) Britain, (8) Germany, (9) France and (10) Italy. \nThe key, however, is that Japan lags a distant fourth behind the top three. \nOn America, Keating is dismayed by the pivotal change in its outlook after the end of the Cold War. \"When the \nBerlin Wall came down the Americans cried victory and walked off the field,\" he says. \n\"Yet the end of the Cold War offered the chance for America to develop a new world order. It didn't know what to do \nwith its victory. This at the moment the US should have begun exploiting the opportunity of establishing a new world \norder to embrace open regionalism and the inclusion of great states like China, India and the then loitering Russia. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029561 \n\"Well, frankly, the US didn't have the wisdom. It just wanted to celebrate its peace dividend. The two Clinton terms \nand the two George W. Bush terms, that's four presidential terms, have cost US mightily.\" \nFor Keating, the malaise in US politics is the problem. He says: \"The most compelling thing I've seen in years is that \nin the great burst of American productivity between 1990 and 2008, of that massive increment to national income, \nnone of it went to wages. By contrast, in Australia real wages over the same period had risen by 30 per cent.\" \nKeating sees this \"as the breakdown of America's national compact\", the shattering of its prosperity deal. He says \nAmerican conservatives abandoned the middle ground represented by Republican presidents such as Dwight D. \nEisenhower, Richard Nixon and Bush Sr and became radicals. The derailment, he argues, began under Ronald \nReagan and reached its zenith under George W. Bush. \nWith the goodwill gone the US \"is not able to produce a medium-term credible fiscal trajectory or get agreement on \nrebuilding its infrastructure\". This paralysis \"is significant not just for the US but for the world.\" \nKeating links the collapse of this \"prosperity compact\" to the financial crisis. Too many Americans were unable to \nsustain themselves from wages and salaries. \nHow did they get by? They used the easy credit of the banking system, thereby feeding the frenzy that ended in bad \nloans and meltdown. \nKeating's book has an abiding message for Australia: in the transformed world we \"will find ourselves increasingly \non our own\" having to master our own destiny. \nThe job is to rediscover the productivity and savings agenda of the 1990s. Why did Australia survive the 2008 \nfinancial crisis? \"Because of the flexibility of the economy,\" Keating says. \"Flexibility which came from the reform of \nAustralia's financial, product and labour markets that began 25 years ago. This has given us one of the most flexible \neconomies in the world - arguably the most flexible. But further structural changes are ahead of us.\" \nHe lists them. It is a mix of the new and old Keating agenda: a shift in resources to the extractive industries; a lift in \ncapital inflow driving a high current account deficit putting a premium on savings; recognition that competitiveness \nwill lie \"in the creativity of our people as much as it does in our oil and gas\"; a renewed emphasis on the value of hi-\ntech and education; and above all, a cultural change that integrates Australia more into East Asia. \"Cultural \ntransformation is the key for us,\" Keating says. He rates it as more important than economic reform. \n\"There is less interest now in being part of East Asia than there was in the 1990s,\" he laments. \nKeating wants this idea revived. And he ties it to the republic arguing that to succeed in Asia we must become a \nrepublic, a proposition Howard always dismissed. \nOn China, Keating is an optimist yet alive to the daunting economic challenge China now confronts. \"What is \nhappening in China knows no precedence in world economic history,\" he says. \"Never before have 1.25 billion \npeople dragged themselves from poverty at such a pace. China is now half the GDP of the US and incomes have \nrisen by a factor of 10.\" He argues, however, that the origin of the 2008 financial crisis lies in the global imbalances - \nChina has built huge foreign exchange reserves by exporting too much and America, in turn, is saving too little. \nKeating says: \"China must shift the basis of growth from net exports and investment to domestic consumption. Will \nthey achieve this? Probably. Will there be strains along the way? There have to be.\" \nUnlike many Australian leaders, Keating is a Europhile. \"I think the European project is the most significant project \nsince the second world war,\" he says. But he sees two huge blunders made in Europe. \nFrom the euro's inception, Keating said it should constitute only Germany, France and the Benelux nations, not the \nperipheral countries around the Mediterranean, and \"Greece should never have been allowed in\". \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029562 \nWhy were the weaker economies given entry? \nKeating says: \"It's because president Mitterrand and the French wanted it. They weren't ready to sit beside the \nGerman unified state without some friends.\" \nSo the eurozone was flawed from the outset, a structure awaiting internal assault: \"The problem is we have a single \ncurrency without a political union and without a fiscal union.\" \nThe second blunder was the 1990s expansion of NATO to the Russian border. For Keating, this was recklessness \nfor which the world may yet pay. \n\"Sensible policy would have included a place for Russia in the new world order,\" he says. \"But that didn't happen. \nSo Russian liberals were pushed to one side by Russian nationalists. In a sense the US has created Vladimir Putin.\" \nWho is responsible? He points the finger at Bill Clinton. \nOn the 2008 financial crisis, he says former US Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan must bear \"a fair amount of \nresponsibility\". \n\"Greenspan is someone I know and like,\" Keating says. \"But if you are so naive to believe that institutions with a \nbalance sheet with assets geared at 45 to one is not an accident waiting to happen then you don't deserve to be \nchairman of the Federal Reserve.\" \nHe praises Obama for seeking a return to the \"liberal internationalism\" that, in Keating's view, made the US great in \nthe post-World War ll age. This is the US he loves but it is still in retreat. \nAsked about the nature of leadership, Keating reveals what lies within his heart: \"I believe there is a poetic strand to \nlife that doesn't exist in an economics textbook. \n\"This is not to say that rationalism isn't important and good. It is. But left to itself without the guidance of higher \nmeaning and a higher concept, rationalism can be mean and incomplete. I say if you simply live on rational policy \nand briefing notes you are not sufficiently informed. \n\"You need a higher calling or some inner system of belief - here I mention Kant and the inner command that tells \nyou what is true, what is right, what is good. The inner command must be the divining construct in what you do. \n\"Music has always been a large part of what makes me tick. You listen to a great work . . . you hear the majesty of \nthese works and your head and soul gets caught up in them. When that happens you are in for bigger things and \nyou will strike out to be better. \n\"When I was listening to music I would always have the pad out to write the ideas down.\" \nhttp://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/opinion/paul-keatinq-explains-as-never-before/story-e6frg74x-\n1226173493029  \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029563 \n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}

Ibn Khaldun’s analysis was based on his\nnative North Africa, but it can be adapted to the conditions of the\nMashreq, or Levant—where similar historical conditions prevailed.\nAs Albert Hourani explained in his magisterial History of the Arab\nPeoples (1991), ‘asabiyya is a force that informs the patriarchal\nfamily order that still underpins the structure of power in many Arab\nsocieties.\n\nIn the past, as Hourani pointed out, a ruler with ‘asabiyya was well\nplaced to found a dynasty, since the merchant classes of the cities,\nuntrained in the military arts and without powerful corporate\nstructures, tended to lack this quality. Moreover, when dynastic rule\nachieved in this way was stable and prosperous, city life flourished.\nBut in Ibn Khaldun’s time every dynasty bore within itself the seeds\nof decline, as rulers degenerated into tyrants or became corrupted by\nluxurious living. In due course power would pass to a new group of\nhardy rulers from the margins after a period of turbulence often\ndescribed as fitna, or disorder (a term with overtones of sexual\ndisharmony, for in the family context, fitna 1s seen as the outcome of\nsexual misconduct).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030088\n"}, "config": {"endpoint": "http://localhost:5002/v1", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b", "temperature": 0.4, "prompt_source": "prompts/default_system_prompt.txt", "reasoning_effort": "low", "power_watts": 100.0, "electric_rate": 0.25}}}
